I am pleased that our proposal to retain the current monitoring bodies was approved, but regret the fact that all of the others were rejected.
Â Â  . The proposals in the Lavarra report make no reference whatsoever to the negative changes being promoted with the mid-term review or to olive oil because, as it says, it considers it a , in which case all that remains is to regulate certain aspects of the olive oil market.
That is why all his amendments, which are positive in almost their entirety (such as the abolition of the practice of mixing olive oil with other fatty substances) are limited to that.
We radically disagree with the logic of considering the mid-term review for olive oil as a foregone conclusion and with the substance of the review, in other words with the uncoupling of a significant proportion of subsidies from production, freezing olive production at the levels of 1 May 1998, reducing Community appropriations for olive oil and so on.
The Commission proposal should hardly even constitute the basis for debate in the European Parliament and should be rejected in its entirety, because it creates a situation which is far worse than the current situation and does not under any circumstances satisfy olive producers.
We voted against the report, despite its individual positive points, because it accepts the mid-term review for olive oil as a foregoing conclusion.
The Communist Party of Greece calls on olive producers to fight so that the review is not implemented in practice, so that ceilings on olive production are abolished and so that subsidies are paid on actual production and to put a stop to the mockery and derision of olive producers.
Â Â  . In the report before us, I welcome the proposed amendments calling for a more satisfactory oil classification system; for the prohibition of blends of olive oil with other oils or fats; for compulsory indication on labels of the origin of the olives, with origin being determined on the basis of the tree and the place of harvesting, and not the place of pressing and processing (which gives rise to misrepresentation and trademark piracy); for greater transparency in the TPA in order to ensure that this mechanism cannot be used to brand and sell olives and oils imported from non-Community countries as Community oils; and for an increase in the threshold price which automatically triggers the private storage procedure.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  .â I am voting for this report.
We have here a proposal for a regulation to replace Regulation (EEC) No 827/68, which will cease being in force in November 2004.
It seeks a better classification of the various kinds of olive oil, the prohibition of blends of olive oil and other oils or fats, compulsory indication on labels of the origin of olives, with oil origin consequently being determined on the basis of the tree and the place of harvesting and not the place of pressing and processing, and greater transparency in the TPA.
It is also proposed that the term âoperatorsâ should be replaced with the more correct name âolive producersâ, and that producersâ organisations should not be assigned market supervision and monitoring duties, which should remain the responsibility of the existing national supervisory bodies in the olive and agricultural sectors.
Furthermore, all producers in the sector have for some time been calling for clearer and more transparent legislation.
We hope the results will meet their expectations.
Â Â  I have voted against all the amendments and, in the final vote, against this report since we are of the opinion that the EU is wrong to continue with and give more aid to olive groves than was indicated in the Commissionâs original proposal.
We think that these subsidies should be phased out and the taxpayersâ money used more appropriately.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sees increased subsidies as a problem of principle.
Since many developing countries are entirely reliant on cotton production, EU aid distorts the competition.
These countries are even less well placed than regions within the EU to solve the transitional problems that arise if part of the production is stopped.
Parliamentâs proposal means not only greater subsidies than those proposed by the Commission but also places even more specific demands on products and necessitates classification systems.
This may be commendable, but is often a way to protect against outside competition, in other words it is a hidden trade barrier that renders free trade difficult.
Â Â  . â An insult to and mockery of women is the only way to describe the European Parliament resolution on International Womenâs Day.
Any encouraging of equality of women and search for responsibility for the trivial results are wiped out by praises for ÎU policy and positive criticism of the decisions by the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits.
The harsh reality experienced by women in the EU (high unemployment rate, few, poorly paid, scarce jobs, terrorism in the workplace, lack of measures giving social support to the family, increase in the retirement age, wage discrimination and so on) is the outcome of the strategic choices of the ÎU, to which the Lisbon and Barcelona Summits gave significant momentum.
The proposals to promote women as Commissioners, to create a special portfolio for womenâs rights in the Commission, to give women equal representation on European Parliament ballot forms, to set up a European institute for gender issues etc. illustrate how far the temporary residents of Brussels are from the real problems and concerns of working class women.
How can a partially employed, partially paid, partially retired woman, which is the model being promoted or at least accepted by those who inspire such texts, become fully involved in social and political life?
That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the Guantanamo detainees quite rightly identifies the infringement of international law and human rights.
Indeed, these people, victims of the imperialist expansionism which took the form of the âwar against terrorismâ, not only are not being treated as prisoners of war, but are also being subjected to torture and every form of humiliation.
So much for the civilisation of those who present themselves as the champions of civilisation and want to give the rest of the world lessons in democracy.
Nonetheless, the report accepts the core of imperialist policy and the American perception of terrorism, justifies the attack on Afghanistan, fails to condemn the arrests and illegal detentions and confines itself to calling for a fair trial for the detainees.
That is why we MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote and are calling for all detainees to be freed at once and compensated for what they have been through.
Â Â  We Swedish Moderates agree with the demand that the GuantÃ¡namo prisoners be accorded a fair trial, and we have therefore voted in favour of the tabled report.
We are not, however, of the opinion that the prisoners necessarily fulfil the conditions of the Geneva Convention that would allow them to be considered as prisoners of war.
It is therefore incorrect for the report to invoke the Geneva Conventionâs rules governing the treatment of prisoners of war as being synonymous with the rights of the GuantÃ¡namo prisoners.
Â Â  .â This recommendation, which had its origin in an initiative in which my Parliamentary Group took part, was pressing and necessary, although I do not agree with the way all its points have been formulated.
Unfortunately, however, it is overdue, given that hundreds of people, including children, from some 40 countries, particularly countries of the European Union, have been held at the United States military base in Guantanamo Bay since January 2002 in unacceptable circumstances and conditions and without any rights or guarantees.
It is pressing and necessary that the United States authorities should put an immediate end to this flagrant violation of the most basic human rights and of human dignity, in breach of all international standards and law, particularly regarding access to a fair trial and the prohibition of arbitrary detention.
It is pressing and necessary that the governments of the countries of the European Union should stop acquiescing in this situation and adopt a firm, clear position, denouncing and condemning this unacceptable situation and demanding that the United States authorities should guarantee these detainees immediate access to justice in accordance with international standards and law.
Â Â  â Hardly anyone but this House is showing such passionate interest in the conditions under which prisoners are being kept at Guantanamo, or showing such compassion for them.
I do not share the predominant opinion in this House, in that not only do I not regard this as a priority issue, but also, to be blunt, the condition of these people inspires me with little sympathy for them.
I would remind the enlightened elite, the virtuous defenders of fundamental rights, who, at Guantanamo, see only wretched prisoners and victims of American despotism, that we are talking here about persons suspected of belonging to the most dangerous criminal organisation ever identified, active participants, to varying degrees, in one of the most bloody crimes in history, Islamic terrorists who have declared total war on the West and its values.
An exceptional situation, such as the war on international terrorism, can justify exceptional measures.
The situation of those detained at Guantanamo â an issue that, it should be added, is strictly a matter for the United States â strikes me as less deserving of interest than that of the families of the victims, about whom there is less concern.
Â Â  .â The question of the âdetention, treatment and trial of certain non-citizens in the war against terrorismâ that is occurring in Guantanamo Bay has clearly been taken up by certain European sectors as a political issue, more to hinder the smoothing of transatlantic relations than to uphold the fundamental values of the rule of law and full respect for international humanitarian standards.
The tone of the report seeks to fuel not only the rifts that occurred in Europe at the time of the Iraq war but also animosity against the US.
For my part, I too believe âthat the transatlantic relationship is invaluable and could be a formidable force for good in the world as stated by the European Council only if basic human rights â such as the right to fair trial and the prohibition on arbitrary detention â are clearly respected as universal and non-negotiable and remain the core of values and common interest that the EU and the US maintain.â
What underlies the report, however, is the fact that the demands made of the US in this report are being made because the presumed terrorists are being held in Guantanamo, comfortably far away from Europe.
I therefore voted against this report, more because of the anti-American intent that can be seen in it than because of the basic principles it evokes, which I have always upheld.
Â Â  That concludes the explanations of vote.
(1)
Â Â  â The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on enlargement and the candidate countries.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for his constructive and very close cooperation over the years.
The Czech Republicâs successes over the last few years are beyond dispute.
There are still deficits in some areas, however, on standards in food-processing establishments, for example.
Our consumers need have no fear, however; nothing that fails to meet our standards will be allowed in the EU internal market.
Another problem that has increasingly been brought to my attention recently is the suspected trafficking in human beings and in particular children at the German-Czech border.
The Czech Government should be encouraging victim support programmes here.
There is also a need for training programmes for the police and border guards to increase awareness of the issue of people trafficking and there should be greater cross-border cooperation on the basis of INTERREG.
So far as the plans for barrages on the upper reaches of the Elbe are concerned, I have managed to persuade the EU Commission that an environmental impact assessment for this project is absolutely essential and that intermodal alternatives must be worked out.
I live in the Elbe valley in Saxony, which was flooded in summer 2002, and I know what I am talking about.
Finally, I want to talk about the Czech parliamentâs intention of honouring the former Czechoslovak President Edvard BeneÅ¡.
When we have spent years dealing with the matter of the BeneÅ¡ decrees here in Parliament and I found a compromise formula that was adopted by an overwhelming majority of the plenum in April last year, I find it insensitive and provocative of the Czechs now, just before the country is to join the EU, to be passing a law that not only evokes the past but actually honours it.
I do not want anyone who supports this law joining my Group in the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, this legislative period is drawing to a close, as is the process for the accession of ten states to the European Union.
I was very interested in Estonia even before I became this Parliamentâs rapporteur for its accession, and I have visited it regularly for 11 years.
I am therefore firmly convinced that we are not just being polite when we say in the report that âthe European Parliament stresses the determination and continuity in efforts made by the Estonian authorities in carrying out the preparations for accession throughout the whole period of transitionâ.
I can see â now he has just gone out â I could see former foreign minister Toomas Hendrik Ilves in the House and I would like to thank him on behalf of all our other Estonian colleagues, for that determination, which was shown by all political camps in Estonia.
Impressive personalities, like â among others â the former President Lennart Meri, or Mart Laar, who was twice Prime Minister, have done much in the past to point the country towards Europe.
I am convinced that with the EUâs support the countryâs dynamism, which is seen especially in Tallinn, will also accelerate economic and social development in other, more remote parts.
In relation to Russia, Mr Brok has already said something about the border treaties, and I would like to add that it must also be clear that the EUâs Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia applies equally to all the new Members.
I am looking for clear answers from the Council of Ministers when on 5 March Russian minister Sergei Ivanov repeats the USSRâs â and sadly also todayâs Russiaâs â propaganda lie in ââ â that is, that the USSR did not invade the Baltic countries, but was summoned to their aid.
Such propaganda and fairy tales should no longer be spread here, and the European Union must make that clear to Russia.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am glad to be able to say, in my capacity as rapporteur on Cyprus, that the Commissionâs follow-up report confirms that the country has, to a large extent, aligned itself with the in most areas.
Satisfying though this is, it is overshadowed by the fact that, at the present time, the application of the is still in abeyance in the occupied sector of the island and that talks between the communities seem at present to have become deadlocked.
The fundamental cause underlying this deadlock is the fact that the principal negotiator for the Turkish part of Cyprus, Mr Denktash, is as yet unwilling to concede, or unable to grasp, despite the Annan plan, that Cyprus is an independent and indivisible country.
It can join the European Union only subject to the condition that it should adopt a constitution conferring upon it a single international personality and functioning federal institutions.
As is, unfortunately, confirmed by his recent statements rejecting the Annan plan, Mr Denktashâs strategy cannot be intended to do other than lead to a breakdown of bilateral negotiations.
It is fortunate that the UN plan includes two compensatory mechanisms.
The first is the plan for Greece and Turkey to intervene in the bilateral negotiations on 22 March.
This will give Turkey the opportunity to remove what is, according to the Commission, a serious obstacle to its own prospective accession, namely the absence of a solution to the Cyprus problem.
The referendum on 22 April could provide a second safety net in that, if the majority of Turkish Cypriots vote in favour of the Annan plan and of accession, the ghosts of the past can be banished to the archives of history.
The days ahead will be crucial to Cyprusâ future.
The European Parliament agrees with Commissioner Verheugen, and can do no other than hope that the people of Cyprus, both Greek and Turkish, will seize this historic opportunity.
Â Â  . Mr President, on my latest visit to the country on which I am reporting â Latvia â I gained the impression that membership of the European Union has still not found its way into the minds of the political elite.
They expected the monitoring report to praise the successes of the alignment process.
That is not its purpose, however.
Its purpose is to analyse the problems of direct and indirect relevance for coexistence within the European Union, so that integration into the European Union can be a success for all concerned.
I was pleased that the Latvian Governmentâs representative in Brussels and the countryâs former chief negotiator considers my work thorough and sound and has confirmed to me that the report correctly identifies the countryâs problems.
I would at this point like to express my thanks for the intensive discussions with the embassy and other ministries and state bodies.
The information they provided helped me to gain a realistic picture of the situation in the country.
I would also like to thank my colleagues for their close cooperation.
Unlike the Commission, I found that the work of the new Corruption Prevention Bureau can be described as effective and promising.
I am convinced that it will enable Latvia to overcome its negative image.
When I visited the country, I also met a committed minister of justice, and I am convinced that with her the reforms are in good hands and will bring success quicker than assumed in the Commission report.
I can say the same about agricultural policy.
I was also pleased to find that my report triggered a political debate about what is probably the countryâs greatest social problem, how to better integrate the Russian-speaking population.
The debate surrounding my report included a discussion of how citizenship can be achieved for what amounts to one fifth of the population and how the process can be speeded up.
I have borne patiently the accusations, condemnations and insults that have been hurled at me recently in the hope that the debate on my proposals, which after all were backed by the Council of Europe, would have a successful outcome, that is result in higher figures for naturalisation.
Contrary to what some Latvian politicians are claiming, the content of my report and the things that it calls for are identical to those of other European organisations.
We cannot accuse the Council of Europe and the OSCE High Commissioner of belonging to a particular political family.
It is of course true that in my report I did not satisfy the heroic national pretensions of part of the countryâs political elite that considers itself infallible.
That was not my aim.
I wrote this report with a sense of responsibility to the common values of our European Union.
These include the indivisibility of human dignity and I stand by that.
Â Â  . Mr President, my thanks first of all to the Commissioner and my congratulations on his excellent work.
When we arrived in the summer of 1999 at the start of our term of office, we arrived together with the Helsinki decision marking the unification of the procedure for integrating the new countries, the single wave.
Today, as our term of office nears its end, this circle is being successfully closed and this is something which is very, very serious and important for the whole of Europe.
The two months left are little time.
Today we are exercising our criticism of the new countries as colleagues, not as observers and advisers.
In this sense, I, as the official rapporteur for Lithuania, wish to confirm the important positive job which has been done in this country and helped it progress, so that in two months it will be in a position to become a fully fledged member of the European Union.
There are problems, as in all the new countries.
However, serious problems have been resolved, such as, for example, the issue of Kaliningrad, relations with the Russian Federation, the problem of the nuclear power station in Îgnalina and the problem of regional cooperation.
What do we need to do?
We need to support this effort.
To support environmental issues, to support the strengthening of the trans-European networks in the field of energy and in the field of transport, so that these countries are integrated more fully into the European structures.
As I have another identity (I am from an island in the Mediterranean, Crete), it would be an oversight on my part if I failed to mention the integration of the European Union in the Mediterranean with Cyprus and Malta.
This circle is closing and it is closing in an exceptional manner.
I hope, on the basis of what the Commissioner said to us earlier, that the relevant position of the European Union is constant, so that when Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union and the Cypriot question has been resolved, which we hope it will, the can be applied 100% to all policies in the whole of reunited Cyprus.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we look at Hungary with the respect and esteem due to a people that hopes to find within our Union not only respect for its national independence and identity but also the collective security and economic prosperity that it was denied by the communist dictatorship, which subjugated it together with so many others for almost 40 years.
We must, however, recognise that the historical step of enlargement raises legitimate questions and fears on both sides in view of the challenge of reuniting two worlds which have, unfortunately, in recent decades reached very different stages of development.
These will inevitably accentuate the differences between wealthier and less prosperous regions and will lead to an increase in the population living in the less disadvantaged regions.
It is true that we have to accept that.
It is also true, however, that the step to be taken in May 2004 is of the greatest political significance, in that it powerfully demonstrates the vitality of all the countries of Europe involved in enlargement when they are faced with the challenge that history has set for them.
My hope is, Mr President, that from that moment onwards we shall all â current and new Member States alike â have the opportunity to work together and exercise our joint responsibility in the development of the European Union.
This joint responsibility implies maintaining and even strengthening the principle of economic and social cohesion.
From this viewpoint, we see enlargement as a contract providing mutual benefits for both the new countries of the Union and the current ones whose income levels still justify the assignment of Community development aid.
In this respect, we thoroughly welcome the draft financial perspective for 2007-2013 that the Commission has just put before this Parliament.
It also implies strengthening the quality of democracy in the European institutions, where it is essential to achieve greater democratic transparency and supervision, along with greater and more effective participation by the national parliaments in the building of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, Hungary is one of those countries whose performance in preparing to join the European Union has been outstanding.
It has been my duty to accompany this development closely.
It is true that there are still a few problems that Hungary will have to overcome, but we are aware of its governmentâs determination to fulfil the commitments it has made in good time.
Rather than highlighting them now, I think it would be more appropriate to underline this countryâs success in recent years in meeting the challenges that it has faced and resolved to overcome.
Hungary, like all the other acceding countries, will at last be taking its well-deserved place as a European Union Member State.
As rapporteur for that country, I therefore call on you all to support the Brok report, which embodies years of effort and hard work and ushers in a new era in the life of the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as this is Parliamentâs last report before the historic date on which the EU is to be enlarged, I would like to make a statement in my capacities as co-chairman of the EU-Czech Republic Joint Parliamentary Committee and as rapporteur for Malta.
As the date draws nearer, expectations become all the more realistic; enlargement will not do away with every problem at one fell swoop.
Over and over again, I get letters from members of the public pointing out ways in which, contrary to the official line, BeneÅ¡ decrees are to this day being applied in cases in which compensation is outstanding.
The only comment I can make on this is that I would see a more sensitive handling of history and of such historical figures as Edvard BeneÅ¡ as being desirable.
Nevertheless, Austria is one of the countries that stand to gain most from enlargement and it is profiting, above all from strengthened trading relations with, and investments in, the Czech Republic.
As its neighbours, we were strongly supportive of its accession, in the expectation that enlargement in Central Europe would bring peaceful development and economic growth.
Turning to Malta, I cannot do other than congratulate this important small Mediterranean state, situated where Europe and North Africa meet, on its decision to join the European Union, a decision now supported by all its political forces, and also on the efforts the country has made to prepare itself for the EU.
When one considers the structural weaknesses of its shipyards and, in general terms, the need to convert a protected and insular economy into an open market economy, the adoption of the EUâs was a great challenge and a major achievement for this small island state.
All I can say to the Maltese people, though, is that they must have no fear that they, as a small country, will be swamped in something as large as the European Union.
The appointment of Mr Borg, Maltaâs foreign minister, as its Commissioner, shows the value that Malta attaches to its accession to the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, allow me for once not to talk about the large or small problems which Poland still needs to resolve in order to again take its rightful place in Europe.
For someone like me who lived through â albeit in the privileged position of foreign correspondent â the hard years of the communist dictatorship and who then went back to cover Poland as rapporteur, this is an important, and I would even go so far as to say, an emotional moment.
I would never have imagined in those years that Poland and the other former communist countries would have been restored to democracy and free and effective economic development in such a short space of time.
I believe that this is the last time that I will talk about Poland in this Chamber and I would like to send my thanks to all those who, both here and there, in Brussels and in Warsaw â I can see CommissionerÂ Verheugen here â have contributed to healing this wound in our continent.
In addition, I hope that the Poles will fully appreciate the grandeur of the European dream.
Nevertheless, I would also like to briefly mention another country: Romania.
MrÂ PodestÃ  is going to talk about this country shortly, in greater depth.
Romania still has a long way to go, but it is doing all it can to come into line with Europe and prepare itself.
We criticised Romania for its delays; it reacted by trying to put its house in order.
Now of course it needs to be watched, spurred on and monitored, but it should also be encouraged, and this is why the reprobative tone which Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne used in her report was excessive.
We therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr PodestÃ  which move precisely in this direction, that is, constructive criticism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as we know, of the ten candidate countries, Slovenia best meets the entry criteria: it had only one point that was not in its favour.
That concerned the recognition of foreign certificates of study, and the situation was resolved with the recent law.
Today, foreign certificates are officially recognised in the same was as Slovenian certificates.
There will, of course, be problems, but there is no alternative, as was rightly stated this morning by Commissioner Verheugen, the man to whom great credit is due for this enormous political and diplomatic operation.
Sloveniaâs positive situation stems both from the strong consensus among the governing and opposition parties and from the scale on which the has been faced up to and the care and skill with which it has been tackled.
Already the next objective is to enter the eurozone, an objective that, some years ago, seemed difficult when inflation was rather high, but that now seems attainable within a reasonable time, given that, at the end of 2003, inflation fell, settling at between 4% and 5%.
Slovenia has, therefore, been able to reconvert some large plants â the legacy of socialism â into small businesses that have subsequently become relatively dynamic.
In foreign policy, the issue of relations with Croatia remains open: there has recently been news of the Croatian parliamentâs ratification of the agreement on the distribution of the assets of the succession countries of the former Yugoslavia, an agreement signed in Vienna in 2001, but until now only signed by the Croatians.
Within this legally defined framework, it will therefore be easier to resolve other problems, not least that of the Croatian unilateral declaration on the exclusive Adriatic maritime environmental zone, criticised by the European Union too for being unilateral and not achieved through an agreement between all those concerned.
The general climate between Zagreb and Ljubljana has, however, recently improved and the values of security, stability and prosperity to which Slovenia aspires are those of the European Union.
Entry into the EU is recognition of the road taken towards modernising the country while respecting Community values and principles.
Congratulations and welcome, therefore, to Slovenia.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too am very tempted to say a great deal about Romania, but today, I shall confine myself to the country for which I have been responsible over the past few years, namely Slovakia.
I realise that this report is not the most important one, and may be the least important of all the reports we have produced about that country over the past six or seven years.
What is certain is that Slovakia will be joining the European Union on 1 May.
I have monitored that country for years and there is no mistaking the progress it has made in many areas.
Let this be a compliment to a small country, the last to gain its independence and whose political problems before the election of 1998 meant that it was also included late in the countries with which negotiations were taking place.
Today, we are talking about the issues that have not yet been resolved and about what is yet to happen in the acceding countries before 1 May.
In that respect, I share the Commission's view as far as Slovakia is concerned.
It is up to the government in Bratislava to do what is necessary; if not that country will have a problem after 1 May, with all the implications that this entails.
I could not agree more with what Commissioner Verheugen stated this morning: if a problem of that kind occurs, we, in the European Union, cannot resort to any compromises, but need to have the nerve to act firmly.
However, I join him in hoping that the problems will have been resolved by 1 May.
A few general remarks should not be missing from this report.
I would reiterate my concern about corruption and would encourage the government to attach high priority to continuing the fight against it.
Slovakia is continuing to improve as regards its economic performance.
Economic growth is respectable; unemployment is falling, but I doubt whether all Slovaks are reaping the benefits of that.
Although the reforms in social security, particularly to get people on benefit back to work, are recent, they appear to impact negatively on certain groups in practice.
This particularly applies to Roma in some parts of the country, particularly eastern Slovakia, where there are hardly any jobs for them.
Needless to say, such a regulation will then be ineffective.
This could have been one of the reasons behind the various unpleasant incidents that took place recently, such as the looting of shops.
There is, in itself, no excuse for such actions; they are illegal, but I should nevertheless advise the Slovaks to study their social legislation again carefully.
As Slovakia has promised to do more, and not less, for the Roma, I do not object to amendments which aim to underline this once again.
I do, however, object to amendments which accept the link between the looting of shops and the problems surrounding social security.
In my view, the former is unacceptable and something should be done about the latter.
Â Â  . Mr President, the integration of ten new countries into the European Union means mutual recognition, as the rapporteur, Mr Brok, points out, of the fact that, over and above traditional national interests, there are general European interests which every country should see as part of its national interests.
Consequently, old and new countries should stop thinking in a purely ethno-centric manner.
Besides, the whole integration procedure, as the report makes clear, speeds up progress by these countries with reforms in their economic, administrative and political environment and this is the biggest gain for their people.
In particular, I should like to express the satisfaction of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market at the fact that these countries are aligning with the in the fields of company law, accounting rules, customs law and movements of capital and, more generally, at the noteworthy results achieved as a whole in the field of transposing legislation into their national law.
At the same time, however, I would express the Committeeâs regret at the delay appearing in certain countries in the fields of trade, cross-border transactions and recognition of professional qualifications.
Here it would point out that a clear message must be sent that the huge prospects opening up for their peoples are tied in with the obligations which they have with regard to the application of Community legislation.
Â Â  . Mr President, as rapporteur of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should first of all like to congratulate Bulgaria on the progress made: 26 chapters have been completed, six others are still open, but much more remains to be done about the prospects for investment; this will involve establishing a transparent and unambiguous business climate, so that businesses know that their investments are safe and cannot be lost as a result of corruption.
As regards the nuclear power station at Kozloduy, I should like to say the following.
If it transpires from the inspection carried out in November 2003, that all the recommendations of the Atomic Question Group have been carried out, the Commission can consider postponing the closure of Kozloduy 3 and 4 for a little while longer.
If, however, this is not the case, the Commission needs to adhere to the agreed time schedule for the closure of units 3 and 4.
There is far more concern within the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy with regard to Romania.
Despite all the Romanian Government's efforts, we have to conclude that, to this day, that country has no functioning market economy.
In practice, much more is yet to be done in order to eradicate corruption and implement structural reforms in a tangible and consistent manner.
Romania's route to the European Union is difficult on account of the late start to privatisation, the late reform of state-owned businesses and the fact that its investment climate still leaves a great deal to be desired.
Romaniaâs lack of appeal to foreign investors is another reason why the rule of law should, as a matter of urgency, be further developed in the area of Romania's economy.
It is necessary to create a culture in which responsibility is accepted and laws applied.
We therefore very much welcome the proposal in the Brok committee's report for a re-orientation exercise and, at the same time, for more attention to be given to problems relating to the rule of law.
There is also a need for core sectors such as energy, mining and transport to be restructured.
All in all, Romania still has a huge effort to make.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is the last time that I, as rapporteur of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, together with Mr Ettl, can pass judgment on the preparations of the candidate Member States in the social field.
I have to say that all those countries have made unbelievable efforts to make progress in the social sphere on various fronts.
They have a number of trump cards which they can play and about which far too little is known, certainly in our countries, where people often think that the new Member States are still at an early stage of development.
Needless to say, that is not the case.
For example, the population is very well educated: 88% of 20 to 24-year-olds have at least attended higher education.
That is more than in the 15 current Member States, where this figure is 74%.
Moreover, the population in the ten new countries is younger than in the 15 current Member States.
The phenomenon of an ageing population will therefore take a little longer to make its presence felt.
In short, those countries have great potential in terms of human resources.
Utilising this potential to the full should be high on the agenda.
At present, human resources are still deployed insufficiently.
Unemployment in the acceding countries is high and opportunities for employment low.
Of the population of working age, 14.3% are unemployed, as against 8% in the European Union.
Unemployment among young people under the age of 25 has taken on tragic proportions: at 32%, it is twice that of the European Union.
An extreme case is Poland, where youth unemployment is 41%.
Moreover, in seven of the ten candidate Member States, youth unemployment in 2003 rose compared to the year before.
It is therefore obvious that those countries, in accordance with the European employment strategy, should develop active and sustainable employment policy.
Lifelong learning should keep workers deployable within the changing labour market.
The number of people between 25 and 65 who attended courses in 2002 is 5% compared to 8% in the European Union and there is also the risk of a brain drain of highly-qualified staff.
Another point is health and safety at work.
Some countries prefer to provide higher wages at the expense of health and safety provisions on the shop floor.
Purchasing power and pre-tax income are far below the EU average, but they have increased â even considerably â while they fell in our countries.
This amounts to a simply outstanding achievement.
A big problem, however, is that wages remain too low to enable people to escape poverty.
Poverty in the ten countries concerned affects 40% of the working population.
Social security should be developed more effectively.
Social partners should be organised more effectively because at the moment, they still have insufficient organisational power to be able to really organise social negotiations in the countries concerned.
Â Â  . â Mr President, although I can do no other than underline what Mrs Smet has said, the great progress made in the new Member States must not blind us to the continuing problems they have in the social sphere, or to their mounting difficulties with employment.
Economic adjustments, combined with processes of industrial restructuring under which mainly workers have suffered, is making for ever-greater problems in the new Member Statesâ labour markets.
Now, when they are on the threshold of accession, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the overall goals and ambitions of a Social Europe will remain and cannot be lowered.
The successful implementation of the Lisbon strategy in an enlarged Europe is dependent on social standards and on social legislation, both of which are means to that end.
Going beyond that, the Social Affairs Committee urges the new Member States, in their political agendas, to give more attention to human capital.
In a European Union of 25 states, there is no place for retrograde developments or social inertia, which would pave the way for new conflict.
Generally speaking, and by way of conclusion, let me say that the tendency to treat both social affairs and employment matters as âsoft lawâ is a problem in terms of the overall future development of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, fifteen years after the countries of Eastern Europe threw off the straitjacket of communism, what we are seeing is a completely new life and, in reality, new countries.
This is a fantastic achievement by these people.
As members of the EU they will, just like the rest of us, gain full freedom of movement to promote increased solidarity and strength throughout the whole Union.
In different ways during my work with enlargement, I have met many ambitious, hard-working people.
I therefore regret that, in the existing Member States, we seem to be so afraid of the workforce coming here.
I am ashamed that, in my own country, there is talk of social tourism.
This freedom of movement would mean a necessary injection into our slightly stagnated labour markets.
Agriculture is more important in these countries than in the existing Member States.
The areas are larger; three times as many people are involved in agriculture as in the present EU; and agriculture represents a larger proportion of the gross national income, that is to say, agricultural policy is more important for these countries than it really is for us.
We need a policy for all the countries.
We need, of course, to ensure that the new Member States have organisations that provide support and control and that they can tighten up food standards and the monitoring of animal and plant health.
Much has happened and, if we compare the current situation with the Commissionâs report, we can be pleased about the information that we are receiving to the effect that much of what had not been achieved by 30 September 2003 has now been achieved.
We hope that the rest can be done by 1 May 2004.
As far as the other two countries that we are dealing with, Bulgaria and Romania, are concerned, it is important to report that Bulgaria has made substantial progress in recent years and that the country deserves great praise for this.
Romania has been in a more difficult situation and has further to go in order to catch up but, even this morning, we have received reports that things are happening, and of course we must recognise this and approve of it.
Romania is the most typical agricultural country of the candidate countries, having many small farms.
Forty per cent of the population still works in agriculture, and many farms rely on subsistence farming.
A huge economic and social change is necessary in order for development to be made possible, but we must remember that we have a shared responsibility.
The candidate countries have their responsibility, but the existing Member States must also take responsibility.
The Commission must participate rather than just making demands.
It must also stimulate and make resources available.
More effective use must be made of the SAPARD resources.
Having tried to follow the developments in Central and Eastern Europe for almost 40 years, I feel sincere joy at being able to welcome these countries both on 1 May 2004 and during 2007.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what I would like to say, as draftsperson of my Committeeâs opinion, is that, where regional policy and the Structural Funds are concerned, most of the countries should, by the time they accede, already be in a position to transpose core areas of the .
It is to be regretted, though, that all of them need to make greater efforts in such important areas as financial management and financial control.
In the transport sector, it is the failure of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to make progress in road transport that is most disappointing of all.
Further decisive action has to be taken to raise safety and environmental standards and to ensure conformity with the .
As the trans-European transport networks are of great importance to the whole of Europe, not only the accession states, but also the Fifteen in the EU, need to be urged to regard the TENs not merely as a means of realising national priorities, but as making a contribution to European cohesion and to the integration of a reunited Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is pleased with the report on Romania.
There are a few aspects that I, as draftsman of its opinion, would like to highlight.
In the field of transport, Romania is making considerable progress.
Nevertheless, privatisation and restructuring in this sector deserve special attention.
In terms of safety, particularly at sea, it is known that the situation of the ships sailing under the Romanian flag is often dubious.
This House is taking this problem seriously.
Romania must resolve this issue prior to accession.
Due to the general absence of administrative capacity for regional policy, the incentives from the European funds are at risk of missing their intended purpose, while this is very much needed in the socio-economic framework.
We would ask Romania to make a major effort to upgrade the Civil Service in such a way as to guarantee good use of funds and control over them.
My amendments aim to make a few changes to that effect.
While it cannot be denied that Romania is making progress, there is still a long way to go on the road to accession.
I should like to encourage that country to walk that road with determination.
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall refer to the main points in my report, as approved.
Our committee expresses satisfaction at the progress made by Bulgaria in most of the individual sectors of transport and calls for enforcement of the to the road, railway and aviation sectors.
It calls for the removal of its flag from the Paris list to continue to be a priority for it.
It expresses its regret at the fact that chapter 21 on regional policy and coordination of structural instruments remains to be concluded.
It calls for Bulgaria to ensure that effective structures exist to prevent, detect and punish instances of fraud and corruption, especially for Phare and ISPA programmes.
It calls further for the strengthening of coordination and cooperation between ministries, as well as with relevant agencies and other stakeholders.
It considers that direct efforts are needed in effective cooperation and communication, mainly between central and regional level, where we consider that there are problems, as well as in the consolidation and completion of institutional structures at both central and regional level.
Finally, it is clear that, as far as our committee is concerned, it believes that Bulgaria has the capacity to join our Union on schedule.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it is clear that International Womenâs Day has already been forgotten, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities is, of course, the last to speak.
In this capacity, though, I do think that we should not be any less strict with the accession countries than we are with ourselves in matters relating to the complete transposition of the European Unionâs Community acquis in the field of gender equality.
Rather than focusing on what is missing,then, we should show appreciation for the progress and the reforms that a country such as Bulgaria has managed to make, under difficult conditions, since its liberation from Communist dictatorship.
After all, many countries that have been Member States for years are still having problems with properly transposing the directives on equal rights and opportunities for women and men, something that is, let me add, apparent from the Commissionâs latest report on the Lisbon strategy for the Spring Summit.
At this stage, then, in my humble opinion, we should be wary of delivering too many homilies to countries such as Bulgaria.
Instead, we should be doing everything possible to help it, and countries like it, and to encourage it and them to proceed further along the right path, on which they have encountered these difficulties, so that â as we hope â this wonderful European country can accede to our European Union in 2007.
The same applies to child protection, where there is certainly still much to be done.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor to speak about the report on Romania.
When having talks in recent weeks with the rapporteur and other Members, I tried to improve this report, but I must say that this attempt did not succeed, and this is why I have tabled some amendments on which we will vote in the House tomorrow.
It seems to me that this report is not very balanced, that it is inaccurate and inconsistent with what our Parliament has maintained to date.
Given the shortage of time, I will just concentrate on two aspects.
Firstly: the issue of children in institutions and the issue of adoption.
The serious nature of this issue should lead us to make serious and balanced assessments of the efforts made, of the improvements achieved and of what remains to be done.
Above all, claims that have not been proven should be excluded, if we do not want to offend a friendly country and if we do not want our Parliamentâs credibility to be lost.
Rigour is of course needed, but not prejudice.
Secondly, I do not agree with those whoÂ âÂ in the name of totally understandable demand to reorientate the Romanian Governmentâs policy on some sensitive issues linked to European integrationÂ âÂ fundamentally reject the results achieved to date.
I should not like to think that these hurried and ungenerous judgments were influenced by the cost of enlargement to include countries of the Carpathia and the Balkans.
If this were the case and if there were political short-sightedness of this kind, then I would like to mentionÂ âÂ as MrÂ Daul did this morning in the HouseÂ âÂ the 50 million who died during the world wars of the last century.
I believe that the only way to avoid the future risks that the recent war in Yugoslavia too has shown to be potential and real is to make progress in terms of integration.
Rigour is of course needed, but so too is understanding of the efforts made and the results achieved.
It will be much easier for a state to become fully legitimate within the EU than outside it.
I believe that 2007 must remain the target for Romania and Bulgaria.
This is not a certainty but an objective, even if âÂ as Commissioner Verheugen saidÂ âÂ the keys to this success lie above all with Sofia and Bucharest.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Union is now making its biggest political decision ever, because the difference between the new and the current Member States is greater than in previous rounds of enlargement.
Hopefully the new countries understand that the Union is not about national objectives, but making progress on the basis of cooperation.
It is to be hoped that there will be no attempt to use the Union as a forum for punishing the past injustices of the East or supporting the unilateralism of the West.
The European Union will not resolve conflicts through war or by using force, but through negotiation.
That we have learnt from our history.
The European model differs from Eastern and Western practices in that democracy also embraces civil rights at work, in education and even in the information society.
It is also connected with the rights of employees, and consequently, the tripartite model in labour relations should also become standard practice in the new Member States as quickly as possible.
The main partners in the enlarged Europe will be the United States of America and Russia.
There are political and commercial problems regarding both.
Internally we are divided to an unusual degree.
When enlargement has taken place, the Constitution will not yet be in effect, decisions will not have been taken on future financial frameworks, and the outgoing Commission will have taken the Council to court.
Two thirds of the Members of Parliament will have left even before the Commissioners.
Nationalism seems to be on the rise, and the largest Member States are pushing for privileges.
If the agreement on the Constitution is not adopted this year, that will become more and more difficult in the years to come.
Hopefully, it will not have turned out to be just a self-seeking exercise.
Enlargement will nevertheless show that peaceful and equal cooperation is what is most enduring in all circumstances.
Â Â  MrÂ President, progress in Europe over a generation shapes the response to the political challenge since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
Now, the Europe that, since the Second World War, has been divided by an Iron Curtain, both physical and ideological, is to be united.
The objective is both a political and a formal unification, as well as a real levelling out of the major economic and political differences that have divided Europe.
We must therefore be delighted about enlargement, even at those times when it proves to be problematic.
We must also remember, however, to tell the people of Europe about our common European success.
In spite of the success of enlargement and of the ever greater importance of the EU in peopleâs everyday lives, it is still a fact that we politicians are not good enough at delivering the message to the people.
Once more, therefore: in our political work, higher priority must continue to be given to informing and communicating with the people.
It may be that, in the forthcoming election, we shall already be given a lesson in the form of a disappointingly low turn-out.
It cannot, therefore, be repeated often enough: a successful EU of 25 Member States requires the politicians and the institutions to be in dialogue with the people.
Â Â  â Mr President, progress has indeed been made, but it is nevertheless an open secret that, in various accession countries, public enthusiasm for the EU has waned, and the European elections will demonstrate this.
Unemployment in Central and Eastern Europe is at a lamentably high level, never before has the gulf between rich and poor been so wide, social tensions are increasing and corruption is rampant.
The one-sided pressure exerted by the EU towards privatisation with the minimum possible delay has positively laid waste centres of industry in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia that were once vigorous.
Social instability endangers democracy, and so the Copenhagen criteria are no longer the right instrument to deal with it.
Such tendencies should be firmly brought under control and nipped in the bud.
Although individual countries have been given warnings about their treatment of the Roma, it is clear that the EU must take a Community approach, or else the problem will prove unsolvable.
It will not be achieved by states acting on their own.
The issue with the Russian minorities in the Baltic states is a political one, one in which Moscow may well appear to be exerting influence, but which is in fact a conflict centring on education and citizensâ rights, and it demands a political solution.
It is, in my view, more than a political scandal that someone like Mr TeliÄka, who has competently guided the Czech Republic towards accession, should have public doubt cast upon his appointment as its Commissioner for having, as a young man, belonged to the Communist Party for two years or so.
This is the work of the evil genius of stagnant anti-Communism, which is capable of poisoning the atmosphere not only in this House but also in the acceding states.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the remarks by our rapporteurs illustrate that the acceding countries have made major efforts, but that they still have a great deal to do in terms of the fight against corruption, fraud and human trafficking, and particularly in terms of the application of legislation.
The most painful paragraphs in various reports pertain to the Roma, who are being discriminated against, disadvantaged and treated as second-class citizens everywhere, including in the current Member States.
In Slovakia, this has already culminated in riots and even a fatality, mainly on account of the reforms implemented in Slovakia, which, among other things, mean that social security benefit has been capped and is no longer dependent on the number of family members.
This directly affecting the Roma, with their huge families, who believe that the measure is directed against them.
That is why I should like to call for more effective measures not only in Slovakia but also elsewhere in order to improve the plight of the Roma.
Moreover, the measures should not only be put in place for the Roma, but above all, they must be implemented by them, for they do not participate enough in the improvement of their own fate and their own emancipation.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with what the rapporteur, Mr Brok, says regarding the catastrophic lack of preparation of the ten accession countries.
I will focus my speech on the agricultural aspects of enlargement.
Like the rapporteur, I am concerned about the possibility of social problems such as a rural exodus and increased unemployment, and stress the importance of semi-subsistence farming in the accession countries.
Like him I note that considerable problems remain, such as the fact that the administrations of several countries are still not capable of correctly implementing Community law, including the payment of agricultural subsidies.
This situation is particularly worrying given the level of corruption in some candidate countries.
Like my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I am particularly concerned about a series of problems in the area of food safety and public health.
On 4 March, for example, barely two months before accession, Poland asked for a transition period of six to 12 additional months in order to bring some 300 agricultural and food companies in line with European rules, when they should have been ready on 1 May 2004, thereby acknowledging its lack of preparation.
It should be added that, since 2001, the ten accession countries have received around EURÂ 500Â million per year through the SAPARD funds, for the sole purpose of adapting their agriculture to their rural areas.
They are far from achieving this.
I regret the fact that this whole undertaking was conducted so hastily.
It strikes me at the moment that enlargement is like a runaway train that no one knows how to, or wants to stop.
I cannot see, therefore, how I can share in the rapporteurâs conclusions; rather, I am concerned about them.
This is why I will vote against the report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the minute I have available, I would like to talk about Romania and the Nicholson report.
This report began in committee with an approach that was appropriate right to the end and with which I and the rest of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy were satisfied.
We must send out a message that is resolute but, at the same time, full of hope to the people and the government of Romania.
Romania must proceed with greater earnestness and with greater rigour on the road of reforms, but it must get on the accession train, the European Union train.
We cannot send out a message of gloom that excludes Romania from this prospect.
It is important that our family extends to Romania, a country that needs the European Union and that needs and, in certain sectors, also wants democracy despite the existing problems.
Let us, therefore, adopt this new version of the Nicholson report with conviction, hoping that it encourages the structural reforms that are necessary for Romaniaâs entry into the European Union in 2007.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to focus on the progress Romania has made in terms of compliance with the Copenhagen criteria.
I would like to highlight two issues.
Firstly, I believe we should acknowledge that Romania is taking steps and making efforts to comply fully with these criteria.
I regret that Commissioner Verheugen did not acknowledge this.
As we all know, this does not mean that there are no more obstacles to overcome, but it is encouraging that those obstacles have been identified and that the Romanian authorities have taken measures to remove them.
The fight against corruption, as the Commissioner mentioned, to guarantee the independence of the justice system â and fundamental legislative reforms, contained in the new Constitution, are underway in this regard â press freedom, the reform of public administration, etc.
In this regard, I would like to say that some of the recommendations contained in the report by Mrs Nicholson, such as the publication of the report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, have been accepted favourably by the Romanian authorities and, therefore, I believe that paragraphs 17 and 18 have become obsolete.
And, of course, of the remaining obstacles I must mention the protection of children in international adoptions.
Secondly and finally, I would like to say that, while the adoption of concrete measures within the specific time limits is important, it is also important that all of these measures move unequivocally in the direction of full compliance with these criteria.
This has been the approach taken by the ten States joining us on 1 May and the same approach must be taken in this case as well.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as the date of accession approaches ever nearer, all the more often am I â as probably are also my fellow MEPs â asked whether we were not too hasty, and whether this accession, this enlargement, is not perhaps premature.
Of course, the date is premature if you believe that every problem has to be sorted out before accession to the European Union, but then probably none of us would be able to belong to it.
I think the date is the right one, though, if you believe that now, and from now on, is the right time to join with these countries in a common union in order to resolve these difficulties.
Whatever justified criticism may have been levelled at them, the fact is that these countries have, over recent years, worked very hard at their own modernisation and at the evolution of their societies.
All the same, I do believe that there are certain problems to which we have to pay particular attention: corruption has already been mentioned, as has crime.
One problem that I would like to stress here is the social problem, and social issues.
I do believe that what matters is not just price stability, zero deficits, and tax cuts, but that what matters most of all is that growth is achieved and new jobs created â more stable ones, too â and the need for social stability in these countries to be supported and encouraged.
Recent weeks and months have shown us the problems that there are in this area â with the Roma and Sinti in Slovakia, for example.
You can trace something of a logical progression linking these disturbances with cuts in taxes, cuts in expenditure, and cuts in social spending.
I do not want to say that this single problem is the only example, and the same is true, of course, in other countries.
Bearing in mind that the total number of Roma and Sinti in Europe adds up to some 6 or 8 million, I believe that fact very much justifies the widespread desire â which I share â for a Commissioner whose area of competence would include the integration of Europeâs minorities, especially of the Roma and Sinti.
In any case, I would ask the Commission, both before and after 1 May, to give a great deal of attention to issues of social integration, especially that of the Roma and Sinti.
I know that Commissioner Verheugen is very well aware of how important this issue is, and I believe that the whole Commission, in the coming weeks, months and indeed years, should address it together.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is concluding its process of enlargement and I believe it is no coincidence that todayâs debate has been held in parallel with the follow-up debate of the Intergovernmental Conference which should lead to a European Constitution, because I believe that the two should be inseparable.
In the one minute available to me I will refer to the report presented by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne on Romania.
I believe it is a very well executed and exhaustive report on the problems existing in that country.
It highlights the need for that country to make progress in compliance with the law and to combat corruption, as well as the need to strengthen the rule of law and respect for minorities.
I am referring in particular to the Hungarian minority of more than one million inhabitants in Romania and also, naturally, to the Roma minority.
With regard to the problem of abandoned children and adoptions, I believe the Commissionerâs response has been clear: the well-being of children must govern this process.
I believe that the report can be a positive stimulus so that Romania will continue along the path it has taken.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as regards Slovenia, some serious issues remain unresolved.
These pertain firstly to the material and non-material compensation for the victims of the exodus caused by the terrible ethic cleansing which was still in its final phase in 1975 with the forced migration from some areas, such as Piran, Koper and Pristina (the former zone B) and, secondly, to the historic memory of the and to the unresolved issue of protecting cultural minorities from Italy and the Veneto.
In Europe, protecting minorities is not optional.
Slovenia is finally taking practical note of this and knows that those who are defending and proclaiming their own culture in that country, as is their right, are motivated by legitimate intentions and aims and are, so to speak, under the moral and political protection of the European Union.
I also express my solidarity with the just demands that, at the same time, have been made of the Czech Republic by those that protect the rights of the Sudeten refugees, victims of another horrendous ethic cleansing which is stillastainuponEuropean communism.
Â Â  Mr President, today, we are holding the concluding debate on the accession of ten candidates to the European Union.
For none of those ten countries has a date been set, and so they are encouraged to consider themselves wholly responsible for the success of the accession process.
There are still two candidates, Romania and Bulgaria, that having further to row to the finishing line, and Romania is lagging behind the most.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wholeheartedly endorses the report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, which we see as an important contribution to highlighting any problems Romania is left with, particularly in a bid to meet the political criteria of Copenhagen.
This is Romania's own responsibility: the key to success lies in Bucharest, as the Commissioner has already stated.
This list of problems has prompted the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to send a unanimous warning to Bucharest.
The tone was clear enough to wake up the Romanian Government.
A reorientation of the process is what is now called for.
Initially, there was a large-scale lobby campaign on the part of the Romanian Government, with the message that reorientation was unnecessary.
Much more constructive was the more recent list by Romania's Prime Minister stating tasks yet to be done, as well as the recent Cabinet reforms, in order to give the negotiations with the EU more chance of success.
In this way, a foundation has been laid for observing the obligations of Copenhagen.
We are very pleased that the Council and Commission share Parliament's concern.
As the prospect of enlargement on 1 May instils fear of the unknown among the European citizens â as the Commissioner has already pointed out â we should apply the greatest possible care in dealing with the later accessions.
The public must be really convinced that the candidate Member States offer them the same certainties as the 15 current Member States.
Corruption, about which humanitarian organisations in our countries receive many complaints, the freedom of press, also the subject of many complaints, problems with the judiciary and child care: these are the major points that need to be discussed and resolved as a matter of priority.
The many letters they have sent indicate that this approach has sparked a great deal of enthusiasm among the citizens in Romania.
It is important to show them that we are concerned about their fate.
In this light, the contribution by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne is crucial.
Â Â  â Mr President, this House has always welcomed the accession of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe; we always spoke up for the people in these states who wanted their ticket to enter the European Union.
This fact would make it illogical to call for the suspension of Romaniaâs accession negotiations; it would send completely the wrong message.
The opposite is true: what is needed is not for the negotiations to be broken off, but for them to be stepped up.
We have to make it clear that we will now work even harder with all our Romanian partners to conclude the outstanding chapters and to resolve the countryâs problems.
That is the message that we must send to Romania today and when we vote on the report tomorrow: we will help you, but you must do the work in your own country yourselves; it is you who must fulfil the Copenhagen criteria.
It is indeed the case that Romania has a lot of time to make up; for almost ten years in the 1990s, the reform process made no headway at all.
It has to be acknowledged, though, that some chapters have been driven forward at a faster pace in recent years, and that is something that has to be supported.
We think it wrong that the report should state, in item 1, that Romaniaâs âbecoming a member in 2007 is impossibleâ.
This has to be expressed in more positive terms: it is still possible that Romania will become a Member State in 2007, provided that the problems with which we are familiar can be dealt with, provided that there is an independent justice system, that corruption is combated, that the administration is efficient and that minorities are integrated.
We have to be careful not to set the country up as too much of a scapegoat.
I see that, in items, 17, 18 and 19, we call for teaching to be provided in minority languages; I would be a happy man if people in other countries, including Member States of the EU, were able to use their own languages in schools, libraries and theatres in the way in which Germans and Hungarians can in Romania.
The reference to child marriages in item 19 has to be qualified.
The practice of children being forced into marriage is not universal in Romania, but it does occur in some Roma families.
It will be important for my group to see whether our amendments will be adopted tomorrow; if they are, we will be able to vote in favour of the report.
If they are not, we will have problems with it.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to express my support for the excellent report by Mr Van Orden on the situation in Bulgaria, which is perhaps unfortunate in Europe to be the geographical neighbour of Romania and therefore to be associated with it, when its situation is entirely different.
Today, the situation of Bulgaria is basically quite close to that of Portugal just prior to accession, with the same merits and the same potential for development, particularly in terms of tourism.
I think that we will very quickly see Bulgaria swap exporting prostitutes for importing tourists, which will be extremely beneficial for the countryâs development.
Of course, the rule of law, if it is to be effective, needs to be established through legal methods. Without the rule of law, which is vital to development, Bulgaria will be incapable of constituting, particularly from our European perspective, the frontier region that has come inside the shifting front of EU progress.
That is where our Wild West is, our very own America!
Â Â  Mr President, as our friend Mr Oostlander said: by adopting the report by Baroness Nicholson a fortnight ago, we chose to express Parliamentâs concern at the attitude of the Romanian authorities in the previous and current phases of the negotiations.
The concern was such that we doubted whether the negotiations could be concluded by the end of the year and therefore whether Romania could join us by 2007.
This strong message has today been taken on board at the highest level by Romania and we warmly welcome the personal commitments from the Prime Minister, AdrianÂ Nastase, especially as they were accompanied by very concrete initial measures, which will certainly speed up the reforms that are still needed in order for the country to conform to the Copenhagen criteria.
We should not forget that, to date, the Commission has been able to close twenty-two of the thirty-one chapters that it had to examine and that considerable progress in the fundamental areas of reform of the judicial system and in combating corruption should follow very quickly after the major cabinet reshuffle under way.
The repeal announced of the current provisions of the criminal code, which is capable of limiting the freedom of the press, and, most importantly, the swift adoption of legislative provisions aimed at better protection of children, will be further tangible proof to us of the will of the Romanian authorities.
To conclude, we welcome these encouraging signs and hope that they will enable the Commission to guarantee, in good time, that the accession of Romania will take place on the planned date, in circumstances that will ensure the good functioning of a further enlarged Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I will have no difficulty in voting in favour of MrÂ Brokâs report and the ten reports that make up this general report.
By doing this, I will be happy to contribute, in a modest but heartfelt way, to the arrival of the ten new members of the European Union.
The same applies to Mr Van Ordenâs report on Bulgaria.
It is true that the rapporteurâs comments may sometimes appear very favourable, or even too much so given the situation in Bulgaria.
On the whole, however, the conclusion of this report seems to me to be the right one.
The impression given by Baroness Nicholsonâs report on Romania is different; in fact the contrast is striking.
There is a feeling of unease when you see the indulgence of the report on Bulgaria and the severity of the one on Romania, when the two countries have a great deal in common.
Baroness Nicholson did a significant amount of work over several months to monitor the case of Romania, and I welcome her efforts.
However, the close attention that she pays to particularly painful problems, such as adoptions, led her to make very harsh judgments, so harsh, in fact, that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already significantly amended the original text, which I welcome.
Other amendments that we have tabled will, I hope, be adopted in plenary.
Finally, the resolution before us contains blatant contradictions.
Several of the provisions come from different points of view and I fear that as a whole, it lacks the coherence needed for the European Parliamentâs message to Romania to be clear, precise and firm.
I regret this, because Romania, which faces huge problems and massive underdevelopment, needs to be understood, criticised when it deserves to be, but also advised and encouraged as to the path that we wish to see it follow and which will lead it towards becoming one of us.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Parliament agrees totally with the political assessment of the Commission and of the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, GÃŒnter Verheugen, that a failure to reach agreement on Cyprus could pose a serious obstacle to Turkeyâs ambitions to become a member of the European Union.
Parliament maintains that the Cyprus question thus amounts to a major stumbling block in Turkeyâs path to accession and a political test of its European resolve.
Parliament hopes that the Turkish political authorities fully understand its significance.
I should like to cite a very important sentence in paragraphÂ 63. â[It is] hard to imagine that Turkey could join the Union when it refuses to recognise a Union Member State, has military forces occupying part of that stateâs territory, is boycotting that stateâs ships, and is barring that state from its airspace.â
I will now speak in English because the Irish presidency is not paying attention to what has been said.
What I was saying concerning paragraph 63 is that we find it very peculiar that Turkey could be a member of the European Union in a situation where it is partly occupying an EU Member State.
This is a question about the EU's credibility in the quest for peace.
We cannot tolerate the European Parliament accepting a country that is occupying a Member State of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I join with others in warning that substantial change still needs to occur in Romania but that we reject the language of rejection.
We should recognise the progress Romania has made in strengthening the Court of Audit, in judicial reform and in the introduction of the new Constitution, and we should not rule out a successful close to the negotiations this year.
Every effort must be made, in particular by the Romanians, to maintain this momentum.
However, we should signal our intent to them, and we do so by seeking to amend the resolution to replace the wording calling accession in 2007 'impossible' in paragraph 1.
But problems remain.
Despite efforts to reduce the number of children in institutions, Save the Children Romania says that no attention is paid to combating trafficking for sexual exploitation.
The recent reported death of 17 psychiatric patients from malnutrition and hypothermia in a hospital in southern Romania shows the severe problems faced by disabled people.
Our Amendment No 3 shows that discrimination against these and other groups is magnified amongst Roma communities.
I fully support the rapporteur's view that the challenge is not simply one of closing chapters in negotiations but still one of dealing with endemic problems of corruption and political reform in order to meet the Copenhagen criteria for democracy and human rights.
Finally, I am delighted that people from my own region in the east of England are linked through a network called Praxis with the Arad County Council in Romania.
We must not lose sight of our aspiration, which is not simply about completing a political process of European enlargement but about bringing the people of Romania together with all those we represent.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the years in which we in this House busied ourselves with resolutions on the enlargement process, I sometimes found it disconcerting when we made quite detailed and precise demands of the countries concerned, imposing on them requirements with which we ourselves did not comply and telling them that this, this and that had to be utterly changed.
So I found Commissioner Verheugenâs comment on agricultural policy this morning very helpful.
Perhaps we ought really to be considering whether, if the accession countriesâ administrations cannot implement these things quite that fast, the problem might not lie with us rather than with the countries of which we demand these things.
After they have joined us, I would like to see a lot of our dead weight subjected to scrutiny, as we in Germany had to do after reunification, in order to take a look at all the red tape that had accumulated over the years and to consider whether the new Member States might not perhaps be able to provide us with more flexible and quicker solutions.
All this is by way of general comment. I am the shadow rapporteur for Hungary, which has, of course, always been the model country, the country that, as long ago as August 1989, helped to cut through the Iron Curtain, to break down the Wall.
With the pan-European picnic in August 1989, when everything was hanging in the balance, Hungary sent Europe a vital signal, and they have always done very well in fulfilling the criteria, so that they could actually be an example to the others.
I am therefore particularly amazed that the Hungarian prime minister has come up with this curious proposal that candidates should stand on a sort of Unity List, with seats shared out between the government and the opposition, and that this would be the way to enter the new Europe.
That really is an old way of thinking.
Not a few Heads of State or Government would like to have things split half and half between government and opposition; perhaps the German Chancellor would in his present situation.
The only thing is that democracy is about competition; it is about grappling with problems in order to find the right solutions, and so I wish that PÃ©ter Medgyessy, the Hungarian prime minister, would drop this idea and get back to our way of conducting parliamentary debate and, in his internal affairs policies, to competition between parties.
Â Â  â Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today is the last time that this House will be able to discuss the process by which the ten new Member States are acceding to the European Union.
There remain only 51 days before the historic date of 1 May 2004, on which the European Union will grow to become a Union of 25 Member States.
This particular enlargement of the European Union will be accomplished on Workersâ Day, a date symbolising our need to face up to the challenge of giving the Union of 25 states economic and social cohesion.
It is no less significant that, the internal policy of the enlarged Europe being a work of peace, we are developing it into a real, outward-looking common European peace policy.
I have made Cyprus my concern ever since I entered this House in 1984, a time when few thought its accession a realistic prospect.
Then, a few years later, Parliament forcefully urged that a solution to the Cyprus problem should not be made a precondition for its accession.
I well remember such former Members of this House as Mrs Pauline Green, Mr Jan Willem Bertens, and Mr Yannos Kranindiotis; we believed that the accession process would be the catalyst that would bring about unification.
There is now a substantial chance of the 30-year-long division of Cyprus being brought to an end even before 1 May.
Not merely is it to be hoped, it is also to be expected, that the negotiating parties will indeed seize this opportunity, which may well be the last for a long time, and I hope and trust that Turkey will stand by its recent indications of willingness to work towards a solution.
We must bring about a united Cyprus, in which all Cypriots can live together in peace, and which can play a full part as a Member State of the EU.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are analysing and describing the final steps on the road to the peaceful and comprehensive reordering of our continent.
Never before in the course of history has a new order been achieved without war or the use of force.
This development is thrown into particularly stark relief when we consider the road taken by those states that have been able to overcome what was called âactually-existing socialismâ and to find their way to freedom and democracy.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania deserve particular credit for having been able, along the road to freedom, to regain their independence as states.
Speaking personally, I am grateful to the people, parliament and government of Latvia, who, with the European Unionâs support, have created the conditions for solving an extremely complex problem, that being the progressive integration of a large Russian-speaking minority.
When one bears in mind that the countryâs ethnic makeup is the result, more than anything else, of decades of occupation, it was not self-evident that this would happen, nor was it so in view of constant misunderstandings and suppositions on the part of, among others, the Russian Duma.
At this point, I want to extend thanks to Mr Brok, who, this morning, gave voice to clear expectation of a change in the Russian position.
Like Estonia, Latvia has set itself a task with, in future, a European dimension.
I am convinced that the Russian-speaking minority will be successfully integrated into Latvian society, but that will depend on these citizens giving unmistakeable demonstrations of their loyalty to the Latvian state. It is also dependent upon their unconditional acceptance of the values and principles of the European Union.
Future stronger and more extensive cooperation with Russia will depend, above all, on Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania putting down deep roots in the European Union.
This cooperation is a strategic challenge for the European Union as a whole and the new Member States will have an indispensable contribution to make to it.
Â Â  â Mr President, when speaking on Estonia earlier, I praised, in their absence, its former Prime Minister Mart Laar and its Foreign Minister Ilves for their consistent policy of reform at home and, in foreign affairs, their aligning of their country with Europe.
Now the two of them are sitting here beside me, so once again, I will express my thanks and appreciation for what they have done.
As shadow rapporteur for Lithuania, I was particularly pleased by the high degree of approval â over 91% â in the referendum on accession to the EU, but also by the countryâs high level of economic growth in recent years, which alone has made it possible to raise the funding that is needed if the social problems of transformation are to be solved.
Lithuania, though, is also a very pertinent example of the continuing tensions between democratic institutions and the Mafia elements that are attempting to exert influence at the very highest levels of the state.
Where this is concerned, I have confidence in the independence of Lithuaniaâs constitutional court; I am also optimistic that the Lithuanian parliamentâs investigations with a view to removing the present President from office will produce results commensurate with the requirements of the rule of law.
It is perhaps this very point, among others, that I find lacking in Romania, and many speakers, including those who spoke this morning have already addressed this.
Perhaps not only the small-time players should be punished, but also the Mister Bigs.
In Romania, too, corruption and nepotism go right up to the very top; that is one reason why the country has fallen so far behind, while another is that too few changes of personnel were made after the political change.
The revolution was not a complete success.
The simple fact is that many of the old structures are still in place â not only at the highest level, but also at others.
If the criticism is justified, then it is equally right that we should express our support and our willingness to help, but the main thing is that the work has to be done in the country itself, and sometimes the clearing-out has to start right at the top.
Â Â  Mr President, 1 May 2004 will finally signify the end of the cold war and seal the reuniting of a continent that we failed to protect from Communist tyranny.
The EU, a body of 25 states, will soon have a population of 455Â million and be the biggest economic zone in the world, even bigger than the United States of America.
Slovakia, on which I am shadow rapporteur for my Group, has undergone huge changes over the last ten years, with the current government determined to deregulate.
For instance, it has just cut business tax, along with income tax, to a competitive flat rate of 19%; this is most worrying to its neighbour Austria, which fears that businesses will relocate over the border.
There have been similarly huge, visible changes in terms of prosperity, security, democracy, the rule of law and the fight against corruption in public life.
In particular, we observed huge improvements in human rights, including minority rights, such as for the Roma communities and the gay community.
Other matters as diverse as safety in nuclear power stations and food hygiene laws have also been implemented to the high EU standards.
Security is also improving for all our continent, as all acceding countries bar Malta and Cyprus, which I particularly welcome as British Commonwealth states, will shortly be joining Nato.
We can safely say that previous enlargements of the EU have historically been a success story.
Conservatives, on balance, welcome the process and expect a similar outcome this time.
However, we in the United Kingdom are right to bring in measures to prevent benefit tourism, whilst at the same time welcoming those seeking to work in our country.
Over the horizon, we look forward to Romanian and Bulgarian accession in 2007.
I am confident that the strong warning in the report on Romania will provide the incentive for its government to drive through the necessary reforms to satisfy all the Copenhagen criteria in time for Romania to join in due course, as scheduled.
Today's sacking of the Romanian Justice Minister is a clear demonstration of the necessary political will for that process to occur.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to thank the Members who took part in this debate.
I myself have witnessed at first hand on my visits to the accession states the quite extraordinary progress that has been made and Members have rightly drawn attention to that progress.
There is still work to be done, but a huge amount of work has already been achieved.
Parliament has addressed this issue in a most effective manner.
I wish to express my gratitude to Members for the role they have played in the very important task of communicating to the citizens of their countries the unique and extraordinarily important moment we have reached in terms of enlargement.
I agree also with what Commissioner Verheugen said this morning on the need to send out a positive message â and it is a remarkably positive message.
I cannot understand how democrats cannot see just how remarkable the moment will be on 1 May when Europe will be reunited and when the most extraordinary event will come about without the firing of a single shot, as one or two Members have said.
The presidency has full confidence in the Commission's ability to manage a smooth transition to membership of the accession states.
I have already paid a personal tribute in this regard to Commissioner Verheugen.
The Commission has the sole competence among the institutions to carry out the task of ensuring the proper functioning across all policies.
I think that is happening.
The presidency at the same time urges the newly-acceding states to complete their preparations and in particular to complete preparation in areas where problems have been identified by the Commission.
This is worth doing for the new accession states themselves and for the Union. I would encourage full attention in that regard.
With regard to Bulgaria and Romania, we had two fine reports before us today from Mr Van Orden and Baroness Nicholson.
The presidency intends, in partnership with these countries and with the Commission, to ensure the application of the fundamental principle of this enlargement process and in particular the principle that each negotiation will be based on the merits of the individual case.
The European Union will continue to monitor very closely the commitments made and the effective implementation of the in order to guide both countries in their preparation for membership.
The presidency urges both countries to continue carrying out these preparations energetically.
We are determined to do as much as possible to carry out the mandate of the European Council of December and to finish the negotiations this year.
Welcoming both countries into the Union in January 2007 remains the European Union's objective.
A number of Members specifically mentioned issues relating to Cyprus and Turkey.
Mr Poos, in particular, touched on this. At last month's General Affairs and External Relations Council ministers again expressed the clear preference of the Council for the accession of a united Cyprus.
We welcome the agreement of the parties to resume the negotiation process for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem within the framework of the Secretary-General's mission of good offices.
The Council fully supports Secretary-General Annan's efforts for the conclusion of an agreement, and we remain ready to accommodate the terms of a settlement, in line with the principles on which the Union is founded.
I hope that the parties will redouble their efforts to reach agreement in the talks that are under way, and this clearly is in the interests of all the people of Cyprus.
As we prepare for the European Union decision in relation to Turkey in December, we must also welcome the progress that Turkey has made to date in legislation for reform.
Minister Cowen highlighted the crucial importance of moving ahead with the practical implementation of reforms at all levels of the administration and throughout the country when he led the EU Troika meeting with Foreign Minister GÃŒl in Ankara on Monday last.
Minister Cowen reiterated the assurance to Minister GÃŒl that, if the European Council decides in December that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU is committed to opening negotiations.
A number of other issues were dealt with, but I want to return to one issue â the question of free movement and migration.
A number of Members made the point that there is no evidence whatsoever to support some of the more scaremongering stories that have been spread in this regard.
I welcome those particular contributions.
Certainly at this point there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that the floodgates will open as and from 1 May next.
At best, this is tabloid hysteria.
The study by the European Commission and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions shows that, even under conditions of full freedom of movement, migration from all the new Member States to all current Member States is likely to be about 1% of the working-age population of the new Member States over the next five years.
That is hardly a flood!
The study shows that typical potential migrants are young and extremely well educated â the very type of people we need in the Union.
It also shows that they are single, with no dependants, and that there is a high propensity for them to return to their native homes.
The study confirms the view of the European Commission that fears of a huge wave of migration from the new Member States after 1 May are unfounded.
I mention this point in particular because I know from the domestic debates on referenda in Ireland how easy it is for people of ill intent to misrepresent what in fact is the position.
The reality is that Europe should be a Europe that welcomes the ten accession states and that we should fully meet all our obligations to the ten states.
In conclusion, I wish to thank the Members.
It has been a very thought-provoking and thorough debate.
I know Members have put a huge amount of time and effort into what were necessarily truncated contributions. But points made have been well noted by the presidency.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs and all the speakers for a debate which has demonstrated, firstly, that we really are giving our new Members a new welcome, and secondly, that we agree on where praise and criticism are due.
I think we also agree that people in the new Member States have shown a willingness to change, a willingness to go along with far-reaching reforms that some of us might like to see in our own countries.
I am a member of the European Commission, and I have not spoken in relation to any particular country; there is a need for reform in a whole array of European countries, irrespective of who governs them.
I wish to thank the Presidency, which, in close cooperation with the Commission, is driving this process forward, and, where there are things still to be done, is doing them together with us.
Let me make just a few more comments on the discussions this morning.
I would like to say to MrÂ Titley, on the subject of anti-Semitism in Lithuania, that we picked up on the Lithuanian newspaperâs anti-Semitic outbursts at once.
It was in fact the Commission that raised this issue in the first place, and the Lithuanian Government has since responded by taking appropriate action.
To those Members of this House who have spoken on the subject of the Roma, I would like to say that this is indeed one of the great unresolved issues in Europe, but that we cannot expect the accessions to produce a solution to it.
It will take us at least a generation, if not several, before we can do away with social discrimination against the Roma, but what we did insist on as a precondition for accession was a detailed strategy that would help to overcome such discrimination in all areas.
I would like to respond to Mr SacrÃ©deusâ interesting comment on Turkey and Cyprus by pointing out that it was the Commission that made the explicit political connection between the Cyprus issue and Turkeyâs political aspirations towards Europe and declared that it was hard to imagine us being able to initiate accession negotiations with a country that did not recognise an EU Member State or had stationed troops in it in such numbers as to contravene United Nations resolutions.
It follows that Mr SacrÃ©deusâ appeal ought not to have been necessary, and that was the line we took; that was what led to the Cyprus talks happening now.
Let me conclude by returning to the subject of Romania.
It was the Romanian Government itself that attached the greatest importance to the Council recommending a date on which the accession negotiations were to be concluded this year, something on which the Commission took a different view.
Our line was that we needed more flexibility here, that this would be in Romaniaâs interests, and that it would be sufficient for us to conclude negotiations by the end of 2005 in order for accession to take place in 2007.
The Romanian Government, however â for political reasons that I can well understand â insisted on 2004 as the date, and so we are entitled to expect it to make special efforts to fulfil all the conditions by then.
I am happy to confirm what has been said by a number of speakers, that the warning shot fired by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy produced very rapid and credible responses; I have gained the impression that Romania has pulled itself together and that the process is now on the right track.
I cannot do other than encourage the Romanians to continue acting in such a decisive way, and then, I think, we may yet reach our destination.
Â Â  That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will be tomorrow at noon.
Â Â  In this joint debate on enlargement, it has once again been said that the constitutional treaty prepared by the Convention would provide a âframework to enable the enlarged Union to work effectivelyâ, and that it should be adopted as quickly as possible, even before 1 May 2004.
This is not correct.
The reality is in fact the opposite.
The draft Constitution is entirely unsuitable for an enlarged Europe for two reasons:
First of all, it maps out a State structure that is much too heavy and too rigid for a diversity of countries with very differing concerns.
In an enlarged Europe, we in fact need a streamlined and flexible cooperation structure, which allows for a variety of forms much more easily than the current draft Constitution.
Secondly, the draft Constitution provides for European institutions mainly functioning by majority, which is difficult to conceive in an enlarged Europe with no national safeguard clause.
As the accession of Turkey appears to be under serious consideration by our governments â a possibility that I personally object to â have they thought about the far-reaching consequences of the reforms that they are proposing, which risk giving Turkey a central decision-making role in a Europe with uniform rules?
Â Â  .
This report on the detailed preparation for EU membership by the 10 new Member States who will join on 1 May has once again deservedly attracted widespread support in principle in this House.
It is interesting to note that the UK Unionist Parties are so enthusiastic about EU enlargement and keen to welcome on board these new Member States, many of whom are small, like Scotland, and in many cases have recently regained their independence.
A contradictory approach is taken by these Unionist Parties at home, where Scotland is deemed, by them, to be too small, too poor and too weak to be able to exercise the normal rights and powers of independence.
It is clear that Ireland, for example, has prospered as an independent EU Member State and it is fitting that in its role as EU presidency, Ireland will preside over this, the largest ever single enlargement of the EU.
I have no doubt that Scotland too would be better off independent rather than being misrepresented and betrayed on a regular basis by UK ministers in the Council.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0110/2004), by Philip Charles Bradbourn on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending the amended proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network (renewed referral).
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please remember that back in October 2001, on the basis of the White Paper, the Commission presented to the Council and Parliament an initial proposed amendment of the Decision on the guidelines and updating of the 14 priority projects approved in 1994 by the Essen European Council.
At first reading, Parliament approved the main points of this proposed revision of the guidelines for the trans-European networks, in accordance with the compromise which had been reached.
The Commission's proposal of 1 October â which is now on the table in Parliament â for this type of âfirst second readingâ, completes that.
Meanwhile, the Council has reached a political agreement on the text which combines both proposals, which, let us remember, represent the design of the trans-European networks in an enlarged Europe, a Europe of 27 Member States.
I must say that the Commission's proposal today includes the updating of the priority projects, but also â and I would like to stress this point â of the organisational resources aimed at improving their planning, monitoring, coordination, funding and, therefore, their realisation, at European level.
Our intention in this case is that the maps showing routes should become reality within our European geography.
So what are the principal objectives of this proposal?
Firstly, I would like to point out that, on the basis of some 100 proposals presented by the States, the high-level group recommended reviewing the projects which conform to the following criteria: they are located on important European routes, they are subject to firm commitment on the part of the States in question, with a closed timetable for completion, they offer advantages in terms of aspects such as environmental protection, modal balance and territorial cohesion.
We must remember that in that high-level group, chaired by former Commissioner Karel van Miert, not only were all the States of the Union + 10 + 2 represented, but also the European Investment Bank, whose opinions in relation to the economic aspects of the projects have been very useful.
It should be noted that one of these priority projects concerns the so-called âmotorways of the seaâ, which are alternatives to the saturated land corridors and which must improve accessibility of regions which are disadvantaged by their geography, that is to say, the peripheral regions.
The main innovation is that, within the framework of the trans-European networks, it will be possible to grant subsidies for implementation under specific conditions, which represents an interesting alternative for the European transport system, but furthermore emphasise port equipment in interconnection ports and the interconnections of ports with their surrounding areas.
I must say that the aid for launching the new lines which would constitute the motorways of the sea would be restricted to what is absolutely necessary in order to guarantee the viability of economic relations between two States which jointly decide to establish one of these regular interconnections as an alternative to other modes of transport.
The complete list of priority projects â three of which have been completed â represents an investment of EUR 224Â 000 million between now and 2020.
But that is nothing more than the really essential part, the tip of the iceberg, because we must remember that the total cost of the projects for the trans-European networks for the Union of 27 States is more than 600Â 000 million.
In other words, if we were really to carry out all the projects which we consider to be of trans-European interest in order to structure European Union transport, we would be talking about an investment of more than EUR 600Â 000 million, and what we are indicating is that of that 600Â 000, the most urgent sum represents at least EUR 225Â 000 million.
I am pleased to note that the rapporteurâs report stresses the need to focus support and funding on priority projects within the project of European interest.
This initial selection effort is essential in order to clarify what is of European interest in relation to great networks and what, for example, is included in regional development.
In order to enhance the coordination between the States of the Union, the Commission proposes appointing â and now we are getting into new contributions beyond the drawing up of big routes â a European coordinator for one or several specific projects with a trans-European component.
The job of this coordinator will be to advise the promoters of the project with regard to funding and assessment and also to promote synchronised development on each side of the border in the case of trans-European projects, as well as to carry out the different administrative procedures accompanying this type of project.
It must be pointed out that, from the point of view of evaluation, we know that this will require consultations, work, not only with the States â firstly â but also, in many cases, with the regions affected and the neighbouring populations.
The Commission also proposes a procedure for declaration of European interest which will mean encouraging the States to respect the timetable for the works listed in the proposal, and to integrate the assessment procedures divided between different States.
In other words, the ultimate objective is to establish single and coordinated evaluation procedures between two States, which will enable border areas to make simultaneous progress and, where necessary, the border regions to be better coordinated.
According to the Commission's proposal, this declaration could be withdrawn if the requirements are not fulfilled, in particular with regard to the timetable for work and the progress of the process.
All the objectives I have just described are clear and achievable and we believe essential.
I would like to conclude by saying that it is still possible to adopt this proposal during this legislature â although it is true that we have very little time â and it is therefore necessary that the approach of the three institutions is based on cooperation and the will to make progress and to demonstrate a degree of flexibility.
As far as I am aware, the current differences are not really so great and I believe it is possible to reach an agreement â I would insist â before the end of this legislature.
The approval of this proposal before 1 May would be extremely important, essentially for the new States, which could thereby benefit from that date and be genuinely included in this great project we are establishing amongst all of us.
Â Â  .
Mr President, a key collective goal of the European Union has always been and will always be that of a single market.
The trans-European networks are a potent symbol of that single market, creating transport links that spread evenly the length and breadth of the EU and providing calculable benefits for business and people alike.
As Parliament's rapporteur, this is the core consideration I have used in developing this proposal.
The Community is set for enlargement in May, bringing under its umbrella another 75Â million citizens, while at the same time huge growth is predicted in our major transport networks over the next decade.
This more than ever is the right time to concentrate our efforts and bring this programme to a timely conclusion.
We have a great opportunity to tie up this decision quickly, a mere three months after Parliament first debated this revised document.
Whilst I firmly believe that Parliament can achieve most of what it wants within the body of this proposal, there clearly remain a number of issues on which we must all exercise good judgment and flexibility.
I would urge all Members to come together to successfully conclude this legislation by moving forward as quickly as possible.
Europe needs improved transport links now.
We have to remember that this piece of legislation is Member State driven, and the fact that the Member States have met and managed to agree a comprehensive list of projects has to be recognised positively, whilst not denying Parliament its rights under the codecision procedure.
There are certain areas that still need to be addressed.
In our opinion the Council's position does not go far enough in placing restrictions on state aid for some key elements.
Following the Commission's decision on Charleroi, we feel this principle should be upheld in respect of the TENs and in particular the motorways of the sea element of the programme.
You cannot pick and choose when to enforce state aid rules and cannot add state aid .
We have also discussed the time limit for funding and I am pleased that the Commissioner referred to that in her address.
I hope that both the Council and Commission will agree with Parliament on this, because in order to secure the long-term viability of the trans-European networks, it is imperative that we first ensure a commitment to act, as well as the sound management and financial probity of suitable projects.
In conclusion, the TENs programme deserves implementation.
It has at its core the achievement of a single market.
I sincerely hope we can move forward to a sensible and above all balanced approach to Europe's infrastructure needs, which after all will help determine the future shape of transport across our continent for decades to come.
I commend this report to the House.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it would have been nice if the President-in-Office of the Council could still be here to hear us discuss this but, never mind, we are used to this sort of thing.
I would like to start, Madam Vice-President, by reiterating that you have taken a very great deal of trouble in submitting a very well thought-out proposal.
Setting up the van Miert Group was a very good idea, and the Commission proposal is influenced by what it produced and you revised.
For that, many thanks; especial thanks, too, to my colleague Mr Bradbourn, whose report is the result of very careful work.
As it stands, the report is not entirely what he would have liked to see, as a fortuitous majority in the Committee pushed through very substantial amendments to Annex III, but perhaps we can sort that out tomorrow.
There are just three major points that I want to discuss.
My group is in agreement with the list of priority projects being extended to 30.
I now hear that the Council has suddenly decided that it no longer wants the 30th.
It has to decide, then, what it actually wants.
Although we are prepared to extend the list by adding, for example, the project for a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt, we want a more precise definition of the projects in some areas covered by Annex III.
This is the subject of a number of amendments, and I hope that the Council will accept them.
My group is, at present, prepared to keep the list to 30 projects, as we know that, according to Article 156(2), decisions on trans-European networks cannot be taken in opposition to the Member States, so it makes no sense to make major additions to the list in the short time available.
This means that we are taking the same line as Commissioner de Palacio, and I hope that the other groups will do likewise.
Madam Vice-President, we very much welcome the idea of motorways of the sea; I see the advancement of short-distance transport by sea, especially ferries, as very important.
As a mode of transport, it saves a great deal of energy, is highly environmentally friendly, and will tend to take the load off road and rail corridors.
However, Madam Vice-President, we are behind the rapporteur.
Motorways of the sea must not be used as an excuse to inject state funds in the form of subsidies, with the state even buying ships in order to compete with private enterprise.
That goes against the whole idea of trans-European networks, the object of which was always to improve infrastructure so that business can use it.
Using them to extend it is not acceptable.
I think we will sort things out with the Council in a sensible way, but there is very little time in which to reach an agreement.
If, by Monday evening, the Council has not precisely defined what its interests are, and thereby enabled us to agree on the details, nothing will happen by 1 May; the fact is that Parliament will not simply abandon the good positions incorporated into the Bradbourn report simply because the Council is obstinately sticking to its own.
Codecision is at issue here.
Both sides have to give way.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bradbourn, I would first of all like to welcome the ambitions of this trans-European network programme.
It is necessary for employment and growth across the continent, for solidarity between the countries of the EU, in particular the new members, and for supporting the internal market.
I will make a few comments on the text before us.
The first comment concerns the motorways of the sea, on which I take the opposite position to Mr Bradbourn and Mr Jarzembowski.
I think that they are spatial planning tools.
They are transport policy tools.
If they were only market tools, the motorways of the sea would not become a reality, because they would not be able to compete with roads and would be reduced, at best, to motorways of the sea between Antwerp, Rotterdam and Hamburg, which would be woefully insufficient for relieving the majority of European traffic.
I think that they need public support, because they are public policy tools and not just market tools.
Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the need for the European Parliament to have as much involvement as possible with the latest revisions and to be kept informed, if possible, of their implementation.
We know that Quick Start exists, not legally, but actually.
I think it would be reasonable for Parliament to be kept regularly informed, as the projects that it undertakes are implemented.
Finally, on the subject of funding, you said yourself, Commissioner, that you needed EURÂ 4.8 billion per year in order to set this particularly ambitious programme in motion.
Unfortunately, I now have the impression that we are being given the luxury of choosing a spending programme without the restriction of finding income.
I would like to say that Parliament will support you, in the Council, to help you ensure that this programme does not exist solely on paper and that it does not end up with the Essen syndrome, in other words that it is not just something that is talked about but has no future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the brief time that Parliament has accepted for debating the vote on these guidelines, as well as the strong commitment being made to reaching an agreement that will allow the work to be completed by the end of this parliamentary term is proof of the importance that Parliament too attaches to defining the European transport networks.
These are seen as tools both for constructing the internal market and for strengthening the cohesion of the Union.
They are tools that will cause a profound shake-up and readjustment of priorities in the territory of the Union and that will go on to force everyone to find their own role in building the new European area.
TENs were first defined in 1996, whereupon we found ourselves, little by little, having to look again at this project several times, changing the content too, because motorways of the sea are fundamentally a novelty that must above all be seen as a tool for allowing some traffic to be taken away from our Unionâs congested roads.
We are now faced with a dual necessity: that of strategically defining the works that will have a long-term effect and that will significantly reduce the construction time, and that of continually adapting to those economic and social changes that, in turn, alter the demand for transport.
Flexibility on two levels is therefore to be commended: flexibility over time, which should be partiallyÂ âÂ and I must say adequatelyÂ âÂ guaranteed by the concept of biennial reports that can lead to the agreed forms being revised; and flexibility in the actual definition of the group of projects corresponding to each of these proposals.
I say this because we are essentially talking about major waterways, but major waterways can only be classed as such if they have working tributaries and if proper links to these are put in place.
Well then, I will take the liberty of insisting that thought be given to the possibility of ensuring that major tributaries and the links essential for major waterways to work are placed on an equal footing, as indicated in the tabled amendments.
Â Â  Mr President, as a result of a number of bottlenecks in the trans-European transport network, the movement of persons and goods gets snarled up at the crossing with the Alps, the Pyrenees and a few sea straits.
Not only the hauliers, but also the people living in mountains, valleys and coastal resorts complain about a huge traffic burden.
Nobody took it upon themselves to build tunnels and bridges in order to remove those bottlenecks.
Furthermore, for years, rail traffic did not keep up with demand for fast connections between the big cities in different countries.
That is why we desperately need to work on maintaining, improving and extending the transport network in Europe, and in this the primary option should be for transport by rail and at sea, which are the least environmentally threatening forms of transport.
It would be narrow-minded to measure our prosperity, well-being and progress according to the rise in transport, or the surface area of asphalt and concrete for motorways and airports.
On the contrary, preventing unnecessary transport contributes to a better environment and to the well-being of people and animals.
According to my group, a sufficient level of government spending is indispensable in the provision of public services, social security and the environment.
Wasting government funds and megalomania, however, do not solve anything.
We are opposed to the idea of endless investments of Community funds in asphalt being the best way of creating and maintaining jobs or of helping new Member States along.
Neither are we taken with the intention of giving businesses overcapacity, thus enabling them to decide on every occasion which infrastructure, funded with Community support, can be used by them at the time in the most cost-effective manner.
When it was presented at the end of June last year, the Van Miert plan was immediately hailed by the Italian Transport Minister as transport's answer to the euro.
Does he see transport as an unmanageable natural phenomenon which makes people reliant on it?
We see transport as taking second place to people and the environment.
That is why we consider the Van Miert plan too unwieldy, too threatening to the environment and far too expensive.
A more selective plan, focusing on more direct and quicker rail transport is preferable.
That will be our guiding principle when we amend this proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the trans-European networks, which has been mentioned in this debate, has no future.
It does not appear to be underpinned by any real and sustainable concept of mobility for the whole of Europe; on the contrary, it is no more than yet another mixed bag of national interests.
The proposals that have been tabled are the ones that it was thought would gain acceptance.
These projects do not appear to have been analysed in terms of their benefits and optimum costs, and, in many respects, they contravene European environmental law.
One of the things that make this clear is that projects given priority status are in breach of the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive.
Among them, let me mention only the Kresna Gorge and the bridge over the Straits of Messina.
The concept of trans-European networks must be able to stand up to a strategic environmental assessment if the projects are to receive European funding.
Only projects that pass this test can be supported.
European funds must be invested in a sustainable way; they must also be capable of opening up ways ahead, enabling our children to enjoy mobility in the future.
The projects we are planning are long-term ones.
We firmly reject these misconceived plans, especially those to which I have referred.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner de Palacio, I will just focus on a few of the aspects relating to updating the priority projects, in particular on Project No 29 and more specifically on the Ionian/Adriatic intermodal rail route which, over time, has been shortened by a section that today should have instead been reopened, the Bari-Varna route.
We believe that this is an issue of great importance if it is true that the European Union and this Parliament intend to attach importance to the integration of the Balkan area into the trans-European networks too.
It cannot be said that this is not a project of European interest because it brings major added valueÂ âÂ facilitating the mobility of goods and peopleÂ âÂ and because it will contribute to territorial cohesion of the European Union.
An objection is being made to the impossibility of using the structural funds because these countries are not currently within the European Union.
This is, however, an objection that, in my opinion, can be easily overcome only if there is a will to suggest access to the EIB funds or a more prudent reworking of the funds already earmarked by the European Union for the whole Balkan area.
The Balkan area is very important, not just in terms of transport, but also in terms of security, and transport can help the issue of security, especially in an area where illegal immigration represents a constant danger for the border countries such as Italy and, in general, for the whole of the Mediterranean area.
This is why we hope that the three institutions, as the Commissioner mentioned, want to agree in the most rational way on a number of guidelines provided through the modernisation programmes listed in Annex III.
Â Â  Mr President, all those involved behind the scenes are working very hard under the guidance of the rapporteur in order to complete this dossier before the end of this mandate.
Given the importance of this matter and the amount of time that has already lapsed, time is of the essence.
In a few months' time, the number of interested parties will grow to 25, which can further delay decision-making, certainly if the project list in the annex is extended.
I am pleased that various MEPs appear to be settling for an optimisation of the projects already included.
This being the case, the only addition will be Seine-Nord, for which there is already considerable support.
What we are apprehensive about is additional obligations being imposed in respect of the environmental impact reports.
This obligation is already in place in most Member States, and duplicating it would delay the implementation of projects even further than they already have been.
It is already bad enough that the financing holds up the projects for some time.
In short, let us arrive at an agreement with the Council soon, essentially on the basis of the Commission proposals.
Â Â  â Mr President, I regret having to begin my speech with words of criticism.
The fact that the President and the Presidency have left the Chamber does not bode well for this project.
Mr Roche was present earlier while we had a very successful and positive discussion of the issue of enlargement, but now we are dealing with the technicalities of making enlargement possible, of giving it substance and life, the Presidency is not there.
For such neglect we must reproach the Irish presidency, which has otherwise been so painstaking.
Turning to the matter in hand, let me point out â as a number of speakers have already done â that we need a functioning infrastructure if the European Union, and the internal market in particular, are to function.
Nothing will work without adequate rail, road and water links.
The enlargement of the EU makes it a matter of urgent necessity that the network should be extended; to put it more precisely, what this means is establishing links or rather restoring those that Europe had, in some instances, 70 years ago, but most of which were shut down during the 70 years in which parts of Eastern Europe were under Communist rule.
We now have to expend a great deal of effort on closing these gaps.
I refer in particular to a number of links running from Austria, my home country, in relation to which I have proposed a number of minor additions, and will take this opportunity to contradict my colleague MrÂ Jarzembowski.
The majority was not fortuitous; it was deliberate and very determined, for the sake of the matter in hand, to close loopholes; we were concerned with, among other things, particularly the rail link between Graz and Spielfeld, which provides a functioning rail link with the new Member State of Slovenia, with the line from Linz to Prague and with what is known as Summerau line.
It also mattered to us that the Czech Republic should be connected via a proper and functioning rail link.
I would rejoice if, despite the resistance with which this meets, not least from my own country, we could also succeed in incorporating what is called the Southern Railway and the Semmering link into this network.
What the Vice-President stated earlier strikes me as being extremely important in the context of our present discussion and the further progress that we hope we can expect.
It is not lines on a map that we need; they have to become reality.
It is for that reason that we have to make it our concern that a start really is made on these projects, that they are brought to completion, and that funding should be provided for them.
If we succeed in this, it can be expected to have a positive effect on employment.
We would thereby be implementing some of what we constantly demand in connection with Lisbon.
Â Â  â Mr President, it would of course make for enormous fun if I were now to talk about the dispute among the Conservatives, but, as Mr Bradbourn has submitted a good report, I shall refrain from doing so.
I think we should start by stressing what a fascinating European transport project the trans-European networks are.
Jobs are at stake, as is the transport of goods, and this is also of course about how this can be done without damaging the environment.
The Commission proposal is very consistent, in that it makes clear Europeâs desire to change over to environmentally-friendly modes of transport and to water-based ones.
With the motorways of the sea, we are breaking new ground, and European transport policy can hold its head up there.
It has to be said, though, that railway projects and waterways have effects in terms of environmental policy, and so, as part of the trans-European networks, there is a need for strategic environmental assessment.
If codecision means anything at all, it means that there have to be changes in the way specific projects are developed.
If there are plans for motorways of the sea between the North Sea and the Baltic â and I think they would be a good thing â whilst the canal between the North Sea and the Baltic, which would cut the journey significantly, is forgotten, then that is not on; it would be absurd.
For that reason, there is a need for improvements here.
I think we need to tell the Council that we, in this Parliament, have had experience of the development of the trans-European networks; let me just mention the Christophersen Group or the Essen projects.
That is why it cannot be surprising that this House should attach importance to the realisation â and hence also the funding â of the trans-European networks and the priority projects being subject to strict controls and rigorous monitoring.
That I see as one of our tasks as a parliament.
If the Council wants solutions â and I think it capable of getting them â then fair compromises are needed, and they have to be agreed by us together; the Council cannot simply announce a done deal.
If it makes good use of the opportunity, we can achieve the right results.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for updating the priority trans-European transport network projects is important for Europeâs development.
I hope that it will be swiftly implemented, and for that reason it would be wise if this Parliament showed moderation in the number of projects.
The motorways of the sea is a new operational mode that I also hope will be realised with prompt decisions being taken.
It will permit the development of a sustainable and more environmentally friendly mode in a way in which logistics can be developed to the full in terms of efficiency.
I think the motorways of the sea concept should not be too limited.
These projects must also be available on existing sea routes.
With regard to the Nordic Triangle, in the vote there is a proposal to extend this to include the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia.
I support this small amendment, which, if implemented, would improve cross-border rail transport services between Finland and Sweden.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission has presented us with a new modification of the guidelines for the trans-European transport networks, in which it proposes extending the number of priority projects which will be declared to be of European interest.
We do not agree with some of them, but, above all, what we cannot accept is that, in parallel, a quick start list should be proposed to the Council, which would be restrictive, with the justification that it is necessary for the Community's growth strategy.
If we want the priority projects to be implemented between now and the end of 2006, we propose the establishment of a funding bonus for works certificates genuinely executed within this period of time.
This would really contribute to development, and not restrictive measures such as the quick start list.
We welcome the inclusion of the motorways of the sea, but we must view them as cross-border routes so that they can have access to as much Community funding as possible.
Finally, for those cases in which States have difficulties funding a certain project of European interest in time, we would request that interested autonomous communities and regions which have their own resources be permitted to present proposals to implement them, and also that these communities be able to access aid for funding trans-European transport networks included in all lines of the Community budgets.
Â Â  Mr President, I must begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Philip Charles Bradbourn, on the effort he has put into producing this report throughout its negotiation.
The projects affected, classified as priorities, which will be declared to be of Community interest, will enjoy the very significant advantage of easier access to the available Community resources.
In our case, we are glad that the modification of project No 16 in Annex III has been included, the Sines-Badajoz railway line, changing its dimension and adding certain links by road and rail which will also provide greater permeability for the Pyrenees and which are going to resolve the bottlenecks which usually arise in this area.
But it must be made clear that this permeability of the Pyrenees â and this is our opinion and our demand â must extend all the way to Algeciras itself.
We are also pleased with the support for the so-called âmotorways of the seaâ, since attaching the same importance to these transnational maritime routes as to motorways or railway is going to facilitate connections with countries isolated by natural barriers.
The benefit will undoubtedly extend also to countries with island or peripheral regions.
In line with this thinking, nevertheless, we cannot understand why, in certain passages, specific reference to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) is being removed in connections with the North Sea and the Irish Sea.
We will vote in accordance with these considerations.
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 May, a whole array of new states will be joining the European Union, but that day will not, of course, accomplish integration or the real unification of Europe; for that, many measures will be needed, in particular where infrastructure is concerned, and in the extension of the railways.
I recall how, in this Chamber, Mr Jarzembowski, we crossed swords on the subject of the Transit Regulation and how some of you â including you, my dear Mr Jarzembowski â said: âso let us invest more in railways!â
Well, we now have the chance to support not only Austria but also the countries bordering on it if, tomorrow, we vote in favour of these rail projects linking East with West, North with South, becoming reality.
I am referring here, on the one hand, to the project that has already been mentioned â from Prague to Graz via Linz and then further southwards â and also, on the other, to the southbound line through Vienna.
These will help not only our neighbours, the Czech Republic and Slovenia in particular; if we think ahead a bit, we will be including the whole of the Balkans, and if we want to free up the roads for those who have to use them or for whom it makes more sense to use them, whether with private vehicles or HGVs, then I believe this extension of the railways is what we need.
Madam Vice-President, I am very glad that a representative of the Commission, addressing the Committee during its deliberations, took a very positive view of what is known as the Summerau project, that is to say, the line running from Prague to the south via Linz.
I hope that the Commission will support these projects, for what matters is that we provide this Europe of ours with an infrastructure that is environmentally friendly, that is efficient and that really does link the countries in Central Europe with one another.
I would not wish to deny that profits may well accrue from this to Austria, which suffers a great deal from heavy goods vehicle traffic, but I do hope that we will receive support from all sides of this House; this is not about self-centred interests, but about those of Europe as a whole, and when it comes to pursuing and maintaining those, we should as far as possible be in agreement.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to describe a case for which I can find no solution: let us imagine a network, a link between two countries, backed up by all studies which tell us that in 2010 we are going to be faced with gridlock in the traffic in goods and passengers between those countries.
We are faced with the problem that one of the two countries does not support the implementation of that project.
We cannot find a solution. Something is failing, because the result will be that in 2010 the gridlock will take place and that network will not be created.
I, as an Aragonese Member, and you, as a Spaniard like myself, know that I am talking about Vignemal.
We are dealing with a project which is absolutely essential to the interrelationship between the north and south of Europe and with a country, in this case France, which seems to be withholding its interest in implementing the project.
Frankly, Commissioner, I cannot find any solution to this problem in the Commission's documents.
I hope that you, who I know offer enormous support to the project, can resolve this problem I am faced with.
Â Â  â Mr President, as representatives of Europeâs electorate and people, we have some comprehensive tasks as politicians.
First, we must ensure a good environment to live in and, second, we must ensure that there is employment, particularly for our young people in the future.
In order to achieve a good environment, employment and growth, we must make use of transport links and communications.
We must make use of the trans-European networks in a European context.
We can thus promote both growth and a good environment.
This must also take place in the peripheral northern areas where we have close trade relations with Russia, for example.
This would benefit the whole of the EU from an industrial point of view and create opportunities for employment.
We therefore propose in Amendment NoÂ 47 that the Haparandabanan line should be a priority project within the trans-European networks.
The railway is connected to those main lines that together make up an important goods route within northern Sweden and that, in turn, are connected to the Nordic Triangle, the Councilâs Project 12.
The Haparandabanan line is a missing linkIt is a mature project that involves the upgrading and new construction of railways on the Swedish side in order to raise the standard, and a rational track gauge shifting facility at the national border in Haparanda - TorneÃ¥.
The project would facilitate trade with Russia and improve the environment in the EU.
North-western Russia has great access to raw materials which should be of value to European industry and which are transported by this route.
An improvement of the rail connection can therefore be expected to contribute to a continued beneficial development of trade.
The section of the project relating to track gauge shifting facilities will provide experiences that can be drawn on also in other places in the EU that have problems with the linking of railway networks with different track gauges, for example between the Baltic countries and Central Europe and between Russia and the EU.
Finally, I would like to agree with the comments of MrÂ Savary at the beginning of the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we are at first reading, not at âsecond first readingâ, and I must say to you, as rapporteur for the report on the White Paper, that the project you are presenting to us is organised and is in line with those recommendations.
I would therefore like to congratulate and thank Mr van Miert for his work, because, naturally, the railway, the ports and maritime transport, inland waterways and roads, essentially in the enlargement countries, are quite rightly included, and we are therefore moving in the right direction.
The time has now come to respect the role of Parliament.
We cannot be convinced, as the rapporteur intended, that Parliament cannot modify this proposal.
Parliamentâs proposals are not nit-picking amendments.
I believe that the Commission must continue to play its role so that many of the extremely reasonable proposals, which I am not going to refer to, are accepted, because they contain extremely positive elements.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner de Palacio, I will use this minute to announce that our group will vote in favour of Amendments Nos 39 and 45 that provide for the bridge over the Straight of Messina to be eliminated from the projected Berlin-Palermo Corridor.
When the funding of new public works is being debated, amendments to delete things are quite rare.
In general, parliaments propose additional and supplementary features. This increases still further the political significance of the position of our group and of other groups that will vote in favour of these amendments on the grounds that the bridge is economically and environmentally unsustainable.
To link Palermo with Berlin, more than a bridge would be needed, Commissioner.
A whole railway would be required.
In Sicily, trains still run on single tracks, like in the time of King Vittorio Emmanuele.
We stress that we do not have any ideological prejudice because of this; we are simply convinced that this is a useless, unrealistic and costly project.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to thank you for all your speeches and in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, for the work he has done, which I know has been extraordinary, as well as the whole Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which has reworked the amendments and produced great European added value and very interesting proposals.
I would like to say to the honourable Members that yesterday, on the occasion of the meeting of the Council of Ministers for Transport, I said that if the Council had modified the Commissionâs initial proposed projects â even if it was a single modification, dealt with and supported by the Van Miert Group, but which had not initially been given the green light by the States â we would have to allow Parliament to act in a similar way.
In other words, to incorporate and where necessary amend the projects, provided that they had been considered by the high-level Van Miert Group, discussed by the representatives of all the States â also by the EIB and others â and furthermore given the green light by the States in question.
I also told them that it was not a question of substantially modifying Annex III nor all the projects, but of allowing Parliament its prerogatives, that is to say, the capacity to make contributions to the proposals for the trans-European networks.
In this regard, I noted the degree of flexibility on the part of the Council, a constructive flexibility, which could be interpreted as indicating, âwe have also been very respectful; it has been an exceptional case; the issue cannot now suddenly be reopenedâ.
And it is within the context of this balance that we have to operate.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that, as well as the specific modifications to specific projects, which I will refer to at the end of my speech, there are various amendments in your proposals which refer to general issues and many of them have been accepted.
In this regard, I am happy to tell you that the majority of those intended to clarify the text of the proposed Decision can be accepted by the Commission.
For example, Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11 (first part), 12 (second part), 16 and 17; others can be accepted with certain modifications of the wording such as, for example, No 10 (first and second part) and No 40, in relation to the reference to environmental analyses; it is clear that all projects funded by the Commission must respect the environmental legislation in force; that is an obligation.
The Commission therefore accepts the addition of the reference in the text aimed at emphasising this aspect, as in the case of Amendments Nos: 33, 34, 37, 42, 43 and 44.
With regard to the other amendments, some cannot be accepted because they have already been implicitly included in the proposal and are therefore superfluous; for example, Amendments Nos 11 (second part), 12 (first part), 18 and 21.
Other amendments have been rejected because they go beyond the scope of the proposed Decision; for example, Amendments Nos 2 and 13 (second part).
Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 15 do not precisely correspond to the objectives of the proposal and, therefore, it is not appropriate to accept them.
With regard to Amendment No 7, we cannot accept it in its entirety, because we do not believe we should extend the concept of âmotorways of the seaâ so far, since ultimately that would reduce the strength achieved by concentrating and selecting specific projects; nevertheless, there is one part I would like to refer to which we can accept and which relates to Amendment No 22 by Mr Jarzembowski, and that is that we could include an express reference to the fact that motorways of the sea will include canals linking two seas.
I believe that this makes sense and we can include this modification.
We should not remove the open procedure for competition, that is the announcement of proposals.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must not hand out the motorways of the sea just to people we know, because that would be entirely contrary to our approach.
What we must do is open up the contracts to competition, because that is the only way to maintain balanced systems, to gain the greatest advantages offered by the various opportunities and maintain the basic principles of the Treaties.
We must guarantee transparency and competition, and that means we must make open tenders, announcements and proposals.
The economic conditions are specified in the financial Regulation and not in this document.
With regard to the European coordinator, as I indicated previously, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 9 and 10, with certain clarifications, while Amendment No 8 cannot be accepted as such by the Commission, which does not mean that this Parliament will not be informed of the appointment of coordinators, but that the Commission will inform Parliament of the appointments as and when they are agreed.
With regard to Annex III, as I said, the Commission's view is that the debate should not be reopened but that it should maintain a degree of flexibility because, I would insist, this House co-legislates on an entirely equal footing with the Council.
The Council has reopened it and, therefore, we believe that we must provide a margin for flexibility.
Furthermore, the Council has heard the Commission's argument.
In this regard I would like to say that four amendments which contain modifications or details of routes for projects already included in Annex III, proposed by the Commission, must be accepted, provided that the countries in question accept those modifications.
Because we cannot do anything against their will.
And in reply to Mr FerrÃ¡ndez Lezaun, you have no idea how much I understand you.
Unfortunately, this is not the only case; when one is in my position one realises that this is not the only country, nor the Pyrenees the only border, where situations of, shall we say, asynchrony, or lack of coordination of times, arise, and that is bad for everybody.
We cannot therefore make modifications which are not accepted by the countries.
In this regard, yesterday we were trying to reach an agreement with the countries on the modifications of this nature they would be prepared to accept.
I have received certain replies which I will mention to you.
For example, the first part of Amendment No 22 could be accepted, that is to say, in relation to the linking of the two canals, either because we present it black on white, or because we present it in a general manner, but, in this case, the countries in question are prepared to include it.
The first part of Amendment No 20, Algeciras-Bobadilla, which is a mixed project, not as it is at the moment, when it is considered as transport; it is already included in project 19 and what we must do is include it as part of Sines-Madrid-Paris, the great cargo route and we have the green light here as well.
The second part of Amendment No 22, the Baltic Motorway of the Sea, project 21, can go as far as the North Sea; its name will be changed to âBaltic-North Sea Motorway of the Seaâ and we also have the green light from the countries in question.
In the first part of Amendment No 19, relating to project 6, that is, Lyon-Turin-Trieste-Koper-Ljubljana-Budapest, it would be a question of specifying that the railway line from Trieste to Ljubljana should pass through Divaca and that the line between Venice and Trieste should pass through south Ronchi.
The Commission has difficulties here, because the countries affected are not expressing their agreement.
We are talking about modifications which consist of establishing a route with differences of 20 km to the north or to the south, as happens for example in the case of south Ronchi.
In the rough sketch we have on our map it is not clear whether it goes a little further north or a little further south.
At the end of the day this will depend on the will of the specific country and the routes which can be defined in accordance with environmental and all other types of criteria.
Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, it is difficult for the States to accept it as it is.
And the same is the case with the proposal that the Trieste-Ljubljana route should pass through Divaca.
Slovenia says that it has difficulties accepting it.
Let me make it very clear that the Commission has no problem, but that the problem is with the countries affected themselves, and we are talking about modifications of 20Â km, of going into the details of important routes.
I would insist that the Commission has no problem but that we need the agreement of the States in question.
Certain amendments involve adding projects or sections which have already been carefully assessed by the Van Miert Group.
With regard to these, if the criteria of Article 19 are met, including the firm commitment on the part of the States to carry them out, the Commission is fully prepared to facilitate this agreement.
But only two projects have been analysed in accordance with this criterion: one is the Sena-Escalda river project, which does not appear to pose any problem, because the Council accepted it at the meeting on 5 December, and naturally if Parliament proposes it, the Commission has no problem.
And the second project is Amendment No 26, relating to the Prague-Linz link.
I know that this is very important for certain Members of Parliament.
On this line we may very possibly be given the green light by the countries in question, but I am not so sure that we will be given the green light from them for the rest of the project.
I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, not to vote for this project or, at least, only to consider the first part.
Naturally, the Commission will accept what the countries affected say in the Council, because we cannot go against their opinion.
Other amendments introduce significant modifications which have not been assessed by the Van Miert Group, such as the Marseilles-Turin railway line, referred to in Amendment No 19, and which has been rejected; the same is the case with the Haparanda line, referred to in Amendment No 47.
These projects were not initially presented by the States in question and do not fulfil all the selection criteria in Article 19, in particular, the commitment of the States of the Union to a timetable.
In accordance with the spirit of Article 156 of the Treaty, the guidelines for the projects require the approval of the State in question, and the Commission must therefore oppose these amendments.
Other amendments propose routes in third countries.
In this case, the Commission cannot include routes which cross third countries in the trans-European networks, but we are aware of the problem posed by the existence following enlargement of an enclave surrounded by Union territory.
In Compostela, in June, we will meet with the chiefs of the various pan-European corridors in order to review them, bearing in mind that two-thirds of those corridors, following enlargement to 27 States, will be within the Union and will be trans-European networks, which is what we are approving today.
In that review of the pan-European corridors we will have to deal specifically and very dynamically with those works which represent a connection of European territory via non-European territory, as in the case of certain countries of the former Yugoslavia in the Balkans region.
Ladies and gentlemen, certain amendments propose withdrawing or removing parts already integrated within the proposals of the Commission's Van Miert group and approved by the Council.
These amendments, which the Commission cannot accept, are Amendments Nos 1, 7, 20 and 25.
The projects included in Annex III, I would insist, are based on economic studies and political approval from both the Van Miert group and the Council.
Ladies and gentlemen, it has been requested that in relation to motorways of the sea there should be explicit mention of Spain and Portugal rather than saying âthe south of Europeâ; this is what Mr CamisÃ³n said.
I am going to check this but, as far as I know, it remains in the proposals.
With regard to the central crossing of Vignemal, the central crossing of the Pyrenees, I would insist that we must respect the will of the States.
We must try to encourage them, but we must respect what the Treaties say: that without the agreement of a State works cannot be carried out on their territory.
I would like to end by once again thanking the honourable Members and saying to you that, as you can see, the positions of the Commission and the Council offer a degree of flexibility in order to take up some of the proposals and contributions of this Parliament which improve the initial text and which, furthermore, respect the balance between the institutions.
I would ask Parliament to understand that this margin for flexibility exists, but that it is impossible to entirely reconsider the fundamental points and the whole range of proposals for these new trans-European networks, which we must approve urgently so that, from 1 May 2004, when we are 25 countries rather than 15, the ten new Member States are included in them, since they will be part of the Union as a whole.
I would like to thank Mr Bradbourn and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their work.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B5-0066/2004).
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Â Â  . â The presidency will be submitting an assessment of the prospects for progress in the Intergovernmental Conference to the European Council in March, as agreed at the European Council in December 2003.
However, it is not for the presidency, speaking on behalf of the Council, to express an opinion on the issues raised in the honourable Member's question.
The Council has neither discussed nor taken a view on the question of a two-speed Europe.
It is not on the agenda.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to ask you a supplementary question on behalf of Mr Nogueira and then, if you will allow me, to ask one on my own behalf.
Â Â  Mr Ortuondo, you will only be able to act as substitute for Mr Nogueira, because in accordance with the Rules of Procedure there are other Members who wish to put supplementary questions.
Please restrict yourself to speaking as a questioner.
Â Â  Mr President, I am a Member of the European Parliament and I have as much right as everybody else to speak on my own behalf.
Â Â  Please follow the Presidencyâs instructions.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have heard that the main points of divergence in the Intergovernmental Conference are the composition of the Commission â whether or not there should be one Commissioner per Member State â the Presidencies of the Council and the redefinition of the qualified majority for the adoption of decisions in the Council in accordance with a majority of States and a majority of population.
Do you not believe that representation by all States in the Commission helps greater numbers of citizens to identify with European integration, and do you not believe that positions such as that of the Spanish Government, intended to create blocking minorities on the basis of the third Nice criterion â the number of votes in the Council â may push other governments to evade restrictions and to move towards a two-, three- or more speed Europe?
Â Â  â Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, although I do not completely share the concern expressed by MrÂ Nogueira and MrÂ Ortuondo, it would be good if it could be made clear in Parliament regarding what importance should be attached to these summits held by just a few Member States.
The fact is that three countries convened at this meeting held on the eighteenth of last month and, apparently, some details concerning the Constitution were also discussed there.
Information has been openly passed around regarding these voting procedures, the weighting of votes in the Council, and the appointment of Commissioners, and it would be good if we heard from you how Ireland, as the country holding the Presidency, dealt with these issues.
Were they dealt with, did any concrete proposals to the Council emerge from this summit of the big three, and what are the future intentions with regard to this matter?
Â Â  . â As I said at the outset, the issue of a two-speed Europe is not on the agenda and I am not going to speculate on this issue.
I am aware of, and in my statement this morning made reference to, many of the other issues that are of concern in the context of the IGC.
The further supplementary question on the meeting of the three countries in Berlin is one that I responded to in a previous part-session.
I indicated that these three countries were holding discussions amongst themselves, that they were not the only countries doing so, and that these were in fact very helpful to the Irish presidency.
But the main point is that this issue of a two-speed Europe is not on the agenda in the context of our considerations in the IGC.
Â Â  . â As both the Council and the Commission have repeatedly made clear in the European Parliament, the decision of 5 June 2003 was part of a package of measures taken following the violation by the Cuban authorities last year of international human rights standards.
This took the form of the summary trial and lengthy prison sentences imposed on a large number of dissidents for exercising their right to freedom of speech and participation in public affairs, as well as the summary trial and the rapid execution of three hijackers of a ferry boat, in breach of international minimum standards for the implementation of the death penalty.
The four measures announced on 5 June 2003 were symbolic and political in nature and therefore their implementation concerns only the governments of the European Union Member States and their officials.
It does not affect the private sector or individual citizens, who are free to attend the Cuban Book Fair and indeed any other cultural event organised by the government of Cuba if they so wish.
Regarding the private opinions mentioned in the question, the Council has no comment to make on what those attending the fair may have had to say.
They have the right to express their views, even if their views are wrong.
Once again the EU calls on the Cuban authorities to release all political prisoners without delay and to resume the de facto moratorium on the death penalty.
The Council reaffirms the continuing validity of the common position as the basis of the European Union's constructive engagement with Cuba, to be pursued through political dialogue so that tangible results can be achieved, particularly in the political, economic and civil rights areas.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council and dear friend, I am not in the mood for arguing about a choice of words.
A few months ago there were certain actions by the Cuban authorities which the European Union reacted to with measures which you thought were appropriate and which I thought were disproportionate, unfair and absurd â particularly those adopted in the field of cultural cooperation.
I do not know what you want to call these measures.
You say they are not sanctions.
I would like to find another word.
I do not know if they are restrictions, reprisals, pressure, coercion, cultural blockade â as the Cubans themselves say.
I would like you to tell us what word we should use so that we can really receive an answer to what we are asking.
Apart from that question, I would reiterate the question which I have put: do you believe that the measures adopted in the field of cultural cooperation help or harm Cubans and Europeans?
And, secondly, does the President-in-Office of the Council believe that the conduct of our civil society, participating en masse in activities which have been, if not boycotted, at least hindered by the European Union, is a way for civil society to raise doubts about the Unionâs policy with regard to Cuba?
Â Â  . â The words I used were very specific.
As I mentioned, the measures were symbolic and political in their nature and therefore the implementation concerns only governments and EU Member States.
They do not have a direct implication so far as individual citizens are concerned.
I also make the point that the measures which were announced on 5 June were taken only after the most careful deliberations.
It was the Council's considered view at that time that the application of the measures represented a balance between maintaining the willingness to engage in political dialogue to allow for tangible results, and the necessity to make it clear that grave human rights violations such as those that have occurred in Cuba in the last 12 months were not acceptable.
I am sure that Mr MartÃ­nez would accept that is the position.
Finally on a general issue regarding the EU and Cuba: the measures adopted by the Council were very carefully calibrated.
Some people might say that they are very mild, but the are proportionate in response to specific circumstances.
The European Union values this relationship with Cuba and hopes that those relations can be improved.
It is mutually beneficial to aim for an improvement in that regard.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I will naturally not be supporting the executions carried out by the Cuban Government.
But I must point out that there are many executions in the United States and also many selective assassinations in Israel. They are happening on a daily basis.
I would like to ask in this regard whether the Council is going to adopt any measure with regard to the agreements with these two countries I have mentioned.
Â Â  . â The supplementary question goes rather beyond the question from Mr MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez.
If Mr Ortuondo Larrea wants to table a question on a specific issue he may have in mind, I will answer it.
Â Â  I have something I would like to say to the Council.
I have just returned from Cuba, where I was able to observe the situation on the ground with an open mind, and a visit to the island might not be a bad idea for some in view of the way in which violations of human rights are discussed in this House.
As a result of our policy towards that country, we are overlooking a real treasure.
Whatever might be said about Cuba, the country has a great deal to offer; we can learn a lot from it, certainly in the field of actions for the benefit of specific target groups in selected neighbourhoods.
Moreover, it is regrettable that Europe's attitude means that many European NGOs are now having a very difficult time over there.
They would like Europe to restore and improve relations with Cuba and look at that country from a different perspective without being influenced by third parties.
There are many rumours about Cuba and, compared to other countries, we look at that country with different eyes.
Without going into specifics, I could list other countries where the death penalty is still in place.
In short, there are lots of exciting things happening in Cuba, and it would be useful to visit that country and take a dispassionate look at it.
Â Â  . â I am sure that everything the Member has said is quite correct.
I am sure Cuba is an intriguing and interesting country.
The diplomatic measures announced on 5Â June were intended to send a signal to the Cuban authorities that the new and grave violations of human rights simply were not acceptable.
The measures were not designed to isolate Cuba in any way.
On the contrary, in reconfirming the validity of the common position on Cuba on 21Â JulyÂ 2003, the Council stressed that political dialogue should be continued with a view to producing tangible results, particularly in the political, economic and rights spheres.
The Council remains very much open to political dialogue.
With regard to the point made about the impact, the Cuban Government is aware that the Council acknowledges its significant achievements in the field of social rights such as health and education.
However, it remains our earnest hope that the Cuban authorities will come to realise the necessity to make similar advances in the field of fundamental civil, political and human rights.
The same level of achievement in those areas as in the areas mentioned by the honourable Member would be very welcome.
Â Â  . â The Council does not have any specific information regarding the issues raised in Question H-0075/04 regarding the transfer of passenger data to NASA by Northwest Airlines, and is thus not really in a position to answer fully the questions raised by the honourable Member.
The Council understands that the honourable Member has also referred his question directly to the Commission, which is the competent body in relation to most of the issues.
However, I would say that detailed enquiries of this kind come within the competences of the data protection authorities in the various Member States.
