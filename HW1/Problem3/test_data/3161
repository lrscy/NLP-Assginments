In the PPE-DE Group, our main concern is that after the great success of the enlargement of the Schengen area, fatigue will now set in and many Member States will slip into a state of inertia.
That is something we cannot afford.
We need SIS II as a major project for next year.
In the legislative sphere, I would like to touch upon the border security issue again in particular.
Here, we must consider whether in future the evaluation of external border protection should no longer be carried out by Schengen members' own evaluation teams but by the Frontex agency.
That is where this responsibility should lie.
I would ask the Commission to be brave and, on the proposals regarding migration, to actually define a European added value.
If a proposal is submitted for a Blue Card for highly skilled workers, this should not just be a proposal that endorses national rules and applies a common label: it really has to be a European proposal.
The same applies to combating terrorism.
If a system for the transmission of air passenger records is established, we cannot have 27 individual rules, which we could bring in straight away; we really need a European proposal.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot go along with a lot of what President Barroso has said, especially when he says that the Commission is being tough on illegal immigration but very generous and supportive on integration.
We can certainly agree to the directive on penalising employers who illegally employ non-Community migrant workers, but we find no trace in the programme of those legislative measures on legal migration previously announced by Vice-President Frattini.
No mention is made of the Directives on seasonal workers and highly skilled workers, nor of opening up legal migration channels for unskilled non-Community workers, who constitute the majority of immigrants now present on EU soil.
We believe these measures to be necessary, not least so as to combat exploitation and bring undeclared work out into the open.
The reference to a shared overall approach is fine, and one cannot fail to agree on the need to avoid having 27 different immigration policies, but we look forward to receiving some more tangible information about the European surveillance system announced in the programme.
Finally, Mr President, I would recall that under the new Lisbon Treaty many of these subjects will be handled through codecision as of 1 January 2009, with this House assuming full legislative responsibility alongside the Council and the Commission.
It might perhaps be useful to prepare the ground for better cooperation among the EU institutions.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, one point I wanted to make was very similar to what Mr Fava has just said about the absence of any major emphasis on the need for an EU policy on legal migration.
We have had the proposals from Commissioner Frattini - and all credit to him - but we need great pressure to be put on Member States to respond to those proposals because the challenge of getting a comprehensive and well managed legal migration system for the EU should be up there with the challenge of climate change.
It links into so many other issues, economic and social.
We should be having a summit of Prime Ministers to look at not only EU competence but also exchanges of best practice on management of migration as well as integration.
I must confess I have my doubts about the emphasis that is put by the Commission on the benefits of circular migration.
I wonder whether that is going to come unstuck in the same way that our experience with Gastarbeiter did many years ago.
I am not sure that it is going to work out.
Human beings do not necessarily leave when they envisaged that they would leave.
My last point is to raise data protection concerns about the envisaged entry-exit scheme and the electronic travel authorisation.
I do not know what electronic travel authorisation will add to the visa information system, and I look forward to hearing a great deal more from Commissioner Frattini about these schemes.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements in which 12 new countries acceded to the Union are now behind us.
It is now time to focus on the integration of all the citizens of the 27 countries and to set a common course and common challenges for Europe.
One of the points in the Commission's programme is to put the citizens first.
With that in mind, future enlargements should be approached with caution and due consideration.
Enlargements opposed by the citizens should be avoided. I have in mind Turkey.
As Mr Barroso pointed out, we lack a common immigration policy.
I trust that the principle adopted will involve controlled immigration, carefully selected, as in the United States.
After all, immigration is not simply a response to particular circumstances affecting the labour market or pensions.
It involves people with whom we will have to coexist for centuries.
We should select individuals who will find integrating into European civilisation a pleasure rather than an imposition.
- (EL) Mr President, Europe benefits from its immigrants, but in today's Europe xenophobia is increasing rather than diminishing.
The example of Italy is fresh in our minds.
In my country, Greece, an EP delegation recently saw for themselves the wretched conditions in which hundreds of immigrants and asylum seekers are detained on the island of Samos.
This was in a detention centre which Ministers promised would be closed immediately, but which is still open, despite a report by an international NGO condemning it for torturing illegal immigrants.
Unfortunately, in the present dangerous climate, instead of promoting the positive aspects of immigration, the Commission is responding to a climate of fear artfully created in certain sectors.
The problem you have presented us with focuses mainly on policing, and this is somewhat biased.
It is necessary, of course, to combat illegal immigration.
There is a need for solidarity with countries receiving huge influxes of immigrants.
Proper agreements on readmission at European level and the common European protection of immigrants' fundamental rights are needed.
Immigrants cannot be sent back into danger and destitution.
Europe needs a serious foreign and economic policy to combat the main causes of migration, such as poverty and war, through peaceful yet tough measures.
Above all, of course, a multilateral policy is needed to integrate migrants into our societies.
Instead of this, your programme equates immigration with criminality.
Commissioners, you are specifically stating that the European border control system, a programme that is integrated into the framework of immigration policies, will increase the internal security of the Schengen area by preventing illegal immigration, terrorism, etc. What does security have to do with immigration, or indeed with illegal immigration?
What does it have to do with terrorism?
By associating these bogeys with immigration in the public imagination and in Europe's policies, I fear you are playing the game of the EU's far-right forces.
Please eliminate these dangerous attitudes from your strategy documents.
There are undoubtedly criminal immigrants, just as there are English, German and Greek criminals, but the immigrants' only real crime is that they were born in poor or war-torn regions.
Putting the citizens first
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, from the point of view of budgetary control, the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008 is a disappointment because key issues and problems relating to budgetary control simply do not feature in the programme.
It could be argued that this is about current management, but our concern is this: if we look at the past few years of 'current management', it is clear that in order to solve the problems, the Commission really should have adopted an agenda which went beyond current management.
We are unlikely to make any progress on the statement of assurance, although the Commission should be bringing substantial pressure to bear on the Member States here.
You have our support on this issue, yet we do not see you doing this.
As a result, you are very likely to fall short of your own commitments: commitments which the Commission President himself undertook personally on behalf of this Commission.
He pledged to move forward towards a positive statement of assurance.
We are at least as far from achieving this now as in all the years before, as we have known since yesterday evening.
When it comes to implementing the commitments, what we believe is lacking is a serious approach.
The same applies, incidentally, to the Commission's legislative programme itself.
You should be world champions in practical implementation, not in planning!
Of the 200 items for codification announced for 2007, just 23 have actually been submitted to Parliament to date, and only six of the 43 announced new items have been tabled so far.
The question which arises is this: why are we even talking about this programme if you will not be putting it into practice?
You really need to do better in 2008.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to express my thanks to the Commission.
A work programme is not just a declaration of principles, but a tool to implement specific policies.
The humblest bid to implement, however, can be a gem, and I feel the real gems in this work programme are initiatives that place the European citizens centre stage: initiatives concerning, for example, patient safety, quality of health services or reconciliation of family and professional life, as Mr Barroso said in his speech here.
We would have liked to have had this in writing in the same detail as part of the work programme.
Perhaps the greatest gem of all, though, is the proposal for a directive to combat discrimination in all the Member States.
We need this directive in this Year of Equal Opportunities for All because it must show that discrimination is not just a social, moral and political error, but also a waste of human resources.
The Reform Treaty states that the EU must encourage not only social cohesion but also non-discrimination.
Consequently, the right directives are needed because all European countries must have the same levels of protection against discrimination.
There cannot be a discrimination hierarchy.
A Europe that tolerates any kind of discrimination cannot purport to be an example to anyone.
I do have one problem here, however, and that is the role of the European Parliament in this issue.
All we have is its opinion, and it is rather ironic that we are encouraging equality here yet when it comes to institutions all of them are equal but some are more equal than others.
I also regret that the introduction to this work programme makes little mention of, or reference to, discrimination against, and integration of, immigrants.
We call on the Commission to keep the promise it made to this House that EU action will cover all areas of discrimination.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr Barroso's slogan is 'delivering results for Europe', but these results must also be in the area of intangible business, not only in the market.
Mr Barroso's Commission was to become the champion of citizens' freedoms and rights.
That has been very disappointing up until now, but with less than two years to go perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel.
As far as I am concerned, the highlight of the 2008 work programme is the proposal for a directive on equality outside the workplace, that is, a general prohibition of discrimination.
At last the Commission is listening to what Parliament has been calling for over the last number of years.
Priority must be given to this matter.
However, the Commission must guarantee better compliance with the existing legislation because there is a discrepancy between the excellent anti-discrimination laws we already have and the Commission's inability to actually enforce them.
The anti-discrimination principle must also be introduced in other areas, such as inheritance taxes and wills, and the Commission must recognise modern family set-ups in this respect.
I also welcome the proposals to reinforce equality between men and women, for example by reconciling work and family life.
As regards the position of women in the labour market, the proposals for more flexibility are important.
Flexibility is, as it happens, good for women. Rigid rules for the protection of employees put women at a disadvantage.
Intercultural dialogue has been highlighted as a priority.
The intention is to get rid of social tensions by means of dialogue, but in reality this is often inter-religious dialogue and I therefore object to it, Commissioner.
There is nothing concrete in the proposals for the coming year, and it is therefore not clear what the intercultural dialogue will be, but I fear that it might be the annual photograph of Mr Barroso with the generally conservative ecclesiastical leaders.
I would like the agenda of these ...
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the following issues.
First, as regards the multiannual strategy to establish an area of freedom security and justice: the draft Reform Treaty foresees the respect for the rights of persons belonging to minorities.
I believe that now we really need a common European policy on minority rights and social inclusion - the recent events in Italy demonstrated this clearly.
Speaking about putting the citizens first, I am sure that we have to return again to the concept of civic citizenship, which includes all permanent residents of the EU.
Mr Frattini, the Commission should take a stand on this.
As regards multilingualism, European policies to promote language diversity must take into account that not only official languages exist but also regional and minority languages.
These languages should benefit from multilingualism policies also.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a kind of irony in the Commission claiming that it wants to put the citizen at the centre of the European project in its 2008 legislative programme.
It is true that the citizen, the poor lowly citizen, has never before been central to the concerns of the Brussels-Frankfurt-Luxembourg triangle, where practically all the powers will be concentrated from now on, in other words in the hands of institutions that do not even respect the fundamental principles of democracy.
How, therefore, can we claim that we are promoting the welfare of our citizens in the era of globalisation when in fact we are in the process of abandoning the principle of the republic, which is government of the people, by the people, for the people?
Caring for the citizen means respecting what he has to say.
In this regard, the Lisbon Treaty is an insult to the people of our nations, because it is just a copy and paste job of the European Constitution that was overwhelmingly rejected and because it confirms the logic of the current Treaties that prohibit us from controlling the euro, from safeguarding our markets, from protecting our borders from illegal immigration and from defending ourselves in international trade negotiations.
In particular - and these remarks are intended especially for my French colleagues in all the parliamentary groups - this Lisbon Treaty does not change the dogmatic concept of competition without balances, without national interests, without frontiers and without any concern for democracy.
Its Charter of Fundamental Rights, which takes precedence over the rights of individual Member States, sweeps away the notion of the Citizen of the Republic as laid down in our Constitution and replaces it with the most dangerous form of multiculturalism.
As for the Citizen of Europe, no one has ever met him: in fact he does not exist.
To conclude, therefore, if anyone here is concerned about the citizen let them start by demanding a general referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the perspective of the PPE-DE Group in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to make the following three points.
Firstly, we very much welcome the fact that the European Commission has included a proposal for a European Company Statute in its legislative programme for next year.
This is something which this House has wanted for a very long time, and so it is very welcome indeed.
What we find regrettable is that the Commission has, in effect, been forced into this course of action after we made use of the legal instrument of Article 192 and opted to present a legislative own-initiative report, despite the fact that the Commission has been aware of this problem for a very long time.
Indeed, it has been mentioned repeatedly in a whole series of company law programmes ever since the days of Commissioner Bolkestein.
Secondly, we find it most regrettable that this year, the Commission suspended the process for the adoption of the Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of limited companies.
This is indeed a major problem.
We expect the Commission to reconsider and include it in future legislative programmes.
If this does not happen, may I make it clear here and now that we will again make use of Article 192 and force the Commission to bring forward a relevant legislative proposal.
The Commissioner's notions that for the application of the Merger Directive, it would first be necessary to set up a company in another country in order to merge with it are bureaucratic and absurd.
This is not a solution that we regard as acceptable.
With a view to the next legislative term, at least, we would also like to see the Commission giving some thought to achieving progress in relation to copyright and perhaps commissioning a Green Paper on this issue.
(ES) Mr President, we are obviously extremely pleased that citizens are at the forefront of the European project, but I must point out that one of the EU's major problems is the general public's vast lack of knowledge of what the Union is.
I think any of us who give talks, teach or speak on the subject witness this phenomenon.
Only the other day the media in my country referred to your colleague Mrs Ferrero-Waldner as the Swiss Commissioner.
Having said this, what we need, year after year, is a specific and broad awareness campaign to bring the European project closer to citizens and to gradually raise awareness of the institutions and how they operate.
I would also ask the Commission for a more accurate definition and smoother communication with this House and the Committee on Culture and Education in relation to the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008, since the website clearly has some major limitations.
Europe as a world partner
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, it is true that 2008 will be an important year, as the President of the Commission said, but it will be a year of transition prior to the end of this Commission's mandate.
I think if we can draw one conclusion, it is that the DurÃ£o Barroso Commission, notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which it was forced to handle EU affairs, was clearly equal to the task, both internally - the work programme - and in terms of its external image.
In my capacity as group coordinator in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am worried about a number of future international events such as the election of the next President of the United States and the repercussions of this on conflicts in central Asia, talks with a new Russian President, development of the Neighbourhood Policy and accession negotiations, assistance in the event of a statute for Kosovo, the result of the Annapolis Conference in the Middle East, the elections we all wish to see in Pakistan, the Olympic Games in China after the Communist Party Congress and the next EU-Latin America Summit in Peru.
However, Madam Vice-President, please ask the President of the Commission to reiterate our praise of the Commissioners responsible for external relations.
I see that only Mr Rehn is here today and I also wish to extend my congratulations to Mr Mandelson, Mr Michel and, of course, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
The most important thing here is for the EU's external action to be visible and effective, and I would ask you, Madam Vice-President, to exercise extreme caution when applying the provisions of the new Treaty so as not to compromise EU achievements and successes in foreign policy.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, most EU citizens agree that the Union must play a larger role on the world stage.
The Council should play a larger role in this regard, but it is often paralysed or inefficient as a result of internal disagreements.
The Commission will hopefully set a good example this coming year, starting in Europe.
In Turkey the negotiations must proceed smoothly and care must be taken to see that they stay on the right track.
There is much work to do in the Balkans: Bosnia needs help to start forming a state and Macedonia needs to prepare for the start of membership negotiations.
In addition, of course, the European Union will hopefully make an important contribution to the rebuilding of Kosovo and with any luck by the end of this year or some time next year a solution will have been found to the question of its status.
We very much want the Commission, however, to continue with the Black Sea initiative it has undertaken.
It is very important for the European Union to strive for regional cooperation around its borders.
What will the Commission do in terms of the Central Asia strategy that was recently approved by the European Council?
In this respect, I also wish to ask if we may expect further development of the energy policy that Parliament requested earlier this year.
This is very important, including with regard to relations with the region I called 'zonet'.
Then there is the European Neighbourhood Policy.
I think that the priority this coming year must be to conclude the negotiations with Ukraine: in this respect we hope - and Parliament will discuss this tomorrow afternoon - that a situation can be created in that country that will allow, over the coming years, for a new type of agreement, a form of association, under which Ukraine can continue the reform process with the new government towards further integration with the European Union.
In that process Moldova must not be forgotten either, as it is in need of a new partnership agreement.
I hope that the Commission will also present proposals on that issue next year.
Naturally we must also look at how to handle a country like Georgia: this is something we will also debate tomorrow afternoon and we would ask the Commission to be proactive in this regard.
Finally, there has been very little progress with Russia so what can we do to move things forward?
We would suggest renewed action after the presidential elections.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to my regret I have to say that I am disappointed with the section of your legislative and work programme on Europe as a world player.
There is of course little legislation in the field of external relations, as we all know, but there is all the more work to be done for that and I find that what has been written on the subject, with a couple of exceptions, is in fact grossly inadequate.
There is obviously also difficulty in clearly identifying Europe's fundamental problem when it comes to foreign policy.
The text glibly states that Europe is a world leader in the fight against poverty, the promotion of sustainable development, human rights and governance, and so on and so forth.
That may well be, but it is not perceived as such by the rest of the world, certainly not by the EU Member States, and I hear very many complaints that it is not so.
What is true, however, is that the European Union is the largest provider of all these things that are listed.
Reflecting this in our image as a world leader, as a body that takes the lead on the global stage, is something else entirely.
I am encouraged by the positive direction of the programme's proposals concerning Africa.
I feel, for example, that the proposal to establish trilateral discussions between the EU, Africa and China is particularly hopeful and positive.
I also think that the proposals to make greater efforts to promote economic development in Africa is just as important.
We are thus moving in the right direction, although there are still not enough specific goals.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the year 2008 will differ from the current year in that it will not bring a further enlargement of the Union.
The coming year will, however, provide an opportunity to develop economic and political relations between the Union and a number of important countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and also for instance in the South Caucasus, as previous speakers have already mentioned.
We must keep two Union priorities in mind.
Firstly, participation in peaceful stabilisation, notably in the Middle East and South Asia.
Secondly, exerting pressure on all our partners to ensure that the development of our bilateral relations in the areas of economics and politics is linked to respect for human rights.
This applies to each and every one of our partners, regardless of whether the particular country concerned is a poor African or Asian one, powerful Russia or fast-developing China.
These two areas, the political and economic on the one hand and human rights on the other, cannot be torn asunder and dealt with separately.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, 'Europe as a world partner' is a very nice heading for the Commission programme, but what we are really talking about is the European Union, not Europe, and it is presumptuous to use this heading at all, for Europe is far greater than just the European Union.
The EU wishes to present itself as a world partner, and the Commission's programme is very honest about this: it talks about a foreign policy to project, promote and protect - and therefore assert - Europe's interests and values successfully.
How is that supposed to happen?
The answer, increasingly, is by using military means!
The European Union is now a military actor all over the world.
On paper, this is to provide assistance to people, but in practice, EU interests, or the interests of EU Member States, are being asserted by military means.
Congo is a good example.
The EU's military intervention there has ensured that Joseph Kabila, an autocrat who is acceptable to the EU, is now in power, backed by elections, and his opponent has been forced into exile.
A brutal war has erupted in Eastern Congo, with some 350 000 people forced to flee their homes.
The EU's military intervention in Chad, too, has primarily served to bolster the position of military ruler Idriss DÃ©by, an old friend of France.
This type of EU military operation is simply a continuation of Member States' neo-colonial policies.
It seems that it is difficult to voice unadorned criticism of political friends.
Pakistan is a case in point at present.
The basis for all of this is the Reform Treaty, which makes a clearly militarised EU policy possible.
The next issue is Kosovo, and we are seeing what can happen there. Individual Member States have already announced that they intend to recognise Kosovo on a unilateral basis.
I urge the Commission to reject such measures unequivocally and not to condone any unilateral recognition of Kosovo.
Mr President, at the risk of upsetting Commissioner Dimas again, I will repeat some of the words I said last night.
Only legislate, Commission, please, where it is needed in the new work programme.
Enforce the regulations that we already have in place and enforce them right across the European Union.
Do not bring in policies which actually discriminate against industry, business, opportunities within the European Union.
Commissioner Barroso mentioned something very close to my heart on the Committee on International Trade, and that is trade defence instruments.
Use them where it is necessary to protect the health and safety of consumers in the European Union but do not use them as a protectionist measure.
We live in, as he quite rightly said, a global economy, and I look forward to seeing that.
With regard to Commissioner Mandelson, I wish him well in the WTO Doha Agreement and I hope that we can move agriculture forward with the US and the European Union to ensure we get a settlement, building on things like Euromed, which are very important to the European Union.
We have agreements with Morocco and we must look at these sort of situations.
The US has just put in a free trade agreement on that.
Finally on EPAs: just over a month ago, Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson was standing strong on his commitment to conclude EPA negotiations by December.
Let us hope that he has relaxed his position and will move forward on that.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the context and constraints affecting the Commission in the field of foreign policy, and so we are grateful for the efforts it has made, for example, to ensure that aid continues to reach the Palestinian people after the dramatic turn taken by events following the legislative elections.
On this subject, we would suggest to the Commission that it prepare as of now for possible future scenarios, whether the Annapolis conference is a success - as we hope it will be - or a failure.
On the neighbourhood policy, as has already been said, we would quite frankly have expected more than the brief progress report given in the text of the programme.
A debate has begun on the future of our Mediterranean policy - I do not know whether President Sarkozy will choose to broach this topic in his speech today - and the Commission should without doubt undertake a more detailed assessment of these policies.
It should also make proposals for the future, involving this House rather more than it has done in the past, given that tomorrow we are to discuss Parliament's report on the neighbourhood policy.
Furthermore, we would urge greater consistency between internal EU policies - such as agriculture, fisheries, trade and immigration - and our development cooperation policies with the poorest countries, especially in Africa.
Finally, the reference to Latin America strikes us as very weak.
We would honestly expect relations between the European Union and this major continent to feature more prominently on Europe's agenda, given that Latin America is so crucial to decisions on the environment as well as to other policies such as trade and energy.
Those, then, are the main points I wished to highlight on behalf of my Group.
(NL) Mr President, I am speaking here as our group coordinator in the Committee on Development.
It will therefore not surprise you that I wish to congratulate the Commission on emphasising prosperity, solidarity, security, freedom and strengthening Europe in the world.
All these things are directly relevant to the situation in poor countries.
Poverty, war and instability in developing countries have a direct impact on our continent.
Showing solidarity and support for poor countries is not only in the interest of these countries but in the interest of Europe itself.
It is only by cooperating with poor countries that adequate solutions to problems such as migration, energy and climate change can be found.
Indeed, as the Commissioner says, a comprehensive and coherent approach is needed at once.
Mr President, it is precisely in this context that it is so important for Europe and Africa to work together towards a joint EU-Africa strategy for Africa's development.
This will be defined at the Africa summit in Lisbon in December.
I hope that it will be a good example of a new way of cooperating.
As regards the effectiveness of our policy, I firmly believe in the importance of quality control and impact assessment, and the need to cut red tape.
I hope that in this way Parliament and the Commission can work well together and that the Commission will therefore keep us apprised of the situation in a regular and timely fashion, as indeed it should.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should first like to express my thanks to all of you for your comments, whether detailed or general, whether critical or supportive of the Commission's proposal for the work programme for next year.
The scope of this discussion illustrates also the scope of all the tasks and missions and activities of the European institutions.
It ranges from comments on fisheries policy or fishing agreements with Tanzania to the peace process in the Middle East - the whole range of activities that we are engaged in.
I think also that this debate underlines that the overall objectives that the Barroso Commission has set itself remain valid and urgent.
It has to do with prosperity, security, solidarity and - in everything we do - the role of the European Union on the global scene.
This also came out very clearly in the last statements.
I have now followed this procedure and engaged with the European Parliament, in the committees and also here in plenary.
I think we can say that the way this procedure has improved has also improved the quality of our proposal for a new legislative and work programme.
I appreciate also that all my fellow Commissioners have visited their committees; I think that we have appreciated this highly in some of the details that we have been able to add or change in this process.
I hope that we can continue to make it even more political, and your comments have shown that we are here to discuss the political content and the overall balance.
It also comes out clearly that the various political groups might have different views on this overall balance.
I would like to comment on the content in relation to four or five particular issues.
First of all these issues come back almost every week on the agenda of the European Commission.
To start with the Lisbon Process and the growth in jobs: I think, for the first time, we are getting very visible results.
It is not correct to say that this is a total failure and that we cannot see improvements.
We have created a clearer focus for the Lisbon Agenda.
We have created more of a political ownership and we have a kind of scoreboard where we make country-specific recommendations - positive or negative comments on what each and every Member State does.
This continues to be the way forward: more focus, more political ownership, higher visibility of the actions.
This is a long-term goal, a long-term objective of the European Union, but we have to continue to put pressure on Member States to deliver.
Another area concerns social issues and the social agenda which, judging by their comments, is of concern especially to the PSE Group in Parliament.
Here, we also had some specific questions on services of general interest.
The Commission has long recognised the importance of services of general interest and we have had years of debate on this particular issue.
We are very pleased that the Treaty of Lisbon and the Protocol on services of general interest have been agreed.
Next week, and as part of our review of the internal market, the Commission will adopt a communication outlining how we will deal with services of general interest.
I hope that Parliament will study our communication very seriously, together with its accompanying documents explaining how and when state aid rules apply to these services of general interest, and also how public procurement rules apply.
Let me be clear in saying that the Commission does not want to close the debate.
It wants the debate to focus on the problems at stake so that we can also concentrate our efforts on providing concrete solutions.
So this discussion will continue and we hope for the contribution of Parliament in this debate.
The other big issue where I thank you for your detailed comments has to do with energy.
(The President interrupted the speaker to call for quiet in the Chamber.)
I will not be able to go into all the details that have been mentioned in this debate; I am sure that the dialogue will continue in the relevant committees and the European Parliament as well.
Just to repeat what is in our proposal: in the energy package are four different initiatives.
You have touched upon that because it is a policy paper concentrating on the internal energy market, on security of supply and technological developments.
There will be a revision of the Oil Stocks Directive. There will be a complete review of the Directive on the energy performance of buildings; this was a particular question during this debate.
There will also be a review of the Energy Taxation Directive, as taxation can be used to favour environmentally-friendly consumption.
The next issue that we find constantly at the top of our political agenda, not only in the European Commission but I am sure also in this House and in all governments around Europe, is of course migration.
President Barroso explained very clearly how we address this issue.
I can assure you that almost every week, thanks to our colleague Mr Frattini, we find this issue on the Commission's agenda, with discussions on stream and proposals on stream to address the issue of migration.
You know that the policy on legal migration will not be represented next year because we have already adopted a number of proposals on legal migration, so this is not the main focus for next year.
However, there will be two priority initiatives in 2008: there will be a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers and there will also be a directive on the entry, the temporary stay and residence of intracorporate transfers and remunerated trainees.
That is what you can expect in this particular area.
On the principal position of the Commission on these issues, I would just refer you to what President Barroso said in the debate.
Therefore, you will find that these issues remain at the top of our agenda for next year.
On the external front - because you also mentioned the whole range of external issues and the activities and events where the European Union is expected to participate and play an important role - we have three strategic initiatives for next year.
We have a strategy paper on enlargement; we have a series of reports on the progress made in the European Neighbourhood Policy - since many of you mentioned that - and we also have a communication on concrete follow-up measures to the EU-Africa strategy.
Therefore, we will have ample opportunities to discuss the external issues during next year.
I can tell you, since this is the second Commission mandate on my part, that I see much more focus - and this has been mentioned in the debate - on implementation.
We have a daily struggle to make sure that we focus on implementation, and a legal act is only as good as its implementation.
This is where we will continue to focus.
I can also tell you that it is not true that we are not reaching out.
If we look at the latest Eurobarometer figures, they have never been so positive towards the concrete results that we have been able to deliver.
When the debate in the European Parliament and the concrete delivery become visible and the results become visible to the citizens, that is when we will also see our democratic legitimacy increased, and that is what we have to focus on.
We will also add a citizens' summary to our proposals for next year.
Before the end of this year we will present a new internet strategy, since some of you have asked for this.
At the beginning of next year we will also come with a new audiovisual strategy.
It is important that we focus together on a number of communication priorities, and you will see proposals for interinstitutional communication priorities in our work programme.
Finally, next year is the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which will be launched under the Slovenian Presidency at the beginning of January.
There will be a prelaunch in December, with participation from the European Parliament, and we expect the active involvement of the European Parliament throughout the year.
I thank you again for this debate.
If some issues about which you feel strongly are missing from the legislative and work programme, that does not mean that they have been put aside: the Commission will continue to provide monthly planning updates, including initiatives that have not been highlighted or initiatives which become necessary to respond to unforeseen events.
The dialogue between you, in the European Parliament, and the Commission does not stop today: we will continue working together in the positive spirit that has characterised this whole exercise and procedure and our shared ambition expressed in the work programme.
I see that we diverge less than we converge and that we have a similar view on the overall objectives and priorities for the year 2008.
I also hope that your motion for a resolution will endorse it and we will provide an excellent basis for continued cooperation.
(Applause)
I thank colleagues for their contributions to the debate, the College of Commissioners for their presence and especially Mrs WallstrÃ¶m for her charm and her courage.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during the December part-session.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - Mr Nassauer's speech verged on equating the volume of legislation with the amount of bureaucracy.
This is, to put it mildly, simplistic.
European legislation that creates a single set of common rules for the common market - instead of 27 contradictory and divergent rules - makes life easier for businesses and cuts bureaucracy.
Legislation which protects public health or the environment may cost money in the short run but saves far more in the long run.
Of course we all want to avoid unnecessary red rape and bureaucracy, but to give the impression that all legislation is unwelcome because it inevitably causes bureaucracy is ridiculous.
in writing. - (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I welcome the European Commission's work programme for 2008, which defines the future of the Union and the next steps in its development.
I feel it is important to emphasise that the document must contain not only principles but also specific recommendations, in the interests of essential action in European politics, especially in the area of social policy.
The emergence of ever-increasing immigration in recent years is a big challenge for all the countries of the EU.
There are not yet any adequate answers for dealing with the social and economic problems related to this.
I agree that the working papers include an integrated approach to migration and press for appropriate management of the movement of labour that is essential for economic development.
Europe needs immigrant labour, but in spite of this they are regularly affected by discrimination and various atrocities.
We cannot renounce the fundamental requirements of humanity and benevolence in our European migration policy.
Reception programmes for refugees must include the employment, training and full integration of immigrants into European society at a human level, and above all the fight against xenophobia and racism.
Legal migration must be supported, and at the same time effective action needs to be taken against illegal immigration and human trafficking.
It would be necessary to prepare a common European refugee policy in order to achieve all this.
Better, more comprehensible legislation, applied consistently, is necessary for this, and for the Union to win the confidence of citizens.
in writing. - I welcome the Commission's presentation of its work programme for 2008.
I believe its approach to the challenges currently faced by the EU, such as the volatility in financial markets, combating climate change and ensuring energy security underlines that the EU can achieve together what no one Member State could achieve in isolation.
Only by providing leadership and deliver results in these areas can the EU be assured of its citizens continued confidence.
However, I would sound a note of caution about the Commission's approach in two particular areas: I believe that moves to develop an EU-wide tax base are misplaced.
Taxation policy remains an exclusive competence of Member States and the proposed CCCTB, despite contentions from its proponents, seeks to undermine Member States' competence in this area.
I believe this will lead to tax harmonisation by default and I would be completely opposed to such a move.
Such divisive initiatives only serve to create divisions between Member States and undermine citizens' confidence in the European project.
Secondly, I believe that it is critical that the Commission strikes the correct balance in the forthcoming "health check" on the CAP and the parallel debate in relation to the EU's budget.

Interoperability of digital interactive television services (vote)
- Report: Weber
Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the convergence of television, telecommunications and the internet the television has become an interactive medium and TV viewers have become 'actors'.
The viewer can now research content, select programmes and react to broadcasts; however, to do this requires an ever growing number of devices.
In order to facilitate the use of this equipment and to avoid additional costs for the consumer these devices need to be able to communicate with each other and work together.
This is what is known as 'interoperability'.
The report being presented today seeks to promote interoperability within the European Union.
It is also aimed at ensuring respect for pluralism of information and diversity of content in the new technological era, which requires an active, steadfast and vigilant policy on the part of the public authorities at both national and European level.

Composition of the Conference of Presidents (amendment of Rule 23) (vote)
- Report: Papastamkos
- Before the vote:
Mr President, the number of non attached Members may be increased at any time, owing to unforeseen events.
This is in line with the political cohesion of existing political groups and with the possibility of achieving consensus among the non-attached Members, provided there are enough to form a political group.
In terms of legislative policy, the provisions of the Rules of Procedure concerning the composition of the Conference of Presidents should thus not be confined to cases where the number of non-attached Members is small.
The Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament contain provisions of primarily long-term validity.
They should produce useful results, not only at the time of legislation or amendment, but also under changing circumstances in the future.
For this reason, ad hoc situations, which may change at any moment and indeed may change back to the previous status quo, should not result each time in the adoption of new regulations.
This issue touches on parliamentary sovereignty, parliamentary autonomy and Parliament's ability to organise itself, and I would ask you to vote in favour.

It strengthens the individual Member's right of initiative, creates more transparency, provides a clear definition of which files can be inspected, and offers what I believe to be an intelligent solution to the question of languages, so that the smaller languages will not be discriminated against.
As we have not debated this issue, I think it is important that you should be informed about it.
Thank you for your attention.

Formal sitting - France
President of the French Republic. - (FR) Mr President of the European Parliament, Honourable Members, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for inviting me to speak to you, in this building where the democratic heart of Europe beats.
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to do so now, at a time when, after some apparent hesitation, Europe is pulling itself together and starting to move forward.
I thank you for allowing me to reiterate before you France's commitment to Europe and to state clearly that the 'no' vote to the European Constitution was not an expression of the French people turning its back on Europe; rather it was an expression of their expectation of greater things from Europe.
(Applause)
From the outset European integration has been carried along by hope.
Now - and this is a responsibility that we all bear - the people expect Europe to deliver on that hope.
Hope for peace, hope for fraternity, hope for progress.
This hope was born of the great tragedies of the 20th century.
This hope was born of the blood and tears of millions of men, women and children.
This hope was born of immense suffering.
It is the hope that never again will the people of Europe wage war on one another, that never again on European soil will we see attempts to conquer, dominate and exterminate, which led our nations to the verge of material and moral destruction.
The European idea came about because one day great Europeans reached out to each other over the borders, borders for which so many people had died. And the people who had suffered so very much followed them, deciding that hatred was a thing of the past and friendship was now what was needed.
European integration was possible because our people were horrified at what they had done.
They refused to fight any more because they knew in their heart of hearts that a new war would be fatal. Instead they chose to love each another, to understand each another, to work together to forge a common destiny.
European integration must be seen for what it is: a moral necessity, a political necessity, a spiritual necessity.
European integration is the expression of a desire shared by the peoples of Europe who recognise values, who recognise a common civilisation and who want to keep those values and that civilisation alive.
Europe cannot be just a machine.
Europe cannot be an administrative machine.
Europe cannot be a legal machine that churns out standards, regulations and directives, a machine of procedures and rules.
Europe cannot be kept separate from real life, separate from feelings, separate from human passions.
Europe cannot be a reality and has no possibility of existing unless, for millions of men and women, irrespective of their beliefs, it is something that is alive, something that speaks to them, something that gives them the hope of a better life and a better world.
Europe will either be a great ideal, or it will cease to exist.
When the people say 'no', we cannot say that they are wrong; we have to ask why they said 'no'.
We all know - and I voted 'yes' by the way - that the French 'no' vote and the Dutch 'no' vote unfortunately represented much more than a rejection of a text, important as it was.
We all know that this 'no' vote was the most visible manifestation of a deep-seated crisis of trust, which cannot be ignored and which must be resolved.
All those who love Europe must take this 'no' from two of the founding peoples, two peoples who have always supported Europe, very seriously indeed.
This 'no' expressed deep-felt anxiety: millions of men and women had begun to lose faith in Europe.
Why?
Because they had the feeling that Europe was no longer giving them sufficient protection.
Because they had the feeling that Europe had become indifferent to the difficulties they faced in their lives.
Whether or not this feeling is unfair is irrelevant.
I am convinced that millions of men and women, in all our countries, share that feeling.
This 'no' was a disaster.
It plunged Europe into the most serious crisis of its history.
But that crisis, which could have been the undoing of Europe, could also be good for it by encouraging those who were staunchly committed to the European cause to think about the reasons for the crisis.
Since the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, what has been achieved in Europe is remarkable.
All of us here are the representatives of people who hated one another, who sought to destroy one another, and some who waged war on one another for centuries.
At the outset, Paul-Henri Spaak, the great European, President of the first European Parliamentary Assembly, uttered the universal and eternal words: 'Let us not forget anything, for that would be a profanation, but we have decided to embark upon a great adventure which, if it succeeds, will allow us to save what we have in common and what we hold most dear'.
For half a century this great adventure has continued in spite of countless difficulties.
The parliamentary assemblies have played a decisive role.
And allow me to pay tribute to all those who participated in them because they represented the citizens of Europe in all their diversity.
That diversity, I believe, is something that we should not fear.
That diversity is something that we should respect; it is our greatest asset.
Democracy means debate.
It means a plurality of opinions.
It is the opposite of a system where everyone is forced to think the same thing.
Europe would die if we all had to think in the same way and if those who thought differently were seen as bad Europeans.
There is no such thing as bad Europeans.
There is just Europe, and everyone should be allowed to be part of Europe.
I believe in exchanges, I believe in discussion.
That is why I have always preferred majority rule to unanimity.
And that is no small commitment for a French President.
Unanimity is the system that allows a few to impose their will on everyone else.
Unanimity is the certainty that no great or bold decisions will ever be made, that no risks will ever be taken, because with unanimity we have to fall into step with those who want the least from Europe.
Unanimity means powerlessness.
Unanimity means that it is impossible to act.
It means that it is impossible to go back on what has been decided and that is why I supported the extension of majority voting in the simplified Treaty.
I believe in democracy.
I believe that Europe must be as democratic as possible.
That is why I have always believed that we were doing Europe no favours by rejecting debate, by stifling criticism, by concealing our differences.
I am convinced that Europe needs more debate, more democracy and, at the end of the day, more politics.
Europe has managed to break this deadlock because at the Brussels summit the Heads of State or Government, aware that they had Europe's fate in their hands, took a political decision.
On that day in Brussels the political will of the different Heads of State or Government swept away all of the obstacles that had up to then seemed insurmountable.
What did politics mean?
It meant acknowledging the failure of the draft Constitution.
It meant proposing to the French who voted 'no' to negotiate a simplified Treaty to end the deadlock in Europe and have it ratified in Parliament, as I had stated during my presidential campaign.
The French people authorised me to allow the simplified Treaty to be ratified in Parliament.
(Applause)
Let me add that it is strange to say that the European Parliament is the place where the democratic heart of Europe beats, and yet you say at the same time that parliamentary ratification in France would not be democratic: if Europe is democratic in the European Parliament, France is democratic in the French Parliament.
(Applause)
Politics for the countries that had ratified it, and I want to pay tribute to them and the parliamentarians here who had supported the draft Constitution, meant agreeing to open negotiations on a new, less ambitious text.
We managed to end the deadlock in Europe because the countries that had voted 'no' made an effort.
I want to pay tribute to those of you here who were in favour of the Constitution and who agreed to discuss a new draft.
Europe has emerged from the crisis because there was goodwill on two fronts.
The simplified Treaty is a political victory for Europe.
It is a victory of the European awareness expressed through politics.
Now - and I accept my responsibilities - it would be a mistake to think that with the simplified Treaty we have solved everything in Europe, that we can rest easy and that there will be no more questions.
The simplified Treaty resolves the institutional crisis, but the simplified Treaty does not resolve either the political crisis or the moral crisis in Europe.
It enables Europe to take decisions and to act.
But it does not say to what end and for what purpose.
It does not tell us what Europe will look like tomorrow and how it will help to improve our citizens' lives.
It does not provide those who had stopped believing in Europe with any reasons to renew their faith in it.
The institutional question has been resolved.
Now we have to resolve the political questions.
We must examine them without fear and debate them without any taboos.
Europe has chosen democracy and in a democracy we must be able to debate anything and everything: budgetary policy, trade policy, monetary policy, industrial policy, fiscal policy, all policies, whatever they are. Otherwise, there is no point in saying that we want a democratic Europe.
Europe has chosen democracy and in a democracy independence can never be confused with a complete lack of responsibility.
Nobody should be able to cite their own independence as a reason why they should not have to be accountable, explain themselves or be subject to scrutiny.
In a democracy political responsibility is a universal and fundamental principle.
In European democracy we should be able to discuss Europe's aims and objectives.
I have proposed the creation of a committee of wise men to reflect upon the future. I also believe that we should be able to discuss together the different potential futures for Europe: there are different paths available to us and I wonder how we are going to be able to choose the right one if we refuse outright to discuss them.
In European democracy we should be able to debate European identity and national identities.
We should be able to discuss how Europe is building its identity and, excuse me, defending it.
We should be able to discuss how Europe protects its national identities, which are one of Europe's assets.
We should not be afraid of these identities.
Wanting to preserve one's identity is not a sickness.
It is when identities are under threat, when they feel under attack that hackles rise and they become dangerous and aggressive.
The peoples of Europe are experiencing an extremely deep identity crisis.
It is a crisis that affects both our nations and the idea of civilisation that is shared by all Europeans and that unites Europe.
It is a crisis that is linked to globalisation and the commercialisation of the world.
Launching Europe through economics, through coal and steel, through trade was a stroke of genius by the founding fathers.
But the politics have been too slow in relation to the economy, and slower still in relation to culture.
It was a mistake to have overlooked the cultural Europe.
(Applause)
In a world threatened by standardisation, in a world dominated by technology, where economic values tend to take priority over all others, Europe cannot be Europe in the eyes of all men if it does not defend values, values of civilisation, spiritual values, if it does not do everything in its power to defend cultural diversity.
But what will we defend, as far as diversity is concerned, if we have not preserved our identities?
Europe must ensure that it is not seen as a threat to identities, but as a form of protection, a way of keeping them alive.
On a moral level, too, human rights are part of the European identity.
Throughout the world every time a human being is oppressed, every time a person is persecuted, every time a child is abused, every time a people is exploited, Europe must stand by them because the Europe of human rights is true to its word.
It is up to Europe to spread human rights to all regions of the world.
(Applause)
Let me add that all those who have in the past refused to defend human rights to get contracts have lost the contracts and have lost in terms of values.
(Applause)
In European democracy the word protection should not be outlawed.
If we do not want our peoples, fed up with being the victims of unfair competition and dumping, one day to call for protectionism and the closure of borders, we must have the courage to debate what should be a genuine Community preference.
We should be able to do as much to protect ourselves as others do.
We should be able to equip ourselves with the same instruments as others have.
If the other regions of the world have the right to protect themselves against dumping, why shouldn't Europe?
If all countries have exchange policies, why shouldn't Europe?
If other nations can reserve part of their public procurement markets for their SMEs, why shouldn't Europe?
If other nations implement industrial policies, why shouldn't Europe?
If other nations defend their farmers, why shouldn't Europe defend its own farmers?
(Applause)
Europe does not want protectionism but Europe must demand reciprocity Europe does not want protectionism but Europe has the duty to ensure its energy and food independence.
Europe wants to lead by example in the fight against global warming but Europe cannot accept unfair competition from countries that do not impose any ecological constraints on their own companies.
(Applause)
Europe is committed to competition but Europe cannot be alone in the world in making it a creed.
That is why at the Brussels summit it was decided that for Europe competition was a means rather than an end in and of itself.
Europe has opted for a market economy and capitalism but that does not mean absolute laissez-faire and financial capitalism that favours speculators and shareholders to the detriment of entrepreneurs and workers.
(Applause)
European capitalism has always been a capitalism of entrepreneurs, a capitalism of production rather than a capitalism of speculation and market trading.
Yes, I am stating loud and clear that Europe has a role to play in injecting some much-needed ethics into financial capitalism, and what we saw with the crisis in the subprime market - where a few speculators are undermining global competition - is something that Europe cannot accept.
(Applause)
We have different ideas and different points of view on all of these issues, but that does not mean we should not discuss them.
We must debate them until we have succeeded in reaching a compromise that allows us to build a common policy.
All of these issues will be at the heart of the priorities of the French Presidency.
There are many more subjects to debate: the recasting of the common agricultural policy, ecological taxation, renewable energies and energy saving, defence.
How can Europe be independent and have a political influence on the world stage? How can Europe be a factor for peace and stability if it is unable to guarantee its own security?
What does our commitment to Europe mean if we are unable to discuss the establishment of a European defence system and the renewal of the Atlantic Alliance?
What does our commitment to Europe mean if each and every one of us is unable to make an effort to ensure the defence of all?
From the ECSC Treaty to the simplified Treaty the people of Europe have built up solidarity.
We can see this in the regional policy, but we should also be able to see it in defence.
We should be able to see it in a European immigration policy.
In a Europe where people can move freely between the Member States, this policy can only be a common immigration policy.
You cannot be a member of the Schengen area and regularise without informing the other countries because regularisation in one country has an impact on all the others in the Schengen area.
(Applause)
When I was elected President of the Republic I set myself the priority of putting France back at the heart of European integration.
I wanted France to overcome its doubts by getting more involved in Europe.
I know full well that France will not be able to get its own way on every issue but I want France to recover its place at the heart of Europe.
I have re-established a dialogue with the Community institutions and I want to thank President Barroso for the relationship of trust that has been established between France and the European Commission.
France's policy now is to work closely and with complete confidence with the European institutions, that is to say, the European Parliament and the European Commission.
I will do my utmost to see to it that everyone feels that this vision is their own, to see to it that the United Kingdom ratifies the simplified Treaty, because Europe needs the United Kingdom...
(Applause)
I will do my utmost to engage in dialogue with the countries of the East, countries that often felt justifiably that they were not being listened to sufficiently.
It is not because history has condemned peoples of Europe to join Europe later that they have less rights.
They have the same rights as the founding countries.
That is the European spirit.
(Applause)
That is what I did in proposing the Mediterranean Union. I do not want anyone to be excluded and I want to build on the work done in Barcelona.
If Barcelona had been enough, we would know that.
We therefore need to be ambitious yet again.
I want France to breathe dynamism into Europe because if things are going well in France, all of Europe can benefit.
Nobody in Europe has any interest in a weak France that is unable to grow.
Nobody in Europe has any interest in a France in decline, a France suffering from an identity crisis or a France that is afraid of the future.
I have undertaken a programme of reforms.
It is not in Europe's interest for these reforms to fail because they will enable France to put its public finances in order and to fulfil its commitments.
The French people have approved these reforms.
I made my case to them prior to the elections.
That is why I will see to it that these reforms are implemented in full.
Nothing will prevent me from achieving this objective and it is the best thing that France can do for Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, in this city of Strasbourg, so dear to the people of France and irrevocably linked in the minds of all Europeans to your Assembly, your Parliament, which keeps democratic debate so alive, here at this podium where she spoke so often, I remember Simone Veil, who in 1979 was the first President of the first directly-elected European Parliamentary Assembly.
I would like to pay tribute to her contribution to the European cause and her contribution to the cause of women.
She fought for respect for their rights, for respect for their dignity, and your Parliament has always been faithful to her principles.
Simone Veil said: 'Whatever our differences, I think that we share the same desire to create a community founded on a common inheritance and a shared respect for fundamental human values.
It is in this spirit that I invite you to undertake the tasks that await us, in a spirit of comradeship'.
I make these words my own.
These words are challenges.
These challenges are the challenges that our citizens expect Europe to take on.
We must not waste any time.
Europe has already wasted so much time in the last ten years.
We must waste no time in ensuring that the people recover their faith in Europe once more.
You can count on France's unfailing commitment to Europe.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation.)
President Sarkozy, I would like to thank you for these sincere and profoundly European sentiments.
You have again demonstrated your European convictions and your commitment, and that of the French people, to the European cause.
We confidently await the French Presidency, which will take effect at a key moment for the future of the European Union when the countries of Europe will be ratifying the Reform Treaty.
I am convinced that this period will be marked by major advances along the road to a Europe of peace and solidarity.
The European Parliament, as the representative of the citizens of the European Union, will stand alongside you in this enterprise and hopes to cooperate closely with you in order to ensure that this Presidency is successful and therefore beneficial to the people of Europe.
President Sarkozy, Parliament wishes you every success, both for France and for the unification of our European continent.
Thank you.

Amendment of Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (vote)
- Report: Liese
Voting time (continued)
(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Explanations of vote
in writing. - (DE) Although Bulgaria and Romania have managed to achieve accession to the European Economic Area, Brussels is apparently surprised by the lack of progress on combating organised crime and corruption.
These are widespread problems, however, which are rooted in socio-political developments in post-communist countries.
The general public is irked by the anonymity and indifference of capitalism and resorts instead to familiar and tried and tested networks.
This proves, yet again, that social transformation cannot be imposed from outside: something that the US is trying to achieve with its wars of aggression, while the EU dangles the prospect of 'accession'.
The fact is that the latter is losing its effectiveness, forfeiting any opportunity to exert influence once countries have joined the 'club', which is why the EU must not repeat this mistake with Turkey.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to refer to Mrs Kudrycka's report on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas.
This is particularly important for relations between Poland and Ukraine, two countries and peoples that have been bound together by historical ties throughout the centuries.
The essential action required to introduce significantly easier visa procedures for our Ukrainian friends should be taken as soon as possible, notably where young people, students, academics and seasonal workers are concerned.
In the longer term, we should aim at the introduction of a visa-free travel regime.
This is particularly important in terms of laying the foundations for Ukraine's integration into the European Union in the future.
The Union must support the development of democracy in Ukraine, assist in the creation of civil society and facilitate contact between our citizens.
in writing. - (PT) This agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas is to be signed in parallel with the readmission agreement as these are 'mutually conditional'.
As indicated, these agreements form part of the EU's fight against 'illegal immigration' and its instruments.
The report expressly accepts the 'recommendations as to need for providing adequate technical and financial support for Ukraine by the EC and the European Commission in particular, in achieving high level of implementation of readmission agreement'.
However, we are critical in this respect.
Despite the agreement introducing strict procedural deadlines, setting preferential visa fees, including a full visa fee waiver for certain 'categories of persons' (?), and providing for a simplified procedure in a number of cases, this is less than what has been demanded and what is required by thousands of Ukrainian citizens.
What the rapporteurs have failed to realise is that there is a need for the effective implementation of measures aimed at facilitating issuance of visas to broader sections of Ukrainian society, or even a non-discriminatory visa exemption regime such as Ukraine provides for citizens of the various EU countries.
We therefore voted accordingly.
in writing. - (DE) For far too long, the EU has given a helping hand to countries around the globe while failing to make these monies conditional on the readmission of illegal immigrants.
This has exacerbated the flood of illegal economic refugees pouring into destination countries without any education or prospects for the future.
This has occurred in tandem with various visa scandals, in which countless people have entered the EU in the guise of tourists and promptly vanished into the EU's low-wage sector, thus destroying jobs on a massive scale.
It is high time that readmission arrangements were made a fixed element of agreements.
The opportunities to vanish into the anonymity of our conurbations must also be removed at all cost.
The growing trend towards the establishment of visa centres - which are then closed down due to a lack of applications - must also be treated with caution.
This practice must under no circumstances lead to a situation in which visas are issued arbitrarily simply to avoid such closure.
in writing. - (PT) This agreement between the European Community and Moldova on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas is to be signed in parallel with the readmission agreement as these are 'mutually conditional', just the same as with the agreements with Russia and Ukraine.
Despite the agreement introducing strict procedural deadlines, setting preferential visa fees, including a full visa fee waiver for certain 'categories of persons' (?) (such as members of official delegations, business people, journalists, participants in scientific, cultural and sporting events, students, participants in exchange programs, close relatives, representatives of civil society, persons visiting for medical reasons) and providing for a simplified procedure in a number of cases, this is less than what has been demanded and what is required by thousands of Moldovan citizens.
There is a need for the effective implementation of measures aimed at facilitating issuance of visas to broader sections of Moldovan society, or even a non-discriminatory visa exemption regime such as Moldova provides for citizens of the various EU countries.
Furthermore, these agreements fall within the Community policies on immigration and the 'Schengen area' which includes instruments on the retention of biometric data.
We therefore voted accordingly.
in writing - (RO) The Romanian Members of the European Parliament, members of the PSE, will vote against or will refrain from voting in relation to the EU-Moldova Agreement on short-term visas and the Readmission Agreement.
This does not reflect opposition to the substance of the given documents, but to the inexact concepts included therein and which were launched by the Stalinist Soviet regime in order to give credit to the idea of the existence of a Moldavian language, different from the Romanian language.
The reference to the Moldavian language remains null and void for the given Members of the European Parliament.
(PL) Mr President, I tabled this earlier. It concerns an explanation of my vote on the report on digital interactive television services by Mr Weber.
I should like to say that there is a very interesting section in that document, maintaining that the public audio-visual media should be strengthened, not weakened.
I voted in favour of the report, because recently the candidate for Prime Minister of my country declared that public television should be weakened.
I am glad that the European Parliament is making a clear statement in this regard, namely that public television and the public audio-visual media should be strengthened.
With all due respect for the subject matter, we would like to point out that this is a report the European Union could have done without.
This European Parliament should devote itself to issues within a smaller area and not give opinions on everything under the sun.
The European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education should be closed down because it deals with matters which are outside the scope of cooperation within the EU.
For the most part the Committee produces reports which propose that the Union should go in and regulate areas of detail for which the EU does not have competence.
Within the current EU cooperation framework it is established that the Member States have exclusive responsibility for the organisation of education.
Cultural issues are also a matter for the Member States, and the Union is currently engaged in very limited cooperation relating to various cultural programmes.
For these reasons there is no justification for the existence of the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report.
I support the use of interactive digital TV technology to benefit European citizens in a range of ways.
The report emphasises the importance of the switchover from analogue, which is on track in the UK but lagging in some other EU member states.
in writing. - (MT) I would like to take the opportunity offered by this debate to register my disappointment at the way in which digital television is developing in Malta.
Certain basic principles need to be respected.
Firstly, Maltese consumers should have the right to continue watching national stations that are free to view without being charged.
In practice, all digital television service providers should broadcast these stations free of charge.
In addition, anyone who does not buy a digital receiver from these companies should still have the right to receive the signal from these stations.
My second point relates to the interoperability of different platforms in Malta's case, digital terrestrial and cable.
The lack of interoperability in the Maltese system is leading to less choice for consumers because when they wish to make use of the services of another company, they must install a different receiver.
I hope that the updated policy of the authorities competent in this matter will address these problems.
in writing. - (PL) Mr Weber has tabled a very interesting report on what is currently a controversial issue.
In the present digital environment, services, networks and business systems have undergone significant changes, and a wide choice is now available to consumers.
Interoperability has therefore become a fundamental concept for information and telecommunications networks.
I agree that users' needs should be of paramount importance in market development.
Accordingly, it is important to focus on viewers and on enabling them to make fully informed choices, so that they really are in a position to benefit from the full potential of new technology.
The interoperability debate mainly concerns broadening the choice offered to consumers in the area of interactive television services.
This choice largely involves the services offered by operators rather than the equipment, however, especially as the choice can take various forms, and subscribers are able to choose between different platforms depending on the content and services available.
I agree with the rapporteur that it is advisable to continue promoting the open standards developed by European Union standards bodies in relation to the switchover to digital and the interoperability of services, and to further this action by promoting European digital television standards in other parts of the world.
We do not consider that the Committee on Fisheries' amendment adds anything positive to the Commission's proposal, but is instead a step backwards.
We cannot accept any restrictions on transparency, which is something the report in effect entails.
in writing. - (PT) The objective of the Commission proposal for a new Council regulation on the collection of data in the fisheries sector is to develop long-term sampling programmes which are well-integrated at regional level and which include ecological, economic, environmental and social data.
The revision of the Regulation on the collection of data is intended as a response to the new demands arising from the need to move towards fisheries management (geared towards fleets and fishing areas rather than fish stocks) and towards an ecosystemic approach to fisheries management.
The aim is to ensure an approach which is more in line with the different situations in the fisheries sector which require a range of strategies to combat a common problem.
The aim is also to make processes more transparent, thus guaranteeing better and more profitable treatment and use of fisheries data.
This Parliament report deserves my support.
in writing. - (PT) This proposal aims to replace, from 2008, Council Regulation (EC) No 1543/2000 establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy.
Certain differences between this proposal and the current Regulation should be highlighted, such as: inclusion of new types of data, use of an approach which is more focused on fleets and on the distinction between different regions (fishing areas) and preparation of national three-year programmes.
Among other aspects, the text adopted today clarifies the type of data to which the Commission will have access, insists on ensuring the confidentiality of this data and provides for different levels of penalisation according to the seriousness of the failure to comply with the new regulation by Member States, including making the Community financial contribution conditional on the national programmes to be developed by Member States.
It also calls on the Commission to clearly define what must be understood by 'official request for information' and 'incomplete national programme'.
It must be left to each Member State to adopt measures - based on the existence of data which is reliable and as complete as possible for the purpose of fisheries scientific research - to ensure proper management of their marine biological resources.
However, this competence of each Member State is unacceptably called into question by the 'Reform' Treaty.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this proposal from the Commission for a regulation to establish a community framework for the collection management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the Common Fisheries Policy.
It is an uncontroversial report that should allow better operation of the CFP over time.
in writing. - It is only right that small groups do not have disproportional influence in this Parliament.
While I respect the right to ensure that diversity of views is respected in debate, this should not extend to the administration of the House and other technical matters.
Thus I welcome this reduction in representation by the non-attached on the Conference of Presidents where until now a handful of Members had a higher level of representation than political groups with more than 200 members.
(DE) Mr President, I said what I had to say during the explanations of vote, in order to save time during the voting.
I am pleased that Parliament has adopted this report by an overwhelming majority, also because I am aware that there have been very arduous and intensive discussions in the Council working groups.
We are sending out a clear message from the House today.
The report offers the opportunity for us to obtain quality statistics on public health and health and safety at work.
This will be a prerequisite for many of the policies which we will be championing in future.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking partly in my capacity as future draftsman of the opinion on the Community strategy on health and safety at work.
I wish to clarify my position, which is unhesitatingly in favour of the proposed regulation to establish a legal framework for the systematic production of statistics in this area.
I would take this opportunity to emphasise the need to take all initiatives that can help provide a clearer picture of the situation in Europe and in the various Member States, on which basis states can pursue the policies they deem most appropriate.
For this reason, a more Europe-wide approach needs to be adopted towards accidents at work within the European Union, a veritable scourge in certain countries.
The approach must go beyond the current gentlemen's agreement and provide for data to be gathered systematically at regular, predetermined intervals.
It must also take due account of the studies and investigations carried out by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.
Comparable data, combined with an exchange of good practice and the dissemination of results, can in themselves prove useful in encouraging countries to emulate the best of what is being done elsewhere.
in writing. - (PT) The Commission is responsible for producing Community statistics by coordinating the necessary harmonisation of the statistical information, while collection of the data is done by Member States on subjects such as definition of variables, breakdown, dates of implementation and frequency, and so on. Gender should also be introduced as a breakdown to have information regarding possible gender differences.
As regards health and safety at work, studies and surveys of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions should also be taken into account.
Outside Europe, cooperation with the United Nations should be further enhanced, especially with the International Labour Organisation and World Health Organisation.
Complementary financing will be provided for health and safety at work in the framework of the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (PROGRESS).
In principle, financial support to help Member States in further building up national capacities to implement improvements and create new tools for statistical data collection should be included.
in writing. - (NL) The transmissible diseases that threaten Europe, such as SARS and bird flu, show that far-reaching European measures are necessary to prevent a possible pandemic in Europe.
Unilateral action by the Member States is not enough to divert the threat of such diseases.
A coordinated European plan is necessary, and for this it is essential to determine the level of protection in the Member States.
It is therefore vital to have comparable, up-to-date information at Community level on protection against possible pandemic and widespread diseases.
We must in particular consider the quantity of stocks of antiviral resources and vaccines in the Member States.
I would be happier knowing that there were already stocks of antiviral resources and vaccines at European level.
Without new powers the Commission will be forced to look on helplessly in the event of a pandemic.
in writing. - I voted against the Jordan Cizelj report on the Euratom Supply Agency.
I consider that the Agency should be independent of Euratom as the roles of promoting nuclear energy and controlling it should not in effect be joined.
The nuclear industry does not offer the solution for Europe's energy needs.
Europe must strive to make more of our renewable energy potential and work to phase out the need for nuclear.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to explain why I voted as I did regarding this very important resolution.
The European Parliament has become involved in a matter that tends to be disregarded.
Less and less physical activity is being practised in individual Member States of the European Union, and sport is taken ever less seriously, despite its significant social and cultural role.
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution in full awareness of what was involved.
I welcome Parliament's stance on the subject.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I willingly supported the report on the role of sport in education by Mr Schmitt, mainly because sport and physical activity can make an important contribution to combating negative health trends.
I also support the modernisation of activities in the area of physical education, especially those aimed at establishing a balance between physical and intellectual activities in schools.
I am in favour of investment in quality sports facilities and appropriate measures to allow access to sports premises and sports curricula at school to all students including those with disabilities.
In this way we will ensure that every student can participate in a variety of sports.
Further positive steps involve increasing the amount of time spent on physical education in schools and ensuring legal recognition of institutions and organisations that contribute to better integration of sports activities in schools and nurseries.
I would like to thank Mr Schmitt for his well thought-out report.
(NL) Mr President, I abstained on the Schmitt report on sport in education.
Just for the record, I would like to say on this subject that of course it is not that I am against sport in education, any more than I am against schools offering as many physical education lessons as possible: my view is quite the contrary.
It goes without saying that I think sports teachers should be treated in the same way as other teachers.
I abstained because I think that sport and education, and certainly the teaching of sport in general, must categorically remain within the remit of the Member States alone and that Europe does not have to take control in every area.
What also disturbs me about this report is that the multicultural society and the so-called gender question are dragged in left, right and centre, and that is a little bit too much given the political correctness in which this report is steeped.
Shoemaker, stay at your last, and European Union, for heaven's sake stick to your areas of competence.
We Swedish Social Democrats chose to abstain in the final vote.
The reason for this is that the report deals with a number of important aspects of sport in education but, at the same time, with matters which are and should remain a national concern.
We chose to vote against the statements in paragraphs 10, 24 and 47.
We share the view that physical education is important and that voluntary work is an important part of the sports movement in Europe.
However, whether you should have two, three or four hours of PE per week is not something the EU should get involved with.
Of course, it is also important that the issue of gender equality becomes an integrated part of the curriculum and that PE teachers are trained in the subject.
We also share the opinion that it is a good idea to have sports coeducation, but that is not an EU matter either.
We would like to emphasise, however, that we share the view of the report that sport is important for several reasons.
It can make an important contribution to counteracting negative health trends like obesity.
It can also contribute to added social value for society in general through its educational nature.
in writing. - UKIP approves of greater investment in and participation in sport.
However, we cannot accept that physical education be made compulsory for all and the UK parental opt out abolished by the EU, given that many groups have religious or cultural objections to sport, and also that some disabled children may not be physically able to take part in certain sports even when they would wish to do so.
Obligatory PE is an issue for head teachers and boards of governors, not for the EU.
In any case the EU has no competence on sport.
UKIP welcomes commendation of the hard work of volunteers in sport but believes that a spirit of friendly competition means this must be done at national and not EU level.
in writing. - (PT) As stated in the report, full attention must be paid to sport due to its social and cultural aspects and due to the social and educational values that it transmits, such as self-discipline, challenging personal limitations, solidarity, healthy competition, respect for opponents, social inclusion, opposition to any form of discrimination, team spirit and tolerance.
Accordingly, in our multicultural society, sport can and should be an integral part of formal and informal education, given that studies have shown that regular physical activity improves mental and physical wellbeing, while having a beneficial effect on learning abilities.
We therefore agree with the call made to the Member States and the competent authorities to ensure that greater stress is placed on health development in school and preschool teaching programmes by encouraging specific forms of physical activity suitable for these ages and raising awareness within clubs and associations in order to ensure that children can start physical activity at the earliest possible age, for the benefit of their development and health, and hence to guarantee physical education status in accordance with the profile of the institution and the corresponding level of study.
in writing. - I wholeheartedly give my backing to the Schmitt report on the role of sport in education.
The encouragement of sports participation amongst our young people is vital in a number of areas; sporting activities promote not only the obvious health benefits amongst the population but also contribute to social inclusion objectives, a sense of community and national and European cohesion.
My own country, Scotland, has one of the worst health records in Europe.
However recent Scottish sporting successes, including Glasgow's success in securing the 2014 Commonwealth Games, have captured the imagination of the population.
It is to be hoped that these successes can be channelled in a positive way and that Scotland can lose its "sick manâ tag and become an example in Europe of how sport can be used for the maximum benefit of the community.
I voted in favour of this report because it deals with a matter that is particularly important for the health of a whole generation of young Europeans, and therefore for their lives as a whole.
Increased marginalisation of physical education within the school curriculum means that the time allocated to physical education in schools in EU Member States is gradually being eroded.
The financing of school sports buildings and facilities is far from adequate.
In addition, essential equipment for the conduct of physical education classes is in poor condition.
There are also concerns regarding the quality of the training undergone by physical education teachers.
The overall picture hardly inspires confidence.
That is why we should support the European Parliament's initiative aimed at reversing the present situation.
It is to be hoped that the positive effects of this initiative will make themselves felt after just a few years.
Providing for more sport in schools is not just part of the effort to obtain better results in competitions and future Olympic Games.
It is also a way of ensuring that this generation of young Europeans will be notably healthier, fitter and not overweight, as is so often the case today.
I know what I am talking about, because in my country, Poland, the number of children and young people who are obese or overweight is increasing at an alarming rate.
I should like to believe that long-term positive results will emerge from the European Parliament's effort to draw attention to the inadequacies of the European educational system in this regard, and from its suggestions for remedial measures.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this own-initiative report, encouraging all EU member states to require physical education to be included for all school-aged children.
Encouraging physical activity among young people will help deal with problems of obesity and general lack of fitness, along with all the secondary health problems that arise over time from these consequences of a lack of activity.
in writing. - (PT) The role of sport in education is an important issue in several respects.
We can cite, for example, the obesity which is rising across Europe, particularly among young people.
This is an alarming fact and a major public health concern, the effects of which will be felt throughout the life of these people.
We cannot forget in particular that these people will have health problems throughout their life which will have considerable social and economic effects on the organisation and future of our societies.
Another important fact is the evidence that the time allocated to physical education across the EU has been gradually eroded.
It is therefore obvious that the increase in physical inactivity has also led to the most alarming of figures which is that, across the entire EU27, overweight affects almost one in four children.
I voted in favour of this report which aims to help ensure that positive measures are taken to encourage health in the new generations.
in writing. - (FR) The need to encourage the youth of Europe to take up sport has surely never been as relevant as it is today.
The reason is simple: in view of the sedentary lifestyle to which our children are now exposed we need to come up with an alternative to snacking and the games console and we need to do it quickly.
This is why I fully share the message being put across by Mr Schmitt in his own-initiative report calling for more compulsory physical education from primary-school level.
It is a message that strikes home like a double booster injection.
Double because, firstly, school is the natural place for instilling into the youngest members of our society important social values such as honesty, solidarity, team spirit, tolerance and fair play.
These are also values that have to be introduced into the family circle, for this is crucial.
Secondly, in view of the twin threat that we are now facing, namely the public health problem generated by the prevalence of obesity among our young people and the social problem that is typified by an education system based on personalised choice, the European Union and the twenty-seven Member States have to react and rethink the relationship between sport and education.
This battle is far from being won: the average child now watches two hours of TV a day, which is a lot more than the 109 minutes a week that schools set aside for PE lessons.
There are many positive objectives in the report, such as working for public health and against discrimination, and accessibility for disabled persons, but in spite of that there are too many calls and demands for detailed regulations which should not be made at EU level.
I am therefore abstaining in the final vote.
Few question the importance of children receiving physical education at school.
The negative trend of unhealthy lifestyles among young people appears to be increasing from year to year.
Mr Schmitt's report therefore touches on a pressing and important subject.
The problem with the report, not least with regard to the paragraphs voted on individually, is that Mr Schmitt goes a very long way.
It is difficult to see why the EU in particular should regulate in detail the number of hours of physical education at school, not only for primary school pupils but also for secondary school pupils.
Nor can I see any reason for Brussels to micromanage physical education, with demands for mixed gender groups and special sex education.
The last paragraph, which aims to set up a special system of commendation for various types of voluntary work, looks particularly strange, not because dedicated Europeans do not deserve appreciation, but because it is difficult to see how such a thing would be structured, administered and financed.
There is no doubt that the aim of the report is good.
However, the current formulation has turned out very dubious.
That is why I voted no.
in writing. - As a former teacher of physical education, I will be supporting the Schmitt report because it addresses not only the need to ensure that physical education is taught in schools but that Member States must also ensure adequate training for physical education teachers.
All too often, particularly at primary school level, the PE lesson is conducted by a non-PE specialist normally in a hall that doubles up as a dining room or a theatre, particularly at Christmas time.
If we are to be serious about combating child obesity, if we are serious about improving child health and if we are serious about getting children away from video games and into sport, we must provide better facilities for physical education in all schools and ensure that the teachers have the specialist knowledge to teach the subject.
For far too long PE has been a minor subject, particularly in primary schools, and lessons are often cancelled at the first whiff of rain.
This has led to a generation of children being created that is the most unfit generation ever produced.
Health and physical education is as important as maths and sciences, yet you would not know that if you entered many of our schools.
in writing. - After some consideration and serious doubts with the word "fullyâ in paragraph 8, I have voted in favour of paragraphs 8 and 10 of the Prodi report, as on balance I feel there is a need for an EU framework directive in the area of soil protection to fill in the gaps.
Such a proposal needs to be in "accordance with the principles of better lawmakingâ fully respecting the subsidiarity principle; so tomorrow, I will support the GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines proposal for a proportionate EU directive which restores subsidiarity, removes duplication of obligations and is overall, a better balance than the Commission's proposal on soil protection.
With 300 soil types in Europe, only 9 Member States with national legislation in place, and the challenge of climate change before us, there is added value in an even-handed EU approach in addressing the international challenges caused by deforestation and decline in water quality, serious soil erosion, floods and landslides and ensuring safe food production.
in writing. - (PT) It is well-known that soil has a basic social function as it is essential for the production of food and other agricultural crops and the storing and transformation of energy and minerals, in addition to functioning as a natural filter for groundwater, the main source of drinking water, the habitat for a variety of organisms living in and on the soil, the platform for human activity and an important element of landscape and cultural heritage.
It is therefore a key component of the earth's environment.
There are already several Community policies aimed at protecting these essential functions, although not the soil itself.
As the Commission's impact assessment demonstrates that soil degradation is worsening, concern is increasing about protecting the soil, linked also to concerns about climate change, safeguarding sufficient and clean water, protecting biodiversity and fighting against desertification and deforestation.
More Community legislation specifically aimed at protecting the soil itself should result in the exchange of information and coordination between Member States, without adding any unnecessary administrative burden or calling into question agricultural production and the social function of soil.
in writing. - (PT) I regard the Commission's assessment as important and I agree with the strategy proposed on the protection of soil, a non-renewable resource that provides vital services to human activities and to the survival of ecosystems.
I support the Prodi report and consider that its proposals on better defining the relationship of soil with issues linked to biodiversity, desertification and climate change are particularly important.
in writing. - Amendment 10: A framework directive is not proportional and does not respect subsidiarity.
The open method of coordination is a better mechanism than a framework directive in this instance.
Soil problems are almost always local and regional.
Amendment 8: I do not consider that an EU framework directive is fully justified.
I believe that soil protection should remain within the competence of Member States.
in writing. - (EL) The Commission's proposal on soil protection is generalised and vague.
It makes no provision for Community funding or for basic, essential projects for the prevention and replacement of degraded soils.
Particularly in the Mediterranean countries and Greece, the problems are more acute because of the warm, dry climate, geographical relief, strong winds, etc., which contribute to desertification and soil erosion.
In addition, the coastlines, which are long in relation to these countries' total area, favour salinification and the redeployment of land use for housing development.
The lack of a soil map and thematic maps results in excessive use of agricultural chemicals.
In practice, there is also an inability to promote crop rotation, because of the misconceived CAP pricing and subsidy system for agricultural produce.
In addition, the lack of any state department to record, prevent and restore pathogenic soils etc. makes this a worrying situation.
The Commission's proposal seems unable to address these problems, many of which should have been dealt with already.
As for the excuse of the wide variety of soils (320), this problem could be resolved if the proposed measures were devised on the basis of the soil pathogens to be prevented or rectified, and not on the basis of particular soil types.
in writing. - I voted for this first reading report on Commission plans to protect soil.
I am in favour of the need to protect soil, but am yet to be convinced that a directive is the right approach, or whether a less prescriptive approach would be more suitable.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report but voted against paragraphs 8 and 10 as I do not accept that there is a need for additional legislation relating to soil protection.
There is a range of legal instruments in place already to ensure the maximum protection possible for soil, and until these pieces of legislation are fully implemented and the effects are fully analysed, I do not believe that further legislation in this area is either necessary or desirable.
in writing. - (PT) Protection of the environment is a politically important issue in Europe which has developed rapidly in recent years and in which research continues to be a priority for the Union.
However, the environment cannot be protected in Europe without protecting the soil which is exposed to various degradation processes.
The need for specific protection measures within a new European framework in this area therefore makes total sense.
We recognise that, in the main, soil is in private ownership, but also that soil is a natural resource of public interest and therefore must be preserved for the benefit of future generations.
As protection of the soil is closely linked with the main international environmental challenges, there is a need to consider Community legislation which is specifically designed to protect the soil itself and which can encourage the exchange of information and coordination of good practices among the Member States.
Inserting soil protection in a future climate regime therefore seems to presuppose the recognition of the need for greater knowledge about the role of this resource in the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my support for the Prodi report.
Europe does need a common soil strategy. Soil degradation is continuing across Europe, given that existing legislation is inadequate to combat phenomena such as erosion, the loss of organic material, compaction, salinisation, landslides and contamination.
A plan of action and measures need to be devised at European level, obviously with due account for national circumstances and within a framework of subsidiarity and cooperation with the Member States.
This is crucial above all in terms of identifying areas at risk and drawing up packages of measures.
Moreover, it is vitally important that all 27 Member States should have a minimum level of legislation in this area and that education and awareness-raising campaigns be introduced.
in writing. - (PL) Multi-faceted protection of the soil is one of the main challenges for environmental protection at international level.
It also has a tremendous impact on the economies of the Member States.
I wish to express my concern about the consequences of natural degradation of the soil and degradation caused by human activity.
Degradation of the soil is often the result of inappropriate human activity in the areas of agriculture and forestry.
It can also be a consequence of industry, tourism, and urban development.
I should like to point out to the House that compliance with the provisions of the directive will make it possible for degraded land to be reclassified, thus preventing the use of green field sites for industrial and commercial purposes.
The directive will also provide for soil to be classified in terms of its potential for plant and animal production, with particular reference to the production of high quality food.
I should like to highlight the need to develop a European strategy aimed at identifying and resolving issues relating to soil degradation.
Due to the great variety of soil types, a European strategy is required, independently of national action.
Such a European strategy would be based on prevention, and would aim to raise public awareness and to persuade the public of the need for soil protection.
In addition, the strategy would identify risk areas with a view to resolving this problem at European level.
It should be noted that it is important to establish a clear demarcation between this directive and other European legislative standards relating to soil protection in order to avoid regulatory duplication.
Current European legislation does not appear to prevent degradation of the soil.
At the same time, soil protection is closely linked to the main international challenges in the area of protection of the natural environment.
I therefore believe that there is a clear need to develop Community legislation aimed at protecting the soil as such.
in writing. - The EPLP voted against paragraphs 8 and 10 of the Prodi report on Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection as it has not been proven that there is a need for a framework directive for soil protection.
As it currently stands the measures proposed in these paragraphs would be disproportionate as there is not enough flexibility or subsidiarity.
(DE) Mr President, in my view, the inclusion of aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading is a step towards meeting the conditions of the Kyoto Protocol, that is correct.
However, may I recall what Mr Sarkozy has just said.
He said that Europe must demand reciprocity, and there is none, or far too little, of that here.
Emission trading should not begin before 2012 at the earliest.
As is the case for small cars, exemptions must be in place for small aircraft under 20 tonnes in order to avoid any disproportionality.
A jumbo jet is not the same as a Cessna!
Many points in the report by the Committee on the Environment simply go too far and leave European businesses no room to manoeuvre and no time to implement the measures.
There is massive discord here.
Recalling again the words of the French President, we must think very hard, once more, about how we structure this emission trading scheme.
(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of Amendments 77, 81 and 82 in Mr Liese's report, so as to ensure that airlines operating in Europe's peripheral regions would be able to compete fairly with the central European companies.
Unfortunately, however, the majority thought otherwise.
(CS) Mr President, Parliament decided outside the scope of the Kyoto Protocol to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.
Although aviation's share of overall greenhouse gas emissions is only about 3%, in 15 years the aviation sector's emissions have doubled.
Today Europe has confirmed yet again its leadership in combating climate change.
However, we need to strike a balance.
It is only right that a proportion of allowances be allocated by auction rather than distributed free of charge, which will promote the development of young societies.
Auction revenues should be used to develop technologies to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation sector and not for other purposes.
It is well known that another strategy for reducing emissions is the integrated management of flight schedules. I am strongly in favour of a single starting date for both intercontinental and internal flights.
The Commission has to persuade third countries to join by the end of 2011.
I consider this a necessary condition for fair competition between all European airlines regardless of the company's address.
The goal of reducing global warming by two degrees by the year 2020 involves convincing the rest of the world first of all.
The international conference in Bali will soon show how successful we are in this respect.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as regards the purpose of the report, which is to include European aviation activities in the scheme for emission allowance trading, a number of questions arise.
What is beyond question, however, is that we have clear indications that this is not a particularly successful scheme, and although the Commission has data showing that it is not successful, we are now about to include aviation in the scheme as well.
That is my main point of criticism and it prompted me not to vote for the report.
By including European aviation in the scheme, we are approaching this as an isolated solution.
However, that is the very point which ultimately jeopardises the competitiveness of European airline companies and, alongside these companies, the competitiveness of European airports as well.
To my mind, this is not acceptable and we must do all we can to identify global solutions which include other airlines and other airports too.
That is the only way to achieve a solution which is good for the environment but is also good for competition in the European Union.
(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mr Liese, for his excellent levels of cooperation.
One concrete issue on which we sought compromise related to the channelling of revenue from auctions.
I would have liked to see all the revenue going to air traffic, but I am grateful that my views were even partly taken into consideration.
I start from the position that aviation is also necessary from the point of view of the environment because, for example, in the MIPS survey its benefits are clearly visible.
Another basic consideration is that the aim must ultimately be emissions-free air traffic.
That is why I am so in favour of channelling revenue into research and development in the area of aviation.
If we really see the dramatic increase in emissions from air traffic as a problem, we need to spend all our available resources on ensuring that research money goes into the development of emissions-free air traffic.
I hope that in the future the Council will bear this in mind.
I also want to say that what Mr Lehtinen just said is my sentiment exactly.
We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to support Parliament's report because it is a first step in reducing the impact of aviation on the climate.
However, we consider it regrettable that a majority in Parliament advocate both high emission ceilings and an insignificant amount of auctioning of emission allowances.
In addition, the entry into force has been postponed by a year compared with what was decided on Parliament's Committee on the Environment.
In time we would prefer to see aviation having a completely separate scheme for trading in emission allowances.
in writing. - The Emission Trading Scheme is the most effective way of dealing with climate change emissions and to facilitate the EU in reaching its target of 20-30% by 2020.
We voted today in favour of peripheral regions being taken into account in this Directive and in favour of a deletion of a Commission proposal allowing an airline to demand conversion of its aviation allowances to Kyoto-backed allowances free of charge!
We voted to lower the cap allowance which will be the predicted actual end result in negotiations in future weeks, approximately 85-90% benchmarked against 2004-06 emissions.
We voted in favour of a review of auctioning in future, if a review is undertaken regarding other sectors.
While we did not vote in favour of auctioning today, auctioning in all sectors could be considered as this would decrease the possibility of windfall profits and help increase competitiveness and innovation.
What is most important is that industry carries its share of emission cutting in an innovative way without laying the entire burden on the flying consumer.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Liese report on the proposal to amend Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading as I consider that including the aviation sector in this scheme is vital for mitigating the effects of climate change.
Aviation's contribution to climate change is substantial and growing rapidly which is why this proposal for a directive represents an important step in meeting the ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in the European Union.
However, it is essential to adopt measures so that this directive takes account of the situation in the outermost regions in order to prevent the social and economic impact of the emissions scheme on these regions being too high.
I therefore regret that Amendments 98=100/rev and 97=99/rev were not adopted.
in writing. - (PT) We have serious doubts about the general content of the proposals adopted in this European Parliament resolution, which is why we voted against it.
Firstly, we disagree with emission trading which always protects those who have more money to buy emission rights and does not solve the problem of excess CO2 emissions.
Secondly, due account has not been taken of those countries and regions where aviation services are fundamental, such as the outermost regions of the Azores and Madeira.
For example, both flights between these islands and flights between continental Europe and these regions are particularly important for territorial cohesion in the European Union, which is why these flights merit special treatment.
We regret that the inclusion of the outermost regions in the EU territory and of all the flights arriving at or departing from European airports has not been taken into account in the impact assessment for this directive.
This impact will be greater in those regions than in Europe on average, both due to the use of aircraft by their inhabitants and due to the impact of tourism on regional development.
Likewise, no account has been taken of the dramatic consequences for their competitiveness of a tax on flights from which their neighbours are exempt.
I did not support the report that seeks to include CO2 emissions from aviation activities in the European Union's scheme for emissions trading.
The Kyoto Protocol excluded aviation and while most of the nations of the world do not recognise the Kyoto agreements the European Union now wants to do more than is required under the Protocol.
This idealism is all very well from an intellectual point of view but it will not save the planet, which in any case is not in real danger as such.
However, Europe is in the act of sacrificing all its industries, including aviation, without any significant impact on the climate.
I must protest.
in writing. - (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, the Polish Members decided to vote against this report for a very simple reason, namely that not one of our comments was taken into account.
I should like to point out that Polish aviation was very well prepared for reductions of CO2 emissions within the framework of meeting the Kyoto Protocol obligations (36% of 6% obligations) and CO2 emissions are not a problem for countries like ours.
The countries of the old Fifteen, however, have so far only met 1.5% of the 8% obligations undertaken.
Hence the idea underpinning this proposal for a directive, which would enable the old Fifteen to meet their obligations at the expense of the new Member States.
Is this what the European Union is all about?
I do not think so, and I call for detailed work and reflection at second reading.
in writing. - I voted in favour of this first reading report on the Commission's proposal to include the aviation sector in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, also backing the amendments to reduce authorised emissions from the proposed 100% level to 90%.
I also supported Socialist Group amendments to include all flights originating and terminating in the EU, but unfortunately other parties did not back these and they did not pass.
Aviation is an important and fast-growing source of GHG emissions, and taking action to curb those emissions is vital in the fight against climate change.
in writing. - (PT) The adoption of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union and other industrialised countries is under way and this Commission proposal to include aviation in the emission allowance trading scheme is an important element in the set of measures to be adopted internationally.
We cannot deny the significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.
Solving the problem by means of emission allowance trading therefore seems to be a useful measure, particularly if correctly conceived and linked with other measures supporting market stability and preventing competition distortions.
The measures adopted today will set a precedent for the continuing international negotiations.
This is why the EU must adopt a firm position with solutions that are actually effective in terms of protecting the environment, whilst defending our industries and our freedoms.
Recognising that this is a difficult task, the rapporteur's work must be praised, as should everyone for their commitment to achieving compromises which are specifically aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change and balancing social and economic activities in Europe.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my support for the Liese report.
I have nevertheless seen fit to back some amendments modifying the initial draft, particularly those relating to 2011 as the date for the scheme's entry into force.
This is an especially significant point when it comes to avoiding the creation of market distortions within the European Union, albeit only for transitional periods, meaning that some operators would be at an advantage over others.
I have backed certain other amendments too, on matters such as the percentage of allocations to be auctioned, and the use to be made of funds gathered in this way, provided that this does not set a precedent for reducing the financial room for manoeuvre falling within the exclusive prerogative of Member States.
in writing. - I have voted in favour of the Liese report, even though I have doubts about its practicality and its implementation.
I agree that aviation has to be included in any emissions trading schemes, but a balance has to be found between environmental considerations and those of the aviation industry.
In addition, this scheme as proposed is highly contentious outside the European Union with many states threatening court action against the EU, including the USA, India and China because they believe any scheme involving aviation must be agreed internationally before implementation.
It is right that aviation should be involved in ETS.
It is wrong to single out aviation as a major CO2 creator without also addressing the maritime industry and the biggest CO2 creator in transport, road transportation.
Some of the suggestions outlined by the Committee on the Environment in its report were frankly extreme.
Parliament has taken a more pragmatic and balanced view.
But still I see problems ahead for this proposal in the months to come, not least on the international stage and not least that we have exempted private jets.
in writing. - (DA) I voted in favour of the final version of the Liese report, as it was a small step forwards in comparison to the Commission proposal.
However, the report leaves much to be desired in relation to the steps necessary in order to combat climate change, and therefore demonstrates that the European Parliament is not at the forefront of this battle.
The outermost regions together contribute to combating climate change and regularly demonstrate their commitment to continuing in the same vein by becoming veritable centres of innovation in this area.
I support the objectives being pursued by the inclusion of aviation activities in the scheme for emissions trading.
However, the outermost regions could not support the implementation of the Commission's proposal as it stands, for otherwise the aviation companies that operate in these areas would have no other option but to pass the new surcharges directly on to ticket prices, to the detriment of overseas passengers and tourists who are already penalised by the high cost of air travel, and to the cost of air freight, which in turn will lead to price rises that will hit consumers and businesses in these outlying regions.
I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur for having listened to my appeals on this subject, and to Parliament for having finally endorsed the principle of granting special treatment for the outermost regions in this particular matter.
I also welcome the fact that Parliament has accepted the possibility that part of the funds resulting from the emissions-quota bidding scheme might be used to reduce the negative impact of this project on the accessibility and competitiveness of the outermost regions.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, we all know that it is important to ensure that environmental protection is in place and to fight against climate change.
Our actions have to remain within the bounds of common sense, however, and we, as decision-makers, should view things as a whole.
In my opinion, the majority on Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have not viewed the matter in all of its aspects with regard to this report.
Emissions from aviation account for just 2% of total emissions and so they should be dealt with in proportion to the whole.
That is to say, even if our entire aviation service were to cease, this would have barely any effect on global warming.
We also have to realise that many airlines have already invested significantly in improving the environmental friendliness of their fleets.
I voted in favour of Amendments 77, 81 and 82, to allow air traffic to continue to survive in Europe's remotest regions.
I do not see the point of having air traffic structured mainly around just a few large airports.
Competitiveness between national airlines should not be short-sightedly impaired to the cost of the cut-price carriers.
I therefore agree with what Mr Lehtinen said in his speech.
That concludes voting time.

Application of the Schengen acquis - Application of the Schengen acquis in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the Council Declaration on application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, and
the report by Carlos Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic (11722/2007 - C6-0244/2007 -.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am absolutely delighted to be here today before this House, on behalf of the Presidency and the Portuguese Republic, to discuss the imminent enlargement of the Schengen area.
Only a year ago dark clouds were hanging over Europe with the risk of an extremely serious political crisis due to the technical impossibility of bringing the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS) into operation in 2007.
Indefinitely postponing the satisfaction of the reasonable expectations of free movement of citizens from the Member States which joined the European Union in 2004 would not only have been an intolerable demonstration of technological incapacity but also, in particular, a heavy defeat for the European ideal and evidence of the impotence and incompetence of our institutions and Member States.
We could have given these citizens a thousand explanations but all would have sounded like feeble excuses and would have invited a search for the guilty parties, thereby preventing the practical solution of the problem.
Fortunately, we took another route with a speed and cohesion that was truly without precedent.
First of all, we found in Lisbon the appropriate technological response to the technological crisis.
SISone4all was a project conceived in around 30 days with its feasibility study being scrutinised by top European experts within a similar timescale.
In December 2006 the JHA Council was able to green light the start of the process with a schedule of operations worthy of a European version of the film 'Mission Impossible' and with a minuscule budget, little more than half a million euros.
In March, as promised, the software application - a clone of the Portuguese N.SIS (National SIS) - was ready and was delivered to the new project partners.
The C.SIS (Central SIS) also underwent a major upgrade thanks to the total commitment of the French Republic, which we must thank.
The German Presidency drove forward the appropriate legal measures with impeccable timing.
On 31 August we managed to finish installing the applications and migrating the data which was a difficult and complex process.
The next day, the security forces of the new Member States gained access to the new tools which they then started to use with great success.
It only remained to check whether all the other many measures needed for admission into the Schengen area had been adopted with equal success, such as those relating to land and sea borders, police cooperation, data protection and issue of visas. Fortunately, these have been adopted.
Last week, on 8 November, the JHA Council learnt that the Member States in question have demonstrated a sufficient degree of preparation in order to satisfactorily apply both the provisions not relating to the SIS and the provisions relating to the Schengen Information System of the Schengen acquis.
I should like to thank, here in this House, everyone who implemented the changes and carried out the assessment programme in recent months.
Particular mention should be made of the important work carried out by the many experts involved in the visits which enabled the transformations achieved in just a few months to be confirmed without a shadow of a doubt.
We now have, at what will be the new external border of our European Union, some of the most sophisticated and modern equipment, organisational solutions which deserve prizes for innovation and appropriate procedures for ensuring a very high level in the fight against crime.
These will be supplemented by special policing measures, already agreed on a bilateral or multilateral level, so that, in the 'day after' the abolition of controls, there is more freedom but no less security.
I must also stress that the concern for maximum transparency led the Portuguese Presidency to take very successful steps so that the European Parliament could access the information resulting from the enormous effort made.
This House was therefore able to verify the absolute rigour of the impact assessment summary which we also wanted to provide as a separate document.
I must congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, on his total commitment to meeting the deadlines set and on the excellent quality of his report.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the method we need to use in order to overcome the future challenge of setting up and managing, in an integrated manner, the SIS II, VIS (Visa Information System) and new information systems on travellers which Vice-President Frattini recently announced.
No one should have any illusions as mega-projects of this kind can be huge successes or heavy failures.
Success can only be achieved with strong command structures, determined leadership and very tight schedules.
We do not need a technology tsar but rather a great deal of work in a democratic network involving the Commission, Member States and the European Parliament, as was demonstrated in exemplary fashion in this case.
I should also like to officially thank all those who contributed to this success.
This is the secret of the success of SISone4all and only in this way can we save resources, create synergies between projects and in particular, ladies and gentlemen, meet deadlines.
There is only one requirement to be met before the Council can take a decision, which is planned for December 2007, on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the new Member States. This requirement is your vote, the vote of the European Parliament.
I hope I can count on its result and be confident in this respect, given the very positive content of the motion for a resolution which is already on the agenda.
Please allow me, finally, to give warm thanks for the very complimentary comments which, through this motion for a resolution, the European Parliament has made to the Presidency and the Portuguese Republic.
On behalf of the men and women who in recent months have dedicated themselves to our task of preparing for this historic decision which will finally bury the Iron Curtain, I must say that we were not inspired only by a desire for victory and to avoid a serious crisis.
We mobilised the best know-how in Europe, we took advantage of the tools of the new digital Europe to quickly discuss our plans and difficulties and we created a fantastic network of experts and a 24/7 help desk to find solutions.
All of this was accompanied by close and unprecedented liaison between experts and politicians, the ministers in this area who periodically met in special meetings to direct the process with the total solidarity of the Commission.
I must particularly highlight the role of Vice-President Frattini.
We also never forget, ladies and gentlemen, that Europe has its parliamentary representatives, whose opinion must have a bearing on what we do.
We took due note of your recommendations and we are counting on your representation at the commemorative ceremonies to mark the historic enlargement of the European area of free movement, which will take place on 21 and 22 November.
Thank you, too, ladies and gentlemen, for your contribution to this historic result.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate all the Member States on their achievements in making it possible for citizens in Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, Malta and in the current Schengen countries to finally fully benefit from the free movement of persons, which is one of the pillars of the European Union.
This is a real benefit for the citizens of the Member States that joined the EU in 2004.
It will make travelling quicker and easier.
For all the Member States of the European Union, this shows the benefit of acting together in the European framework.
An area without internal border control is an amazing achievement, without historical precedent.
From 21 December onwards, travel will be possible from, for example, the Iberian Peninsula to the Baltic States and from Greece to Finland without border checks.
This is truly symbolic of a united Europe and a basic right for all European citizens.
As you are all aware, this historic achievement follows much preparation.
Joining the Schengen area is not an easy undertaking.
It is a challenge, and we must strike the right balance between freedom and security.
Lifting internal border controls is also a question of trust between Member States.
It is through a peer evaluation process, the 'Schengen Evaluation', that Member States gain confidence in each other's capacity to guard the external borders on behalf of all the others and issue visas valid for the whole Schengen area.
Member States will also improve police cooperation and security controls within the broader Schengen space, in order to prevent criminals from enjoying free movement and better opportunities to act illegally.
