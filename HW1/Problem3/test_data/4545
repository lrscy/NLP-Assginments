On the one hand, the EU talks about moderate drinking; on the other hand, it wants to sell more wine.
The two things do not go together.
Of course, the EU's wine market needs to be reformed, but let us do it sensibly.
Wine markets vary and, by tradition, function in different ways, and the desires and demands of the public in the EU also vary.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, two proposed measures that stand out are those of grubbing up the vines and adding sugar to wine.
The first is a counterproductive and environmentally unfriendly procedure essentially entailing the forced exodus from their jobs of thousands of small and medium-sized growers who, instead of receiving assistance to stay in their jobs, are being sent away to form a cheap workforce.
As for the addition of sugar, our rejection is based on the fact that a permitted increase to 4.5% vol. and the use of the term 'wine' for drinks which are not made from grapes will downgrade the quality and special characteristics of wine.
Furthermore, the so-called 'simplification of labelling' will contribute further to the downgrading of quality because it will not include the obligation to indicate the area where the wine was produced.
Here I would like to point out that rightly or wrongly, for example in my country in the past, mass grubbing-up operations were carried out, for which, however, no financial assistance measures are now included at European level.
With a clear conscience we shall vote against the proposal, and shall support the minority proposal which addresses the social and economic concerns of the producers in my country, Cyprus, and those of other European producers.
Now should be the time to assist the producers, instead of sending them into a spiral of unemployment and reduced income.
Madam President, I come from a constituency in Scotland which does not produce wine.
Indeed, climate change will have to change things considerably before we can produce any wine in Scotland!
However, we do produce some very good whisky, which I would recommend.
I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Parish, who has to attend a meeting with Mr Michel Barnier in Paris, and on behalf of the UK wine sector, which Members know is very small - it represents 0.01% of the whole of EU wine production - but which seeks no subsidy or financial assistance from Europe at all.
However, unless there is an increase in the de minimis level of production to 50 000 hl, the UK would have to impose a planting ban up until 2014.
In a tiny sector like this, where there is some need for expansion, it would be deeply unfair if we were to do that.
Even if the UK sector expanded fourfold by the end of the planting rights system, which is highly unlikely, it would still only represent 0.05% of total EU production, which is one 2000th of entire EU wine production.
I therefore hope that Members will be sympathetic to Mr Parish's amendments.
I am not trying in any way to undermine the compromise.
Mr Castiglione has done a wonderful job - we had 795 amendments - and, by seeking a compromise, has got the amendments down to manageable levels.
I do not want to do anything to upset that, but I hope there will be sympathy for the UK position.
(FR) Madam President, I first wish to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, for bringing about a considerable shift in the Commission's positions.
We are certainly faced with a paradox here: on the one hand, there has never been so much wine drunk all over the world, and on the other, although in 10-15 years we will be witnessing record progress in wine consumption worldwide, we are told that Europe is overproducing.
Thus I have the feeling that, rather than overproduction, what we have here is a sales problem, mainly down to marketing, and that is why I do not want the reform proposed to us today to be tempted to lower the sector's standards even slightly in order to fall into line with the new wine-producing countries.
We must remember what has happened to European industry.
Today Europe's leading industrial producer is Germany.
Germany has stayed at the top of the class, it has refused to cut down on production and today it is the world's leading exporter, even with the arrival of China and India on the international stage.
We cannot cut back on the quality of our vineyards and their brand image.
We must not, therefore, give in to a crude industrialisation of the wine industry, which in the future would supply us with Heineken wine, Danone wine, Coca-Cola wine and Pepsi-Cola wine.
I do feel, however, that the Commission is tempted to get rid of the smallest and favour the biggest.
That would result in us losing our soul!
I am thus asking you, Commissioner, to ensure that all of the elements that contribute to the quality of wine and can improve that quality - reducing yields, marketing support, careful protection of geographical indications and designations of origin - are preserved, not only within the EU, but also outside it, when it comes to major multilateral negotiations.
I feel this is extremely important: otherwise we will be losing what is undoubtedly one of the most important elements of our agricultural industry, and our European civilisation: wine is a product of culture and civilisation.
This is why we cannot give in to the mirages of the market and industrialisation.
(DE) Madam President, politics is the art of the possible.
That maxim also applies to this latest reform of the common organisation of the market in wine.
It must be said, however, that the Commission's assumption in 2006 was unmarketable wine surpluses in the EU, which have not materialised, and that its legislative proposal largely disregarded the opinion delivered by Parliament in February.
As was the case back in 1999, we have managed, by dint of tenacity and resourcefulness and in close cooperation with the trade, particularly in the cross-party working group on wine, to work out a compromise with which the wine trade in both southern and northern Europe should be able to live, provided that growers produce good wines and vintners are able to market them effectively inside and outside the EU.
It is our intention to create the requisite set of instruments and make the regions responsible for using them within an appropriate financial framework.
In the irksome dispute about winemaking processes that was unnecessarily fuelled by the Commission, we once again reached an agreement, very largely on the basis of the 1999 compromise, even though the Commissioner is still not happy with that.
Common sense and awareness that sales problems in the South will not be solved by making it impossible to produce marketable wine in the North have won the day, and I hope they will also secure a large majority here.
The devil, as always, is in the detail.
I respect the compromise, for which the rapporteur himself had to make concessions too, and all credit to him for that.
For this reason I do not intend to table any new amendments, although I shall not refrain from expressing my opinion when it comes to the vote on disastrous specific proposals that have nothing to do with the compromise.
It is utterly counterproductive, for instance, to insist that wine labels bear an indication of the origin of EU grape must which is used to enrich the wine if the aim is to encourage that form of enrichment.
The important thing is that the reforms help to guarantee sufficient production potential in terms of quantity and quality to maintain our global market lead and to ensure that we in the EU and elsewhere drink far more wine for the sake of our health!
(Applause)
(PL) Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur.
In addition, I would also like to express my gratitude to all members of the Committee on Agriculture for the hard work they have put into achieving consensus on such an essential but also very complicated issue as reform of the market in wine.
I think we all agree that changes in the sector are needed in response to the processes of globalisation and trade liberalisation.
We do not always agree, however, on how to bring about such changes.
There is therefore all the more reason for us to deem the agreement reached on key issues for wine producers a joint success.
The agreement takes account of the needs and conditions of the various regions of the Community, which differ in terms of natural environment and climate. Wine production methods therefore differ accordingly.
In particular, I wish to highlight the amendment enabling Member States to use the term wine to refer to wines other than grape wines.
In certain parts of Europe the fruit wine tradition dates as far back as the 12th century.
This is all part of our common cultural heritage.
Consequently, it is important not to introduce any potentially confusing changes to the labelling of fruit wines.
Wines produced using fruits such as apples and currants are marketed under the designation of fruit wine or wine named after the fruit in question.
These wines established themselves on the European market many years ago, and I am glad that the provision regarding fruit wine has been retained.
(HU) Thank you very much.
I would like to raise three issues, since the wine sector is too far-reaching for me to cover all the issues.
The first issue is that of grubbing aids, the second is that of restructuring aid for upgrading vineyards, and the third is that of the compulsory distillation of by-products.
I agree with the bases for the reform.
The current rules for the wine sector are unsustainable.
Aid for distillation must be stopped because it is wasteful.
Instead, surpluses are created, and in order to stop this we must grub a significant proportion of vineyards.
We have been OK up to now.
The trouble starts here, since this can only be done properly if we grub the vineyards and concentrate grubbing aid on the regions that produced the surplus.
This is not happening.
In fact, what is happening is that the Member States and regions that do not produce a surplus will have to bear an unfairly large burden under this reform.
This is particularly unacceptable for the new Member States since, before the accession, when we were still outside the EU, we did not receive any distillation aid, nor did we produce any surplus.
Since then, approximately 10% of our vineyards in Hungary have been grubbed.
This is not taken into consideration by the reform, which moreover is taking place now, when not only do we not produce a surplus but we have become a net importer.
This reform burdens most of all the countries that had balanced wine production, and indeed we produced more or less as much wine as was consumed.
The second issue I would like to raise is that of aid for upgrading vineyards.
It is particularly unacceptable that this form of this aid is falling in Hungary.
Madam Commissioner should not be afraid that she is opening Pandora's box!
It is much better to have a debate than to make an unfair decision.
The Parliament's decision will offer an appropriate solution, and it will recommend that upgrade aid should not be less in any Member State than it was in 2007-2008, and this would be a good solution.
I also support the repeal of the rules relating to the compulsory distillation of by-products, because it is a wasteful, superfluous measure and it is not sustainable from the perspective of environmental protection.
Thank you very much.
(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I agree that wine regulation up to now has been bad, and at the same time it is very questionable whether this wine reform will be good.
There are countless questions, because it is obvious that this reform is essential but will be to the detriment of the poorest wine-producing regions.
The distribution of the national envelopes system - which the Commissioner spoke about - is extremely harmful to the new Member States.
This wine reform is discriminatory and rewards those who have up to now produced poor quality wine for distillation because they receive their money all the same.
Parliament has moved in the right direction, and the final compromise could be that two thirds are the area and quantity and one third is the historical reference.
It will be very useful to still have the opportunity for increasing the alcohol content for sugaring.
Marketing is an extremely important factor, but this must be ensured within the Union too.
I completely agree with the repeal of distillation, and this is the most positive element of the reform, but I reiterate that this money will be received by those who have produced for distillation up to now.
The concept of grubbing aid is flawed, since it is very attractive for the poorest Member States.
We in the new Member States will also have to grub grapes that produce good quality.
Thank you for your attention.
(PL) Madam President, the main aim of this reform should be to achieve sustainability and improved competitiveness for the Union's wine sector.
It is also important to strengthen the position of renowned European wines that boast centuries-old traditions so that they do not lose out to wines from the so-called New World.
The budget allocated to that market should be used more wisely.
We should not promote distillation. Instead, we ought to promote European wines in order to recover lost markets and win new ones.
I should like to mention three important issues.
Firstly, as regards the option to add sugar, the status quo must be maintained.
Secondly, the status quo must also be maintained as far as fruit wines are concerned.
This means that it should remain possible to use the term wine to designate fruit wines.
Thirdly, the de minimis level should be increased to 50 000 hectolitres, for example.
This would stimulate production and contribute to the development of local winemaking in countries that do not produce large quantities of wine.
The change would not have any impact on the Community market in wine.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, as we have heard today, the tradition of viniculture goes back hundreds of years.
For decades we have been trying to improve the quality of our wines, and those efforts have been extremely successful, which I, as an Austrian, can say of my own country's efforts too, particularly those of my home province of Burgenland.
Part of this success, however, has been down to the use of sucrose as required.
Having to top up the sugar content of wine with must concentrate from other regions would mean influencing and even altering the character of our region's wines.
We certainly cannot consent to that, nor would it make any sense to our growers, who have been nurturing high quality standards for many years.
It is unthinkable that sucrose as an additive should be abolished and replaced with must concentrate to compensate for the abandonment of the very costly practice of crisis distillation.
For this reason, I believe we should support the old compromise package, which will enable us, among other things, to preserve regional winemaking cultures and traditions.
- (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that new rules of play are needed in the wine-making sector.
European viticulture is the last part of our agricultural policy that is still not reformed and still works on the principle of 'the higher the yield, the more money from Brussels'.
This often leads to wine producers paying more attention to quantity rather than quality, which has not escaped our European customers.
They are increasingly choosing wines from California, Chile or South Africa in preference to our Moravian, Czech, French or Italian wines.
We should support quality and competitiveness.
However, this must not involve discriminating against certain Member States while favouring others.
If we really want to agree on a reform of the wine sector, it cannot include the proposed ban on the use of beet sugar for wine enrichment.
Each of our countries has different climatic conditions and different traditions.
The geographic environment of the countries situated in the more northerly parts of Europe is vastly different from that of the southern ones.
Our colder climate often makes it necessary to enrich our wines with sugar.
In my country sugar has been used for wine enrichment for over 200 years; it is a traditional method.
The European Commission suggests banning sugar enrichment and substituting it with wine must concentrate instead.
Concentrated wine must, if not subsidised, costs at least twice the price of sugar, besides which it is only produced by a few countries.
If we were to use wine must concentrate or rectified must concentrate to enrich our wines, we would have to import it from other countries, which would contravene one of the basic principles of European viticulture, and that is defining the origin of the wine by the origin of the grapes.
Apart from that it would raise the price of the wine and consequently make it less competitive on the market.
That, in my opinion, would be discrimination.
While the Commission objects to the sweetening of wines, nobody seems to be concerned about their souring, that is about the addition of tartaric acid, mainly in the southern European countries.
I would like to raise a glass of honest wine to an honest reform without discrimination and favouritism.
I fear that wine ought to be made from grapes!
(HU) Thank you for the floor, Madam President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of reforming the wine market is to encourage the production of acceptable, good-quality wines.
We welcome the fact that the recommendation will continue to make it possible to increase the alcohol content with sugar in those areas where it qualifies as a traditional method.
There are good wines in the new Member States, including Hungary, and we do not usually produce a surplus.
If a wine is of good quality, it does not matter whether or not it was produced by adding sugar.
However, modernisation and restructuring are necessary to make wines more marketable.
The role of marketing and the provision of a larger national budgetary framework are particularly important in the interests of making investments to promote the change in structure, especially in the new Member States.
It is for precisely this reason that we cannot accept the recommendation that historically based distribution should have a prominent role in the shaping of the national envelopes, which would lead to discrimination and mainly benefit the countries responsible for over-production.
Thank you for your kind attention.
(SK) The European Union is a wine producer of global importance.
By producing high quality wines it has secured a dominant position on the world market.
However, as a result of globalisation, European wine production is facing the threat of cheap wine imports from the US, South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
Cheaper wines from third countries may bring joy to European consumers, but they are a headache for European producers.
Due to their higher production costs, European wine producers will struggle in a fully open market and that is why we need to reform our wine sector.
EUR 1.3 billion is allocated to the wine sector in the EU budget.
We must use that money to take positive steps towards increasing the quality and attractiveness of our wines as well as for research and development of this sector.
Wine-growing in Slovakia has a long history and it has always been, and still is today, a difficult business.
As wine merchants put pressure on producers to lower their prices, they in turn cannot afford to pay the growers adequate prices for their grapes.
There is a legitimate fear that in their struggle for survival the wine growers will be lured by subsidies into destroying their vineyards.
The danger is that vineyards will be destroyed in areas where no surplus wine is being produced.
To try and limit the grubbing-up to the South of Europe, where there are surpluses and they are being dealt with by subsidised crisis distillation, would be politically unfeasible, as would simply banning sugaring in the north of Europe.
In Slovakia, as in Germany and also in Austria, there is a very long tradition of wine enrichment with sugar.
I would like to express my appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Castiglione, who has taken such a balanced approach to a topic as emotive as wine.
He has managed to negotiate a viable compromise, which takes into account all the different aspects of the wine sector.
Above all he endeavours to reconcile the interests of all the producers, North and South.
Only a good reform of the wine sector can help preserve the best wine-making traditions in the EU, strengthen social structures, and enhance the quality and attractiveness of our countryside, while protecting the environment.
I am sure visitors to all the various wine-growing regions of Europe will appreciate and enjoy sampling the characteristic wines produced from locally-grown grapes.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, yes, a reform of the COM in wine is desirable, but are the means put forward by the Commission the most suitable?
From the Brussels viewpoint, we can understand the mathematical equation between a decrease in production and a decrease in the number of producers, but from the viewpoint of south-west France, the plains of Italy, the Spanish or Portuguese coasts, Commissioner, I can assure you that it is not the same thing, and this is an issue which should not be observed through the prism of the economist's spectacles.
Winemaking means men and women who live off the fruit of their labours.
Vines are their livelihood, and we cannot push them towards the exit door without concerning ourselves as to what they will do for a living.
Moreover, what is the logic in grubbing-up, on the one hand, and on the other suggesting the total liberalisation of planting rights as of 2013?
My second question is as follows: why eliminate this regulatory tool when we have no assurances as to how the market will evolve?
If we really want to fight overproduction, I suggest we order illegal plantings to be grubbed up first.
For you know as well as I do that there are quite a few of these in Europe.
The report also makes provision for a greater variety of measures accessible through the national support programmes.
This is a good thing, because the Commission's proposal on this point is extremely restrictive.
I therefore regret the insufficiency of the section dealing with crisis prevention.
We know how liable wine production is to yearly variations depending on weather conditions, and crisis prevention measures will only help to mitigate the fluctuations.
I wish to conclude by saying that I understand the rapporteur's caution on enrichment, which is a sensitive issue, but it is regrettable that authorisation has not been proposed to combine additive and subtractive enrichment methods, which would allow producers to reduce their use of sucrose.
As for the rest of the report, the general approach appears to be going in the right direction, and I will support the rapporteur's excellent work.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I can hear that you, as well as the rest of the Members of the European Parliament, take a huge interest in the future of the European wine sector.
I do not have enough time at this stage to go into details, and we have already had in-depth discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, so I am just going to leave you with quite a simple message with regard to the future of our wine reform.
It is time to do a deal.
I am quite sure that a reform will make a huge difference for our wine sector and it is time to do a deal because, as rightly mentioned here today, we see an increase in imports, we see an increase in production, but we see a reduction in domestic consumption.
It is time to do a deal because we can spend the budget of the wine sector in a much more intelligent way or in a better way than we do today, in ways which will strengthen the sector and also make much more sense to the public and to the taxpayers.
I think that a deal is within our grasp but, of course, I say as well that it must be the right deal.
We live in the real world, and I have shown considerable flexibility over many of my original proposals, but I will not allow the proposal to be watered down so far that the end product loses all its taste and all its value.
The compromise that we find must give us a reform worthy of the name and it must give us a real chance of achieving the goals that we have set for ourselves.
We can strengthen the competitiveness of our wine sector, we can achieve a better balance between supply and demand and we can make a big improvement in the rules on labelling and many other issues. We can do all this in such a way that wine production remains a jewel in the crown of European agriculture, as very rightly said by Ms Herranz GarcÃ­a today.
It is not the time to make excuses for inaction and watch emerging opportunities just slip through our fingers.
Now is the time to set our wine sector firmly on the road towards new successes.
I know that I can rely on decision-makers who have the sector's best interests at heart to do the right thing, and I know that I can count on the cooperation of the European Parliament.
I would like to thank you and, again, Mr Castiglione for this very difficult task of bringing together all the different opinions within the European Parliament.
Thank you, Commissioner.
I have allowed myself to make the odd remark today because we are not short of time.
You hit the nail on the head: when I was small I almost died from breathing in the vapours emitted by grapes being trampled underfoot in a vat, so there is a close link between life and death.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) Italy and the Italian Members of this House have always defended the European project, in the interests of social rights, consumer protection and our citizens' quality of life.
The European agricultural policy came about in order to support our farmers and enhance the quality of European produce, so as to strengthen the EU's position in the world marketplace.
Today, however, with the vote on the reform of the wine market, we have taken several steps backwards in this sector, especially in the Mediterranean countries and regions to which Europe owes the fame and success painstakingly acquired by European wines worldwide.
Backing sucrose enrichment, without even demanding that it be indicated on the label so as to inform consumers, preferring grubbing-up to land rehabilitation, permitting the circulation of planting rights throughout the EU: all of these are practices which, as Europeans and especially as Italians, we find unacceptable in that they will damage the quality and image of one of the products which best represent the quality of European agriculture around the world.
I hope that my colleagues in the Council will make a better fist of defending the future of our wine and of all our wine-growers.
in writing. - (FR) The European Commission certainly finds it hard to abandon the stereotypical approaches it applies to all sectors indiscriminately.
Wine cannot be treated like spare parts for cars or some other industrially manufactured product.
It is a product that shapes regions, cultures and ways of life.
As far as the COM reform is concerned, if it is necessary it must preserve European winemaking, not get rid of it or disfigure it.
It must support the adaptation of wine producers - particularly the subsequent restructuring of sectors - and give them the means to reconquer the internal market.
Nor should planting right restrictions be lifted.
They provide a guarantee for control of production and continued quality.
In relation to crisis management tools, if the EP improves the situation with respect to the Commission's initial proposal, I can only regret that crisis distillation - which, if compulsory, would not create the excesses we are seeing now - is no longer an option among the possible instruments for handling temporary crises.
CAP: common rules for direct support schemes and certain support schemes for farmers and support for rural development (debate)
The next item is the report by Jan Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - C6-0283/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for its efforts on this report and, of course, especially the rapporteur Mr Mulder and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I know from various talks that Mr Mulder closely follows this topic, and my services and I have carefully assessed the different amendments that have been proposed.
I have read with great interest the report drawn up by Mr Mulder.
I really appreciate the strong, dedicated interest of both Mr Mulder and the European Parliament on this topic.
I also appreciate the support that the rapporteur repeatedly expressed for cross-compliance in his report.
As I have said several times, this system is right and necessary and it needs to stay if we want society to support our agricultural payments.
I know that we are completely on the same line.
I could broadly agree with the explanatory statement accompanying the amendments proposed in the report.
In particular, I can endorse the call for having the simplest possible system without watering down its efficiency.
I think we have fulfilled this objective to a large extent with the proposal concerning the control and the sanction system.
Of course, we have the possibility and the chance to continue this work in our health check, where we will mainly focus on the scope of the application of the cross-compliance system.
As regards the amendments tabled to our proposal for a Council regulation, we all have to keep in mind that the discussions were very lively in the Council.
Our initial proposal has evolved and we now have a compromise text agreed by the Commission that is the result of intense discussions.
The Portuguese Presidency has, as far as possible, reflected in the compromise the ideas that you have been raising in the preparation of your report.
On the concrete amendments to the legal provisions you are now proposing, I have to say that they are not relevant to the Council regulation we are discussing just now: a number of them concern the control rules that are under Commission competence and, as I said, the new Commission rules will soon be finally approved.
I think Mr Mulder's main concerns have been taken on board, and this is the case, in particular, for the improved flexibility that Member States will have to adapt the control system to their administrative organisation.
We have also widely extended the possibility for prior notice of controls.
Another set of Parliament proposals has been discussed in depth at the Council and the compromise reflects all those different opinions.
It is a case of the possibility of getting rid of the 10-month rule - I think fixing a date is a much better idea - the follow-up for the de minimis and minor infringement cases, and the phasing-in of full cross-compliance for the new Member States applying the simplified system.
We want to stick to this compromise text, which was intensively negotiated.
Finally, we will take the opportunity to discuss your proposal to extend the period for the prolongation of the Single Area Payments Scheme (SAPS) system; we will have this opportunity within the discussion on the health check.
As you might have noticed, I personally consider this a very good idea.
I will be back for final comments.
Madam President, following the Commissioner's introduction there is not really much more debate required, but I would still like to throw some light on the position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The first element is cross-compliance.
I do not know what it is called in other languages but we have adopted this word in Dutch.
It is a familiar term amongst the farmers.
We do indeed support this, as the Commissioner just said: it is an essential aspect of agricultural production and we think that this is defensible, because it sets requirements for agricultural production that go beyond what is necessary to ensure that the products from agriculture are fit for human consumption.
We go beyond that with all kinds of Directives: Birds and Habitats Directives, environmental Directives, animal welfare standards, etc.
The big question in all this is: what form should the checks take?
As far as the checks are concerned, I think that as we have more and more reforms it will be essential to have widespread support and understanding of the system of cross-compliance among farmers.
If the methods are too bureaucratic, as they are at the moment, that will not be fostered.
What could we change in this area?
First, there are too many controlling agencies in individual Member States at the moment and they also still visit on different days.
We are convinced in this report that the number of controlling agencies should be kept to a minimum, that the checks should also be carried out on one day, and that the farmer should be given reasonable advance notice of the visit.
How much notice should be given will be decided in the vote today.
We also believe that there should be a de minimus provision for minor infringements, for petty transgressions: the authorities should not come down too hard in such cases.
You cannot find fault with everything and besides farmers should never be punished twice for something that is covered by both European and national law That would mean paying two fines and we are against that.
An important point in the report - and I think that the Commission is also in favour of this - is that a great many things that are checked by the authorities under cross-compliance are also checked by private industry.
Why should we have two inspection systems?
Why is it not the case that if private industry checks something, then the public authorities say 'fine, we will check the private industry schemes from time to time and if they are good, we do not need to carry out checks on the farms themselves any more'.
That could make a huge difference, also from the farmers' perspective.
I think that could be an excellent form of cooperation with private industry.
To the Commission and Council, we are meanwhile in agreement on abolishing the 10-month rule.
I think that the deadline for submitting applications in the Member States is a guide date for the application for support.
We in the Committee on Agriculture think it is reasonable that the new Member States should also be given extra time to adapt and we have said that if they eventually get 100% agricultural support payments, they must also observe the cross-compliance rules in full.
We do not know what the future of the system will be but we do know that it is incredibly expensive at present.
Would it be possible for the Commission to produce a rough estimate of what it costs to implement it in each Member State, how the cost in one Member State compares with another and how it compares with the total expenditure associated with cross-compliance?
This study could also come up with various options for how it could be done more cheaply through cooperation with private industries.
At a rough estimate there are at present about 18 Directives that farmers have to comply with in order not to have their income subsidies cut. There may be more to come.
There is a soil directive in preparation, for instance.
The Commission should investigate whether it might not be possible to reduce the number, and I do have one or two Directives in mind.
It is ridiculous that we have both a Nitrates Directive and a Groundwater Directive.
The Groundwater Directive says that the permitted level of nitrates in groundwater is 50 mg per litre (if you exceed that, you are liable to penalties); the Nitrates Directive says 1.7 livestock units per hectare.
We should have either one or the other, but not both.
That is too much of a good thing.
One of them must go, and I would say the Nitrates Directive.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her comments this morning and also Mr Mulder for his cooperation on this report.
Last week an RTE television programme (which I once edited and presented) asked the very simple question, 'How many inspectors does it take to examine a farm?'
In the case of one farmer, Eamon Healy of Redcross, County Wicklow, it took seven inspections and nine inspectors in a three-month period to examine his farm!
And I think that, by any standards, that level of inspection is excessive and very unwelcome on a farm that is active and busy.
I think it says a lot about the need to radically alter the way we carry out our cross-compliance checks on farms and also the need to streamline - as Mr Mulder said - the many different types of inspections, whether they are Member State or private industry, or EU-required.
About 68% of cases of non-compliance are considered to be minor, yet they lead to sanctions, and I think we need flexibility around this.
I believe that a sanction of less than EUR 250 should not be imposed.
I know the Commission has other ideas, but I hope it will be persuaded by our arguments.
Over 70% of cases are around the loss of an ear-tag or some minor issue about identification, with no problems or risk to human health or animal health, and I think we need more flexibility around this particular problem.
We need to be proportionate.
I think we do need to give farmers advance notice.
Many are part-time and giving them advance notice allows them to plan for an inspection.
They cannot really alter much on the farm within a short space of time.
So I think we need to be practical.
I doubt very much if Eamon Healy, the farmer I just mentioned, is aware of our debate here this morning.
I do not think he is logged on and listening.
But I know he will be very keen to find out the outcome of our work and our vote.
He does not want seven inspections or nine inspectors on his farm in a three-month period and he is telling us that we need to streamline how we do our work.
I think we owe it to him and to other farmers to get on with it.
on behalf of the PSE group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to thank and congratulate Mr Mulder for his work, and also for his methodology and the various consultations he carried out.
His report on implementation of cross-compliance for agricultural aid has acknowledged a start-up phase in the application of this rather complicated system.
The aim is to increase acceptance by all the main players.
It recommends a distinction be made between matters arising from Community frameworks and those subject to national implementation.
It stresses the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the regulations and demands adapted to risks and local requirements, but also the importance of a common framework guaranteeing European farmers equal treatment.
This dual level of rules has made it extremely difficult to implement the system.
Insufficient information has been provided for farmers; risk criteria have been used very infrequently; the management, control and reduction system is too complicated; insufficient consideration has been given to cases of minor non-compliance; control rates are not harmonised; prior notification of controls poses a problem.
Personally, I do not wish to question the spirit of cross-compliance, which provides a response to the legitimate expectations of our society: respect for the environment, traceability, food safety and transparency.
On the other hand, I do wish to highlight the heavy burden of regulations, the difficulties involved in applying them on the ground and the negative perception some farmers have of them, in the belief that their professionalism and know-how are being questioned.
I therefore wish to point out the need for simplification.
I was disappointed with the Commission proposals, which were very limited, and I hope that Parliament's proposals will be taken over and that the Commission will come up with more ambitious suggestions during the Health Check.
I wish to emphasise that I do not agree at all with the compensation logic that since European farmers are subject to strict production conditions (animal welfare, environmental concerns, veterinary practices) they should receive agricultural aid.
Aid for agriculture would to a certain extent establish a fair playing field as regards competition with farmers in third countries who are not subject to the same production conditions.
However, I feel that it is because farmers receive public aid that they should, in return, respect a number of production rules.
There should be a genuine contract between farmers and the EU.
We must somehow move from constraint to contract.
I am therefore pleased that my amendment on this matter was adopted and that, when the farmer makes his single application and declares the area used for agricultural purposes, he must also agree to comply with criteria relating to public health, animal welfare and respect for the environment.
The reductions in payments must differ depending on whether non-compliance is deemed an intentional act or the result of negligence. I was also keen for the sanction to be proportionate to the importance of the sphere of activity affected by the non-compliance at the farm, particularly where this is a mixed crop and stock farming holding.
Farmers in the different Member States must also be obliged to observe the same rules, and therefore it is important to ensure harmonious transposition of the management requirements set out in the Directives.
I also welcome the adaptation measures for the new Member States.
On the other hand, even though I support the introduction of a threshold above which the Member States may decide not to apply any reduction of direct aid, the de minimis threshold, I am totally opposed to raising this threshold to EUR 250, as proposed in Amendment 16.
If this were the case, most infringements leading to a reduction in aid would not be sanctioned and the cross-compliance system for aid would make no sense.
I therefore ask you to support Mr Mulder's Amendment 31 proposing a threshold of EUR 100, a compromise I feel could be acceptable to all.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I also wish to thank our colleague Jan Mulder for his report today and for his methodology.
I am glad our Parliament is looking into the cross-compliance mechanisms for CAP aid, which have demonstrated since the major reform of 2003 the limitations of a system whose rules are often too finicky, and have transformed the job of farmers into a kind of ad hoc official within the European administration, when they are actually carrying out a mission essential to mankind: feeding us.
The 2003 reform is an unmistakable step forward which ought to help our agricultural sector protect the environment and health, and it was in this spirit in 2005 that we voted in favour of the new EAFRD Regulation replacing the EAGGF - Guarantee section.
I am taking part in the debate today as the permanent rapporteur on the Structural Funds for the Committee on Budgets in order to stress - like many of my colleagues - how important it is to reduce excess bureaucracy in managing these funds.
On the subject of the budget, I feel firstly that it is vital that all players in the agricultural economy and rural development, the main guarantors of environmental protection, reduce useless administrative burdens so that they can focus on their main activity, which is continuing to achieve the quality agriculture we expect, and environment-friendly agriculture at that.
Secondly, I would also like the controls to focus on two matters which are extremely useful in guaranteeing a suitable cost-profit ratio.
I feel it is vital that the rules we make do not hinder use of the available credits for which we fight so fiercely at each round of negotiations with the Member States in the Council.
It is not normal to see such under-use of appropriations at the end of 2007.
I thus intend to vote for all these measures to the extent that they endeavour to reduce the administrative burden.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I should like to express our support for Mr Mulder.
The concern underpinning the report has been to ensure that the principle of cross-compliance and its associated controls do not penalise farmers unjustifiably.
Agriculture is not simply one more economic activity.
It has a specific social role.
Payments conditional on fulfilling many environmental requirements are not only beneficial to farmers but also to society as a whole.
This broad social role of payments should constantly be emphasised.
A significant sector of society is unaware of this role and it should be explained to them.
I should like to make a very important point.
We require our farmers to abide by the principle of cross-compliance. We impose conditions on them.
We should impose the same conditions on those who export their agricultural products to Europe.
In particular, the requirements concerning animal welfare should be imposed on all imports without exception. Economic and humanitarian interests require this to be the case.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, a word of thanks, first of all, to the rapporteur, who certainly took a great deal of trouble, even if the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development did not adopt all of his proposals. I regret that.
I do not intend to go into detail now but to say in general terms that the compulsory requirement is, of course, compliance with the law.
The new feature, following the severance of the link between production volumes and aid, is that this compliance with the law is now the basis for the payment of premiums.
Those who do not take the premiums cannot have their premiums cut.
Growers need only refrain from applying.
Nevertheless, they still have to observe the law.
Mrs McGuinness, when you speak of seven inspections and nine inspectors - or vice versa - you should be taking up the cudgels with your own national government, for it is up to the Member States to determine how inspections are conducted, and if you have no coordination because numerous different administrative bodies are responsible for enforcing particular laws, and each authority sends its inspectors separately, thereby imposing endless burdens on farmers, that is not a matter for the EU but for your own national tier of government.
Sort that out, and everything will be fine.
I believe there is an urgent need to make these funds conditional.
At the congress, we heard someone say these were farmers' funds.
No, they are not farmers' funds: they are granted to farmers.
Do not misunderstand me: it is right that these funds should be awarded, but it is also right that society expects them to be given to those who fulfil certain conditions.
I have just had an inspection myself.
Two people came, having announced their visit.
Although they did not let me choose the time of the visit, they did announce it; they duly arrived, and it went very smoothly.
Of course, Commissioner, these inspections should also be used to develop an advisory service to help farmers by informing them how best to comply with and apply the law on their farms.
That, as you know, was set in motion back then on the initiative of Parliament, so the possibility exists.
Please make it compulsory for the Member States, and then we shall be one step further forward.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, theoretically the common agricultural policy was meant to guarantee food safety, stability for EU production and prices, and also a decent income for all farmers.
Unfortunately, in the name of the dogma of savage competition, CAP 2003 and its aid decoupling system constitute another step towards abandoning these objectives, even though they are vital European components.
Single payment entitlements contribute to the serious difficulties in sectors such as wine, milk, meat, beetroot, fruit and vegetables.
The entitlements' environmental cross-compliance principle is nothing more than a trick devised to sell this reform to Bohemians who pass themselves off as environmentalists merely because it is fashionable to do so.
How can we possibly imagine it is possible to increase our protection of the environment by stimulating competition in the agricultural sector and bringing down the prices of foodstuffs at the same time?
The two requirements are contradictory: it is impossible to combine lower production costs with an increase in environmental regulations.
In the same way, the immediate consequence of decoupling the premium for maintaining suckler cows would be the disappearance of the natural carbon-absorbing meadows, which are particularly effective in combating greenhouse gas emissions.
Protecting the planet and maintaining production of quality European beef mean that decoupling must be rejected.
In a more general context, what we actually need is another agricultural policy.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the rapporteur's explanatory statement is instructive in that it depicts cross-compliance as a condition for continued public support, and tells us that farmers are now being paid for 'complying with Community legislation in the field of environment, public, animal and plant health and animal welfare'.
It further states that such regulations are very strict compared with standards in the rest of the world.
That neatly encapsulates everything that is wrong with the EU's attitude to agriculture, with an aggressive regulatory regime diverting farmers away from their natural ambit of producing food and turning them into guardians of the environment, or what this report calls rural development policy, all of which adds mightily to their costs and reduces output.
It has also had the effect of putting farmers into direct competition for funding with establishments such as country parks and wildlife preserves, which would not naturally be their competitors.
I am aware that the intention of this proposal is to simplify cross-compliance, because it is openly admitted that it has created a heavy, bureaucratic burden for farmers and for Member States to enforce.
It is my contention that it was a bad idea in the first place, and simplifying it is to merely administer a band-aid rather than a cure.
As usual, in EU parlance, 'simplification' means more standardisation and more control by the Commission.
Again, the major differences inherent in agriculture across the wide diversity of climates prevalent in the EU do not lend themselves to such standardisation.
This report enthusiastically trumpets the view that cross-compliance is an important instrument in justifying public support for farmers.
I doubt that even one per cent of the public would have heard of cross-compliance, never mind understand what it means.
For real simplification, let us do away with cross-compliance altogether and let farmers get on with what they do best, which is to grow crops and rear animals.
Madam President, farmers are not unreasonable people, nor, as a rule, are they dishonest, yet cross-compliance often treats them unfairly, with disproportionate penalties for minor offences and no-notice inspections.
We have heard that 68% of all cases of non-compliance are classified as minor, yet the sanctions imposed are too often, for the struggling farmer, almost crippling.
Disparity in how cross-compliance is administered from country to country compounds the resentments which it has built up in some.
In my constituency of Northern Ireland, we have had a particular problem with duplicate fields, arising from our conacre system.
Instead of a pragmatic search for a solution, we have had heavy-handed rigidity.
Much of the blame lies with the local Department of Agriculture, but it, and Brussels, could each have done more to resolve that problem.
So, going forward, my plea certainly is for simplification and flexibility, and a good dose of good, old-fashioned common sense to replace the inflexibility of some over-zealous mandarins.
Madam President, first of all I would like to welcome the report today and congratulate the rapporteur on his work.
Cross-compliance and how it is implemented at Member State level are crucial.
We must not allow each other - and each and every Member State - to make their own interpretation.
If you listen to what Ms McGuinness and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said this morning, it shows the difference in interpretation in different Member States.
We have got to get it right at Member State level, and we have got to insist that each Member State implement this directive in the right and proper way in each and every Member State.
Farmers need and require less inspection, not more.
When inspection happens, there must be sufficient notice before inspection occurs.
It is madness, in my opinion, to fine any farmer for the smallest detail; this is already happening.
Farmers should be allowed a period to put right any problem that is identified, not just be told that they have defaulted and will be penalised.
There is a great need to reduce bureaucracy and red tape in farming.
Cross-compliance must not become a system that allows farmers to be penalised and policed.
We should be there to help farmers and to offer advice on how they can do things better.
Cross-compliance could be a force for good, and those who do the inspections should have clear and proper training and know their responsibilities.
Yes, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is right.
I had an inspection at my farm which lasted seven hours.
The only thing they could find wrong was that one little part of it was no longer considered to be arable land and we had built a poultry unit, which we did not inform them about.
Now, really, an oversight as simple as that - building a poultry unit on your farm and not having informed them within the 12-month period - I do not think is something that you should actually be penalised for.
You should be allowed to put it right at the earliest possible moment.
(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think Mr Mulder's report makes an admirable effort to improve agricultural policy in Europe.
Agriculture is attracting ever-growing interest in Europe.
Bearing in mind that half the surface area of the European Union is given over to agriculture, I believe that conditionality represents one of the most important political signals explaining the desire to confirm our support for the farm sector, while making that support dependent on respect for the environment.
I should like to emphasise the way in which these rules connect with our citizens, with consumers: we have here a very significant means of raising awareness about a subject as topical as environmental protection.
I endorse the rapporteur's efforts to simplify conditionality: indeed, in my opinion it is counterproductive to demand excessive efforts of farmers to comply with legislation.
By introducing new issues such as climate change, biofuels, water resources and risk management, the Commission has demonstrated its wish to move forward, even though some ambiguity still surrounds the way in which conditionality is to be handled, if it confines itself to laying down a generic requirement for simplification without clarifying how - and to what end - it is to be implemented.
Elements such as simplification, deregulation and - I myself would add - transparency must always underpin any initiative emanating from the European Union.
I shall stop there but, Commissioner, I am aware that ten days ago you visited Brescia, in my own province, and - even if this is not quite germane to the current debate - you were able to taste the wines and typical products of Brescia: I believe that not adding sugar to wine is a means of striking the right quality balance and fairly rewarding producers.
(GA) Madam President, guaranteed EU support to farmers should be provided under the common agricultural policy for the years 2007 to 2013.
And that is why I cannot accept that Commission should attempt to scale down this guarantee by means of its recently announced 'Health Check'.
The Commission is seeking to cut back the amount of direct payments to farmers to less than 13%.
This breach of the guarantee is, to my mind, unacceptable because farmers have entered into set-aside arrangements for those years and it would not be right to go back on them.
As regards standards, what I would say is this: if they are to be enforced throughout the EU, they should apply equally to the food brought into the EU - and farmers all over Europe should not be subjected to pointless checks.
We should look at the standard applying to the food that we allow into Europe, and the Commission should take action, instead of bothering farmers, who are doing their best in all parts of Europe, and that certainly includes my country, Ireland.
(RO) Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our colleagues, rapporteurs and fictive rapporteurs, who undertook the difficult mission of presenting before us this package of complex amendments that are essential for the future of the common agricultural policy.
It is obvious that the very high number of European regulations and directives that farmers must observe renders their access to the aid schemes more difficult.
The rules of the single payment system must be simplified as regards conditionality.
The legal basis allows the application of the minimum rule for reduction of payments, as well as for exemptions from reduction in the case of minimum infringements.
Fewer administrative obligations, harmonized examinations, combination of examinations, including at the level of European institutions, and payments made in due time would improve the overall assistance provided to farmers, thus increasing the efficiency of the common agricultural policy.
It is also necessary to provide increased assistance for preparing inspections, which, in my opinion, should be announced with limited duration and performed by adequately trained people.
Finally, in the case of Bulgaria and Romania, as new Member States, I consider the extension of the optional nature of articles 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 until 2013 to be judicious, as far as the provisions of these articles refer to statutory requirements in matters of administration.
(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, all types of agricultural activity and production should comply with the requirements concerning environmental protection, safety, quality and animal welfare.
Mr Mulder's report contains many important provisions in that regard.
I would ask the Commissioner to focus in particular on four amendments, namely Amendments 19, 26, 27 and 29.
If the cross-compliance system is to be properly implemented in the new Member States whilst also responding to society's expectations, it will have to be introduced in stages.
The full range of requirements should only come into force in those countries in 2013, when they begin to receive full direct payments.
We should bear in mind that the financial perspective 2007-2013 does provide resources to enable holdings to adjust and for investment.
Commissioner, the requirements and standards imposed on our farmers are stricter than in third countries.
We need to support our farmers and protect them from unfair competition.
Imported products must comply with the same production process standards as Union products.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank the Members very much for all their contributions to this debate.
You will know that cutting red tape, and making things more simple, have been at the top of this Commission's agenda from the very beginning.
That was why, when we opened this debate on cross-compliance, we commissioned from RambÃžll Management a report on simplifying the CAP that was specifically linked to cross-compliance.
It is a limited study which only covers five different Member States, but it is very interesting and I will supply you with a copy.
It shows, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf rightly says, that there is a huge difference between Member States. The way in which the cross-compliance system is implemented in Member States is different.
So, as was rightly said, the role of the advisory system is crucial.
I think we should use this study for further discussions, within the health check, on what we can do to simplify the cross-compliance system without watering down the ideas underlying it.
This is a first step, along with the discussion in Council and the Mulder report, but it is not the final step.
Let us continue with the health check to see what might be done, and use all the available information.
This report will be worth looking into to see what can be done, what Member States can do, and how Member States can define best practice among themselves, in order to find a solution in which there is a level playing field.
Thank you for the discussion.
I am sure we will return to this matter again.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL) I welcome the postponement of implementation of the expensive requirements relating to cross-compliance for the new Member States (the so-called new Ten).
This is certainly justified.
The countries concerned are not yet receiving the full direct payments that already represent the lion's share of all expenditure on agriculture in the European Union.
I also welcome the extension of the possibility for the new Member States to benefit from Single Area Payments (SAPS) from 2010 to 2013.
This will avoid placing a heavy and unnecessary burden on the new Member States in connection with implementation of the Single Payments System (SPS).
This is a move in the right direction, but we should not allow it to obscure the serious situation concerning the distribution of resources between the old and the new Member States.
According to the most recent information available, dating from 2005, the new Member States have received EUR 1.5 billion in direct payments. This is 21 times less than the old Fifteen.
The beneficiaries, however, only received 2.4 times less (EUR 2 million and EUR 4.9 million respectively).
These enormous differences are also reflected in the average payments received by each beneficiary.
For the new Member States it amounted to EUR 723, whereas for the old Fifteen it was EUR 6 327, which is almost nine times more!
Ongoing discrimination against the new Member States is detrimental to farmers in those countries.
It also calls into question the very spirit of the common agricultural policy and the development of agriculture across the whole of the European Union.

rapporteur. - (EL) Madam President, I would like to thank all the Members for their support in the drafting of the report.
I am delighted that it is unanimously being brought for a vote in plenary, but this cannot stop us from speaking out strongly against the recasting procedure which the Commission chose for this particular proposed directive.
This report is very important because it aims to provide a sound basis for the distribution of fruit trees, so that they are certified and safeguarded in terms of plant hygiene in order to protect the farmer, the consumer and the environment.
It is of paramount importance that the producer should be able to obtain healthy propagation material, both to prevent the spread of new diseases and to protect his income, and also to reduce the use of pesticides, which are, as we all know, so harmful to the environment.
This is why we tabled a number of amendments.
Let us not forget that with the enlargement of the European Union to 27 countries, the movement of goods became easier, simpler and free of red tape.
This conceals dangers.
We must be careful because the movement of plant products without inspections poses the risk of the spread of diseases, with disastrous consequences for the environment and for the economy.
To conclude, I would like to reiterate my opposition to the recasting procedure, which prevents us from making improvements where we consider them necessary.
I believe this policy is dangerous, especially if the Commission chooses it in future reforms of other proposed regulations and directives.

Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted for the report by Ieke van den Burg on 21 November 2007, and the Council took a decision along the same lines last week.
This is not the first time that we have had to make an urgent statement on these matters, and we wish to lend the Commissioner our support in his bid to achieve a stabilised system.
In this regard, however, we are taking the opportunity afforded by the report to transmit some very clear messages.
The first is that we need to determine whether or not the idea of definite arrangements based on the country of origin is still the aim of the European Union.
We also need to offer the Member States more flexibility in the use of lower rates for goods of basic necessity for social, economic, cultural and environmental reasons.
We must also offer the Member States space to use lower rates in terms of political objectives.
Finally, we need to authorise lower VAT rates to assist labour-intensive services.
Parliament is willing to play its part and will support the Commissioner in his determination to find a viable solution to this issue.

Award of the Sakharov Prize (Formal sitting)
Honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, for almost two decades the European Parliament has been awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to men and women from all parts of the world who campaign for human rights, freedom of speech and freedom of expression.
I am delighted to bid a very warm welcome today, here in the European Parliament, to the winner of the Sakharov Prize for 2007, Salih Mahmoud Osman.
(Applause)
It also gives me great pleasure to extend my warmest greetings to his wife, Salwa Ahmed Faragalla Ali, who has always stood by his side at difficult times in his life.
We welcome you among us.
(Applause)
The decision to award the 2007 Sakharov Prize to Salih Mahmoud Osman was taken unanimously by the Conference of Presidents, which comprises the chairs of the political groups, on the basis of a proposal adopted by a large number of Members of the European Parliament from various groups.
The European Parliament has thereby reaffirmed its solidarity with the people in Darfur and its conviction that a sustainable solution for that region can only be achieved through justice, democracy and respect for human rights.
The conflict that has plagued Darfur since 2003 is exacerbating the plight of a country devastated by more than twenty years of civil war.
As with most conflicts, it is the civilian population who have suffered most from militia raids, the destruction of villages, scorched-earth policies and forcible displacements.
The conflict has claimed at least 400 000 lives and has been responsible for more than two and a half million displaced persons and refugees, notwithstanding the signing of the peace agreement in Darfur in 2006.
Just like the European Parliament, the winner of the 2007 Sakharov Prize does not simply accept this unjust situation but protests against the impunity of those who caused it.
For years Salih Mahmoud Osman has been defending the rights of victims of the conflict in Darfur.
Thousands of people who have been imprisoned without trial, tortured and exposed to death threats, who have been driven from their homes, displaced or subjected to sexual violence are familiar with the name of Salih Mahmoud Osman.
His commitment is remarkable in several respects.
In a country where violence is constantly on the increase, Salih Osman risks his life on a daily basis in the cause of human dignity and justice.
In the name of human dignity, Salih Osman reassures those destitute, defenceless and intimidated men and women who have sunk into oblivion that the world is aware of their suffering, that they have not been forgotten and that they have reason to hope for a return to a perfectly normal and simply human life.
Since 2004, Salih Osman has been committing himself to the establishment and administration of the Amal Centre in Nyala, amal being Arabic for 'hope', for the rehabilitation of victims of violence and sexual abuse.
In a predominantly Muslim country, Salih Osman is one of the few men who campaign actively in support of women's rights and especially for recognition of the right to compensation for victims of sexual violence.
In the name of justice, Salih Osman strives, day after day, to ensure that those responsible for war crimes are held to account both nationally and internationally.
While the Sudanese judicial system still has many defects that make it unable to put an end to the prevailing climate of lawlessness within the country, international jurisdiction seems to offer an alternative.
The fact that the Sudanese authorities are refusing to hand over alleged war criminals to the International Criminal Court, however, highlights the limits of international justice and shows how much progress is still needed before the rule of law can be established in Darfur and throughout Sudan.
That is why Salih Osman's work is not confined to the legal aid he gives the victims.
As a member of the Opposition in the Sudanese Parliament since 2005, he does not hesitate to affirm his convictions in the Sudanese political arena and to engage in efforts to bring about genuine reform of the legal system.
At the meeting between the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament on the eve of last weekend's EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon, I had the opportunity and the great pleasure to meet Salih Osman.
I was immediately impressed by his strong personality and his unbending will to fight for human rights in spite of all the persecution and hostility to which he and his family have been subjected.
I learned a short while ago that Ali and you have three children, who are also very much in our thoughts today.
In 2004 Salih Osman himself was imprisoned for seven months without being charged, and it was only when he went on hunger strike that he was released.
Members of his family have been tortured and murdered or have had their houses set on fire by the militias.
The great German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once wrote, 'Knowing is not enough; we must apply.
Willing is not enough; we must do'.
Salih Osman embodies that kind of will and determination, showing his courage in his daily struggle on behalf of his fellow human beings.
He is an exemplary campaigner for greater respect for the rule of law in his region.
Salih Mahmoud Osman, you have our firm support and our warm acclaim.
As you know, the European Parliament has always been particularly receptive to the suffering of the African peoples.
Salih Osman is one of a number of African prizewinners to whom Parliament has given its support in past years and whom it continues to support.
Nelson Mandela was awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1988, Salima Ghezali in 1997, Dom Zacarias Kamwenho in 2001 and Hauwa Ibrahim in 2005.
Salih Osman, we congratulate you on your untiring work in this cause, in this spirit, and we hope that the recognition this prize brings might grant you strength and protection from year to year for as long as your struggle continues.
We are at your side.
(Applause)
Sudanese lawyer acting for the victims of the war in Darfur. - Mr President, thank you for this tremendous honour.
This prize is awarded as a unanimous vote of the European Parliament - a fact which gives me great satisfaction, but more importantly one which gives me the opportunity to speak to you today.
I am a native of Darfur, born in Jebel Marra, which is a mountainous region located in the centre of Darfur State.
I have worked as a lawyer in Darfur in Sudan for many years.
I have been a victim of detention and torture because of my work.
Members of my own family have been tortured and displaced by the militia in Darfur.
For many years, in my work, I have represented thousands of people who needed my help in front of the Courts.
I have seen thousands of people who have been tortured; I have seen hundreds of women and young girls who have been victims of sexual abuse; I have seen the four million who have been forcibly displaced from their homes and those two and a half million who are confined, as we speak now, in the camps around the cities of Darfur: Nyala, Al Fashir, Zalingi and Al Geneina.
The UN Security Council has adopted several resolutions related to the situation in Darfur.
Unfortunately, none of these has been implemented effectively.
The victims feel disappointed.
They are waiting to hear from you; from the people of Europe.
Your leaders have been talking tough about the policies of the Sudanese Government in Darfur.
But so far we have not seen any concrete steps to address the situation in a strong and targeted manner.
As a representative of the victims of the conflict, today I have an unprecedented opportunity to speak directly to the leaders of Europe.
The people of Darfur need the European Union to show a strong, united position regarding protection of innocent civilians.
The people of Darfur ask you to protect them from the violence, killings and abuse they are forced to face on a daily basis.
The people of Darfur want you to protect their children and women from acts of rape and sexual violence, which are being used as 'weapons of war'.
This protection can be made possible through the deployment of the UN-AU hybrid force.
The involvement of international, and especially European, forces is imperative, even though the Government of Sudan may be unwilling to accept that at the present moment.
But Europe has a role to play in putting more pressure on the Government of Sudan to facilitate the deployment of these troops and the protection of the people of Darfur.
Now, in Darfur, and in Sudan, I tell you there will be no peace without justice and without protection.
Peace can also be facilitated by Europe.
The European Union has a great responsibility to promote peace internationally.
The leaders of Europe have the ability to lead the peace process also in Sudan.
I ask you to increase your efforts in bringing the rebel groups and the Government of Sudan to the table of peace negotiations as a matter of urgency.
But the fact is that rebel groups are splitting among themselves, and this does not help the situation in Darfur.
I want you to think about taking on board other stakeholders: the millions of victims who are voiceless in the camps and other, directly affected people of Darfur.
Take on board also the civil society movement, NGOs and community leaders.
That would help the situation in Darfur.
Even if we can provide protection and promote peace in Darfur, justice and accountability must not be compromised by any political deal.
Presently, none of the victims can return to their houses or homes, because of the absence or lack of security.
Not only are our communities being attacked by militias, but even helicopter gunships of the Government of Sudan are destroying our villages in aerial bombardments.
Despite these serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, none of the perpetrators has been brought to justice, because the Sudanese judicial system is incapable, incompetent and unwilling to provide justice.
All the perpetrators are beyond the reach of our domestic justice.
This conflict is one which is marked by a culture of total impunity.
As a lawyer, and a native of Darfur, I know that there can never be a lasting peace in the region without justice.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has made some important and significant steps in promoting accountability.
Yet, the cycle of impunity has not yet been broken.
The people of Darfur ask you to support the work of the ICC.
The ICC is the most competent international criminal tribunal which can make the many notorious perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity accountable for their actions.
Right now, the two identified suspects Kosheib and Haroun are still beyond the reach of justice.
The Government of Sudan is insisting that it will never hand them over to the ICC.
Darfur is not the only region of Sudan which suffers from abuses of human rights.
Indeed, citizens from every part of Sudan face daily restrictions on their freedom of expression, freedom of association and other basic rights that many people in Europe take for granted.
I urge you, also, to encourage and promote the rule of law in my country, so that all citizens of Sudan can enjoy their individual and collective rights.
In the light of the upcoming elections in 2009, we must ensure that free and fair elections take place, and that a free and fair result will be respected by all sides.
Lastly, I would like to thank you, the Members of the European Parliament, who came to Sudan in June of this year to see with your own eyes what I have described.
This was a visit coordinated by the office of the European Commission in Khartoum.
The office of the European Commission has been a source of great support and a partner to me in my work for many years now.
The recognition of the European Commission and of you, the European Parliament, for the work of human rights defenders in Sudan gives us the courage and determination to continue to speak for the victims, and relieve some of their suffering.
In conclusion, I am proud to accept this honour on behalf of the other candidates to this prize: the Russian journalist assassinated last year, Anna Politkovskaya; the Chinese dissidents, Zeng Jinyan and Hu Jia; and the Afghani MP and women's rights activist, Joya Malalai, and also on behalf of so many Sudanese who believe - as I do - in human dignity and the pursuit of justice.
Thank you so much.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
Ladies and gentlemen, may I ask you to stand, or remain standing, for the European anthem in honour of Salih Osman.
Explanations of vote
in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Costa on amendment of the agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on certain aspects of air services. This relates to a proposal for a Council decision on agreeing a Protocol amending the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on certain aspects of air services to take account of the accession to the European Union of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Romania.
The Protocol provides for essential changes to bilateral agreements on air services between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Romania pursuant to the accession of the latter two countries to the European Union.
Both Bulgaria and Romania had previously concluded agreements on air services with Morocco, in 1966 and 1971 respectively.
The European Community, however, concluded a horizontal agreement in December 2006.
It is therefore necessary to adjust the agreements to Community legislation and enable both new Member States to accede to the horizontal agreement.
in writing. - (RO) The Romanian Members of the European Parliament from the Group of European Socialists abstained from voting on the report regarding the agreements between the EC and Georgia, Lebanon, Maldives, Moldova, Singapore and Uruguay on certain aspects of the air services due to the reference, in the text of the Agreement with the Republic of Moldova, to the Moldavian language in the phrase "Concluded in Luxembourg in two counterparts in the Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovakian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish and in the Moldavian languageâ.
The delegation of Romanian Social Democrats emphasizes that Romania's participation in this agreement does not involve the acknowledgment of the designation of "Moldavianâ language.
The Romanian Members of the Group of European Socialists reiterate that, in compliance with the factual and scientific evidence, including the interpretation of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Moldova (of September 1994), the correct designation is the Romanian language.
It is necessary to take into consideration the fact that, in many other agreements, the Commission has used the neutral wording "Concluded at...... in ........ day of ........... of the year ............ in two counterparts in each of the official languages of the Parties, each text having equal legal powerâ.
We regret the fact that this wording was not used in the agreements with the Republic of Moldova and recommend the use of this neutral wording in the official documents regarding the EU relationship with the Republic of Moldova.
in writing. - Briefly I want to raise through my support of this report the problems still being experienced by EU airlines in regard to rights to fly over Russia.
These rights are not only restricted by the Russian authorities but they are also expensive, issued in a discriminatory way, and in a manner that clearly disadvantages EU carriers, particularly those flying a number of routes to the Far East.
This problem has been known about for some considerable time but the unwillingness of the Russian authorities to renegotiate with the EU on this issue has been both expensive and unhelpful.
We now need the Commission and the Russian authorities to reinvigorate their efforts to find a solution to this very serious problem.
in writing. - (DE) Even though various reactor accidents occurred many years ago, we are still paying the price of past mistakes.
Immediately after nuclear accidents, things like game, berries and mushrooms are temporarily removed from our menus, only to reappear after a short while.
It is important to set restrictive maximum permissible levels, but there is still a shortage of studies on the effects of radiation on humans, just as the emerging field of genetic engineering has been insufficiently researched.
The EU must devote itself without delay to these important and urgently awaited impact studies, make preparations for the abandonment of nuclear energy and leave it to the Member States to take their own decisions on the use of genetic engineering.
Since the aforementioned points were not adequately addressed in the report, I abstained.
in writing. - The common organisation of the market in fisheries products is intended to ensure stability in the market and security of income for those involved in the sector.
These aims and, indeed, the aims set out in the EC Treaty are worthy and should have led to prosperity in Europe's fishing communities.
Unfortunately the past two and a half decades of centralised Brussels control in the form of the CFP have been disastrous for those communities.
A thriving market with job security are not achievable within the context of the CFP and control of fisheries management must be returned to the nations dependent on fisheries.
in writing. - (SV) I voted against the report because it deals with provisions for the common agricultural policy, which we want to abolish.
The common agricultural policy needs to be radically reformed, and for a few years now we have been calling for a discussion to start as early as possible.
We think that the EU should already start to cut back on agricultural support in 2010, after the so-called health check on the long-term budget for 2007-2013.
This is why the Junilistan Members are usually unable to vote for the various reports on agriculture which come before the European Parliament.
in writing. - (EL) Plant hygiene and the certification of propagation material for fruit-bearing plants and fruit trees are of the highest importance for the producer because the initial establishment of an orchard, when properly accomplished, is a guarantee of good produce.
Undoubtedly the legislation needs to be adapted to developments in the sector.
However, although we agree with most of the amendments to Mr Gklavakis's report, we have reservations and disagree with those amendments which accept genetically modified propagation material, even as rootstock, because it poses risks to human health and the environment.
As yet there are no scientific studies guaranteeing that there are no effects.
As regards imports from third countries, we agree that there should be no deviations because there are risks of the spread of pathogens in the European Union, with repercussions on production, product quality and agricultural income.
in writing. - (PT) We defend the application of the principle of subsidiarity.
As a result, we agree that the Community should not impinge upon Member States' competence.
This is the case, for example, with locally supplied services which do not involve cross-border activities and therefore have, in principle, no effect on the functioning of the internal market.
As a result, in the area of indirect taxation and as regards the setting of VAT rates, each State must be totally free to act.
Even if the Council decides on a definitive system for the taxation of intra-Community transactions, Member States should be able to apply reduced rates or possibly even zero rates to goods and services which meet basic needs, such as food and medicines, and also to locally supplied services, including services and provision of goods linked to education, welfare, social security work and culture.
Even if a definitive system for the taxation of intra-Community transactions is decided by the end of 2010, Member States should be able to apply reduced VAT rates in order to reinforce the existence and maintenance of locally supplied services as well as their role in the formal economy.
in writing. - (FR) For once we were tempted to vote in favour of a report on VAT by this Parliament.
It favours abandoning the aim of definitive arrangements based on taxation in the country of consumption, and this objective alone justified the increased harmonisation of rates.
It also favours applying the principle of subsidiarity, which would allow the Member States to apply zero VAT to services provided locally, such as catering or other aspects, as a solution to social, educational and cultural aims etc. It also seeks to maintain many derogations which should have terminated in 2007 until 2010.
We agree with all this.
However, we cannot agree with the desire to maintain European legislation on VAT and the wish to secure identical rates whatever happens, in the name of simplification of trade and customs formalities for intra- EU trade.
Taxation is a sovereign responsibility of individual countries, and the disparities concerning one type of tax often offset inequalities in another.
They are not, therefore, always illegitimate.
in writing. - (PL) In the context of the ongoing debate on transitional VAT rates, the European Parliament was asked for its opinion regarding extension of the temporary provisions concerning these rates.
We are today voting on this opinion.
It somewhat belated, as we are aware that the European Union has decided to continue applying preferential VAT rates after 1 January 2008.
Nonetheless, I believe this is a very important opinion.
It certainly is the right decision for the countries that joined the Union in 2004, and we fully endorse it.
Parliament's opinion on the subject is unambiguous and advocates retaining certain temporary provisions concerning VAT rates.
The decision merits broad support.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the van den Burg report on VAT.
The report highlights the importance of the subsidiarity principle in taxation matters and, correctly I believe, states that the principle should apply where services have no cross-border element and accordingly have no impact on the internal market.
in writing. - (FR) The Commission can never get it right on the subject of VAT.
In the 1980s the Cockfield Report called for a range of VAT rates.
In fact, there was only a minimum rate of 15%, 5% as the normal rate and the lower rate.
Then the European Commission wanted VAT at the rate applied by the country of origin.
In practice VAT was levied at the rate applied by the country of destination.
It was a provisional system that became a definitive system: the so-called 'Bolkenstein VAT' was not introduced.
There were now lower rates of VAT for French catering entities, CDs and activities generating a workforce.
The Commission gave in at least provisionally in its list in Annex H to the Sixth Directive in 1977, because it realised that Germans could hardly drive their Mercedes to a cross-border lunch at the low-VAT restaurant.
What a shame it did not realise in 1993 that with no border controls intra-Community VAT was an inexhaustible source of large-scale fraud.
The philosophical logic of VAT, an intelligent tax since it is economically neutral, is inaccessible to the vast majority of Commission officials.
That is why their legislation has failed constantly on this issue for the past 20 years.
I would like to draw attention to the two amendments that I proposed and that have been approved in the final report.
The first proposal states that every country should have the right to apply reduced rates of VAT or, in exceptional circumstances, possibly even zero rates to basic goods and services, such as food and medication, for social and environmental reasons and for the benefit of the consumer.
The second proposal states that it should be possible to apply reduced or even zero rates of VAT to goods linked to education, social security and culture.
At present, reduced rates of VAT can already be applied to goods linked to education.
This amendment reinforces this.
I appeal to the Council of Ministers to follow the European Parliament's policy.
in writing. - (PT) Our abstention on this report is due to the doubts surrounding the establishment of ARTEMIS, its functioning and its management.
The formation of joint undertakings in the context of public-private partnerships, as is the case with the establishment of ARTEMIS in order to implement a Joint Technology Initiative, as set out in this report, includes the idea of using public funds for private purposes and interests, whereas cooperation in the other direction, either financial or involving the transfer of knowledge, seems to be absent.
In this context, the objectives seem to be contradictory as the private initiative pillar is founded on the accumulation of profits whereas the public service pillar is founded on the service of public interests and on the response to the concerns of the population.
However, investment in research, particularly in the area of integrated IT systems, is a contribution which we regard as essential for the development of technology in Europe.
in writing. - (PL) Madam President, ARTEMIS is the first of four proposed joint undertakings with a joint aim and justification.
The others are Clean Sky, ENIAC and Innovative Medicine.
All four enterprises even have a joint headquarters in Brussels, which remains a joint capital for the Fleming and Walloon peoples.
Parliament's Committee on Budgets expressed its support for the four new institutions provided for under the Seventh Framework Programme.
It did so in the hope that the public-private partnership model devised for them will prove more realistic than was the case for the Galileo Programme.
It should be noted, however, that the time frame and budgetary arrangements for ARTEMIS and the other joint undertakings (2008-2013) are not in line with standard financial arrangements laid down in the seven-year financial perspective 2007-2013. This could give rise to certain problems in the future.
We also noted the relatively low figure allocated to administrative costs in the breakdown of total expenditure on the four joint undertakings, namely EUR 84 million for the years 2008-2017.
This represents around 3.5% of the total expenditure and substantiates our concerns.
The question of proliferation of institutions within the framework of the European Union remains open, however, and does not only involve the institutional reconstruction of the Seventh Framework Programme.
(SK) The Innovative Medicines Initiative is a unique initiative instigated by the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, which will have a budget of EUR 2 billion to 2013.
That is why I also voted in favour of the report.
I am convinced that this partnership between the private and public sectors will help to speed up the distribution of better and safer medicines.
I am happy that the Innovative Medicines Initiative will improve research conditions and with them the chances of developing better medicines for the treatment of neglected diseases.
Secondly, as a member of the small and medium-sized enterprises association I am thrilled with this first public-private partnership, which includes funding for cooperation between small and medium-size enterprises, universities, research centres, academies and associations, which are members of the EFPIA.
This method of financing will at last provide access to the required resources and thereby create a favourable environment for research in the European Union and increase its competitiveness.
Our Member States should expect results....
(The President cut off the speaker)
(CS) Mr President, I am one of the critics of the lack of cooperation between large corporations and universities and I also object to the low level of resources available for research within the EU, due to the fact that, compared with the US, only one third of funding here comes from the private sector.
Today at last we are sending very good news from Strasbourg to the European research industry by adopting a seven-year plan for innovative medicine at the cost of EUR 2 billion.
The format of this undertaking is innovative in itself as it represents a partnership between the private and public sectors.
This can double the available resources and also helps to unify research targets.
I believe it will give a fresh impulse to knowledge management, education and vocational training.
I am convinced that we can reverse the trend of falling efficiency in the European pharmaceutical industry and achieve a more easily accessible high-quality treatment, especially of cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for getting the report to its successful second reading.
in writing. - (FR) In my capacity as rapporteur I am very pleased with the adoption of this report on setting up an Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI).
Implementation of this public/private partnership between the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries' Associations (EFPIA) and the European Commission represents a major promising step forward for large-scale research programmes.
The European Commission is duty bound to consider European needs from another angle.
The IMI will have a total budget of EUR 2 billion between 2008 and 2013.
The European Commission's contribution of EUR 1 billion will be disbursed to SMEs and universities.
In return, major companies will match this amount with a contribution in kind.
They will involve the SMEs and universities by providing them with tools and methodologies to better predict the harmlessness and effectiveness of medicines, intelligent infrastructures and knowledge management.
This cooperation between leading businesses, small-scale research centres, SMEs and universities will help fashion their research projects.
IMI will also make improvements to knowledge transfer at universities and in business, and to the involvement of smaller companies in European research.
in writing. - (PL) The subject of innovative medicines is particularly close to my heart, because I am actively involved in Poland with helping children suffering from rare genetic diseases.
Unfortunately, these children are not covered by any health insurance programmes, and the medicines they require are too expensive.
In most European countries, the cost of the medicines needed to keep such children alive and give them the opportunity to live near-normal lives is refunded.
As a Member of the European Parliament, I realise how important a European approach to the whole issue of medicines is.
I refer to innovation, Union support for research and for scientists, and also to Union encouragement of pharmaceutical concerns, urging them to develop new medicines.
In my opinion, the report by Mrs GrossetÃªte is very important indeed.
I agree that the Union must change to a new and more effective method of managing research and innovation aimed at promoting the economic development of our continent, bringing relief to our citizens and even saving their lives in some cases.
The European Commission's proposal to create joint technology initiatives will harmonise and simplify project financing.
With regard to research programmes on innovative medicines, it is important to involve SMEs, universities, patients, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry, to ensure that medicines are safer, cheaper and more readily available.
The public-private partnerships proposed by the Commission are therefore an excellent solution. They represent a new option for the pharmaceutical research sector.
in writing. - (ES) The Spanish Socialist Delegation voted in favour of the Ek report on the creation of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking, but I wish to make it clear that the basic principles of openness and transparency must be strictly observed in all Joint Technology Initiatives.
In particular, with regard to Clean Sky the Spanish Socialist Delegation has always supported the need for open and competitive invitations to tender to ensure equitable access for participants in all the Member States on the basis of excellence.
In view of all this, the Spanish Socialist Delegation wishes to place on record that the Clean Sky undertaking must not constitute a precedent for future Joint Technology Initiatives or for other instruments of the Seventh Framework Programme, and considers it is essential that all the Member States participate on an equal footing.
in writing. - (PT) As European citizens, we enjoy a series of rights, including the right to diplomatic and consular protection.
All EU citizens may be protected by the diplomatic and consular authorities of any other Member State where their country does not have an embassy or consulate in the territory of a third country.
This issue is even more relevant if we consider that there are only three countries - China, Russia and the US - where all the EU Member States have diplomatic and consular representation.
In addition to the fact that the representation of Member States in third countries can differ widely, there are also cases where this representation is non-existent (such as the Maldives).
I support this initiative which aims to ensure that the provisions of Article 20 of the EC Treaty and Article 46 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights can be effectively used in practice, by laying the foundations for a genuine harmonised fundamental right to diplomatic and consular protection for all EU citizens, regardless of their nationality.
The establishment by the Treaty of Lisbon of a European Foreign Service with its own competences and responsibilities is also positive.
Agreeing that it is essential to inform the people, I support the establishment of a single European emergency telephone number which will enable EU citizens to obtain the information they need, particularly in critical and emergency situations.
in writing. - I voted in favour of the Varvitsiotis report, which seeks to enhance diplomatic and consular protection for EU citizens living or travelling in countries in which their home Member State does not have representation.
My own country, Scotland, does not currently have independent diplomatic representation anywhere in the world.
I believe that situation is likely to change in the next few years, and I look forward to Scotland's overseas representatives being there for all EU citizens in time of need.
in writing. - (DE) The case of Muhammad the teddy bear has brought home to us once again how easy it is to get into a tight spot in a foreign country.
It does not always take a natural disaster, an accident or the loss of a passport; a cultural misunderstanding can be enough.
We still have a great deal to do in this area.
In Turkey, for example, an applicant country for accession to the EU, life can be dangerous for Western travellers, since - as a very recent study demonstrates - the oft-proclaimed improvement in the protection of minorities exists only on paper, and the situation on the ground has actually deteriorated.
Two things, therefore, need to be done.
The first is to establish a sound network of diplomatic missions that can serve our citizens as an anchor, and the second is to ensure that the travelling public are not only aware of an ambassador's responsibilities but also know that they can seek assistance from the embassy of any EU Member State.
In the light of these considerations, I voted for the envisaged action plan.
in writing. - (PL) There are only three countries in the world where all European Union Member States have diplomatic and consular representation, namely China, the United States and Russia.
There is no representation whatsoever in certain popular tourist destinations.
Pursuant to the Commission's initiative, every European citizen is entitled to diplomatic and consular protection from any other Member State with a representation in a third country on the same conditions as the citizens of that other Member State.
This is only relevant, however, when the home Member State has no embassy or diplomatic representation in a third country.
I am in favour of such a solution.
Unfortunately, in view of the content of the second part of this motion for a resolution, I was obliged to vote against it.
Mutual practical diplomatic and consular assistance in the broadest sense of the notion must not involve assuming the competences of any other Member State.
Regrettably, that is what the motion for a resolution aims to achieve.
in writing. - (PL) I abstained in the vote on diplomatic and consular protection for citizens of European Union Member States.
Clearly, however, I would like such protection to be provided.
On 11 September 2007 the Belgian police beat up and arrested Mr Borgheio, a Member of the European Parliament, in front of the European Parliament's building even though he identified himself as an Member of the European Parliament and informed the police about his parliamentary immunity.
This incident shows that it is not necessary to seek out third countries to appreciate that the protection provided is not as good as it could be, even in the case of parliamentarians.
I believe we should first deal with the situation in our immediate vicinity.
in writing. - (PT) This seventh Amending Budget for the year 2007 includes a further EUR 4 324.8 million in revenue and also a decrease of EUR 1 651.4 million in expenditure, thus allowing the Member States to reduce their contributions to the Community budget by around EUR 5 976.2 million.
While the increase in revenue is largely due to the VAT and GNI balances, budgetary under-implementation is mainly responsible for the significant reduction in expenditure, with the cuts essentially affecting the headings of cohesion, fisheries, environment and agriculture.
The late adoption of many operational programmes of the Structural Funds for the 2007-2013 period (and others) is the justification given by the Commission and by the Council for not using the appropriations forecast for 2007.
However, these amounts are not transferred to the 2008 budget to respectively boost the appropriations for these policies.
It is noted that the amounts forecast in the 2008 Budget for these headings are within those agreed in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013.
The non-implementation of these amounts in the Community budget is very worrying and should be very closely monitored given that 2007 is the first year of the new financial framework 2007-2013 and that Rule N+2 is still being applied in relation to the previous financial framework within which the appropriations must be fully used by 2008.
in writing. - (PL) We are living in the 21st century, and have no option but to adjust to new and fast-changing circumstances.
That is why I warmly welcome the report by Mr Heaton Harris on the introduction of a paperless environment for customs and trade.
The provisions of this document are very relevant to modern Europe and should be introduced as a matter of urgency.
They refer to the tools with which to create a new generation of working environment in customs and trade.
I refer to the establishment of a paperless environment, which is so necessary mainly to relieve our officials, who are reeling from the demands of unnecessary administrative paper documentation.
We should also keep in mind issues pertaining to environmental protection and the quantities of trees that have to be sacrificed to meet the demand for paper required for this purpose.
I consider the introduction of electronic customs systems to be particularly important and urgent.
I also advocate the creation of 'Single Window' and 'One-Stop Shop' facilities.
I am convinced Europe should invest more in this type of solution, to ensure that the statements in the Lisbon Strategy become more than empty words.
in writing. - (CS) We are now confronted with a serious problem of trying to control the immense volume of imported goods, mainly from Asia.
Solving this problem requires customs systems that are electronic and interconnected.
Electronic trade and customs have already become a necessity for an efficient European market, even prior to the introduction of the modernised customs code.
I would like to point out that we also need a system capable of intercepting goods which do not conform to the European safety standard and preventing such goods from entering the EU.
The text we adopted today will provide for much more effective control of imports.
It also has the advantages of a single window and a one-stop shop, which will provide access to information on international transactions not only for customs authorities but also for suppliers, buyers and hauliers.
No doubt this system will also be used by the national supervisory bodies responsible for controlling the safety of goods on the market.
The Commission has slowed down the implementation of the system into three stages to be introduced in 3, 5, and 6 years.
I am afraid, however, that much faster action is needed and I hope that the Commission will soon be pressurised to revise its decision.
(LT) I am glad that the Baltic Sea, the most polluted sea in Europe, has been selected as a pilot area for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.
The Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council leaves implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive to the Member States, having drawn up an integrated framework for marine policy in the Baltic Region.
Nine countries in the Baltic Region are EU Member States and there is only one third country - Russia.
There are substantial doubts as regards improvement of the Baltic Region's environmental status 2010.
These doubts arise because of the plans to develop the Russo-German gas pipeline across the whole of the Baltic Sea.
We will all suffer the consequences of the construction and exploitation of this gas pipeline.
The sea water will be used for testing the pressure in the gas pipeline; afterwards it will be pumped back into the sea.
In addition, chemical weapons from the Second World War lurking at the bottom of the sea also represent a danger.
I support the document; nevertheless, I find it hard to visualise the integrated EU framework for improving the environmental status of the Baltic Sea.
Moreover, in my opinion, we should involve Russia in the development and implementation of this framework.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mrs Lienemann's recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive).
The compromise reached between the European Parliament and the Council will enable a framework to be established for the protection and preservation of the marine environment, the prevention of its deterioration and, where practicable, the restoration of that environment in areas where it has been adversely affected.
in writing. - (PT) Today we adopted the recommendation for second reading on the common position establishing a Framework for Community Action in the field of Marine Environmental Policy.
Bearing in mind the economic, social and environmental aspects, it seems fairly important to have a policy for the marine environment with the necessary cooperation and coordination between the various countries, while all retaining their full sovereignty over their territory and resources.
However, the central issue is respect for the sovereignty of the Member States, particularly over their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and their capacity to adopt independent measures to protect their resources.
As a result, we cannot forget that the proposed 'Reform' Treaty contains a clause which aims to give the European Union exclusive competence for the management of marine resources within the common fisheries policy.
Furthermore, it must also be taken into account that marine pollution and intensive maritime transport impact on fishing activity and the protection of marine resources.
Fishermen are therefore the first to be interested in protecting and regenerating marine resources.
As a result, measures to ensure recovery of stocks must include measures with adequate financing in order to offer economic and social compensation to the sector and its workers.
in writing. - (FR) I voted against this report, which encourages the Member States to take the necessary measures towards 'good environmental status' in marine affairs by 2020.
The marine environment hosts vital resources and its ecosystem provides essential services such as climate regulation and oxygen production.
Policies concerning maritime transport, fishing, energy or even tourism have evolved separately, occasionally leading to failures, inconsistencies or usage conflicts.
A more global approach was necessary, taking account of all aspects of a sustainable development policy for Europe's marine environment.
The Member States must devise strategies for the marine environment in a number of stages for waters falling under their sovereignty.
By 2015 these strategies ought to produce a programme of measures designed to achieve good environmental status.
Member States sharing the same marine region or sub-region will have to cooperate to coordinate the various components of marine environment strategy.
Work must continue with the creation of marine parks, as highlighted by the Grenelle Environmental Forum.
The report provides for the creation of protected areas, but it could have been more restrictive.
in writing. - I was able to support the compromise package reached across this house on the Lienemann report on the marine environment.
It is essential for future policy in this area that a holistic and balanced approach is taken.
The Common Fisheries Policy perhaps serves as a template for how not to nurture the marine environment.
Central control from Brussels is no way to manage the seas and oceans of Europe and the wider world.
I therefore recognise that the EU has a valuable role to play in marine environmental policy but also believe that the needs and views of individual maritime communities must be factored into the equation.
(PL) Madam President, I voted in favour of this report as a representative of one of the eight countries most directly concerned and fully aware of what is involved.
I did so because in Poland there is a significant concentration of particles, in excess of the permitted daily and annual levels.
Silesia is the area most affected. It is the most industrialised region of the country.
I consider this to be a step in a very positive direction as regards protecting the environment in my country in general and in Silesia in particular.
(CS) (The beginning of the speech was inaudible) ...and cleaner air for Europe is a very good example of the way the Union works.
The joint undertaking is based on Article 251 of the EC Treaty.
This Directive simplifies the legislation, replaces several other Directives and also stipulates the permissible levels of small particles in the air.
It is the result of a consensus between political groups as well as between countries.
Moreover, it is an example of a sensitive approach to the delimitation of competency in this area between the Union and the Member States.
I appreciate the work done by the rapporteurs and I am happy that we have adopted this modern Directive, which simplifies and underpins our high ambitions in this area.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mr Krahmer's recommendation for second reading on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe.
I did this because I consider that the text negotiated between Parliament and the Council is generally positive, both in terms of protecting public health and in terms of environmental protection.
In Europe, 360 000 people die ten years early due to air pollution.
Studies show that the effects of air pollution particularly impact on children's health which is why air quality plans must include measures to specifically protect vulnerable population groups such as children.
in writing. - (PT) The natural resource of 'air' is every day becoming increasingly polluted, mainly in urban centres and regions of EU Member States with the highest population densities.
Air pollution is harmful to human health, in terms of diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and also to ecosystems.
We know that children, the elderly and people living in the most populated and congested urban centres and also those living close to major traffic routes are particularly vulnerable.
The European Parliament has today expressed, at second reading, its position on the Council common position on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe.
The text of this common position includes some of Parliament's proposals that we tabled at first reading.
However, there are some points on which the Council's position is immovable; for example, it does not accept any changes to the provisions regarding daily and yearly limit values.
For its part, the European Parliament intends to defend three main points of its position: the setting of more ambitious target and limit values; more flexibility in the adoption of stricter measures at source, and the establishment of long-term goals.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report.
Of all the types of pollution, air pollution is the main concern of 54% of the French population.
It is therefore important to supply daily information to the public, particularly people with allergies, on the particles suspended in ambient air.
As Chairwoman of the Loire departmental air quality network since 1991, I am extremely pleased that regulations have been introduced for finer particles, often the most harmful, which had hitherto not been covered. This will allow us to take better consideration of the upsurge in respiratory illnesses such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.
Preservation of the quality of exterior air must not neglect air in closed spaces, where we can spend over 80% of our time.
Little importance is attached to the studies on air quality inside buildings, although it certainly has at least the same impact on our health as exterior air.
This new Directive means that the Member States will also have to set up particle sampling points in urban areas.
This measure follows the same lines as our work in France with the Grenelle Environmental Forum.
in writing. - I supported the compromise package reached by the various political groups on the Krahmer report on air quality.
Air pollution causes serious health damage across the EU, leading to many thousands of premature deaths.
The compromise package will introduce monitoring obligations in relation to certain fine particles and, hopefully, marks a step in the right direction in improving the quality of air and, accordingly, the quality of life for European citizens.
in writing. - I voted for this report not because I believe it makes the major step forward we need in tackling air quality, but because it is at least some advance, despite the attempt of some in Parliament to weaken this protection.
We are now recognising the importance of tackling smaller particulates, which are so damaging to people's health, and have avoided increasing implementation periods.
Local authorities have a vital role to play in the implementation of air quality directives, and these standards need to be borne in mind when considering new developments - such as airport expansion or new road infrastructure near schools or hospitals.
in writing. - (NL) The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted today for the agreement on air quality, in which strict standards are agreed for particulate matter.
By 2015 a maximum of 25 micrograms of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) will be permitted.
It has also been agreed that certain areas with high concentrations may be given an extension if they can demonstrate that they have done everything they can to improve air quality and they have an effective source control policy in place.
That is very important for the Netherlands, as it will mean that construction projects are not brought to a standstill.
This will allow the protection of public health and the environment to go hand in hand with economic development.
All the same, the ALDE Group considers that the target of 20 micrograms of PM2.5before 2020 in the compromise is unfeasible.
It would be wiser to wait for the evaluation date of 2013 before setting later targets.
in writing. - (PT) The goal set by this report is to improve the interoperability of the Community rail system or, in other words, to increase the possibility of obtaining authorisation for a train from one Member State to travel through another Member State.
Aside from the other important aspects considered in this respect, including certain technical aspects, the fundamental aim of this directive is to remove all obstacles to the movement of 'Community trains'.
It should not be forgotten that this report fits within the strategy of liberalising (and privatising) rail transport in the EU.
As we have seen in other Community legislative initiatives on transport, as well as in this one, the main objective is to remove all obstacles to the liberalisation of international rail transport, in this case by removing, through harmonisation, any different rules or requirements applied to rolling stock in each country.
Finally, it must be pointed out that the harmonisation and simplification of the national authorisation procedures and the principle of mutual recognition should never override more appropriate rules established at Member State level or remove the prerogative of each Member State to lay down such rules.
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Ortuondo Larrea report on the recast of the Interoperability Directive, for interoperability is the key to revamping our European railway system.
Rail transport, in fact, can only become competitive again - compared with road traffic in particular - if it moves up to a continental scale, and this mainly depends on the ability of trains to cross borders.
Even though the administrative obstacles have been largely removed, we are still left with some very real technical obstacles.
Thus I am very glad that this text was agreed at first reading, since urgent progress must be made in this field.
The text, which now makes rail interoperability a political priority, should represent a great leap forward for European railways.
in writing. - (PT) The report on which we have voted today on the interoperability of the Community rail system is most important as an incentive for investment in rail transport and is vital for creating genuine freedom of movement in the European territory.
The measures proposed to facilitate the interoperability of locomotives in the Community are measures for which we have all been waiting.
In order to create a European area of transport without borders which genuinely encourages the free movement of people and goods, we must create the necessary conditions so that a journey from Lisbon to Helsinki is viable on all modes of transport.
Rail transport must be able to develop as a fully fledged partner in order to achieve the objectives of the common transport policy.
We cannot forget that this is a safe and environmentally friendly means of transport that enables the transport of large quantities of goods and passengers.
It is a mode of transport that is at the forefront of the fight against the negative effects of air pollution, dangers on the roads and road congestion.
I therefore voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Mr Ortuondo Larrea.
in writing. - I welcome initiatives that might help to improve rail systems throughout Europe in a substantive way.
The East of England is crying out for improvements in both passenger and freight capacity and greater use should be made of opportunities for TEN funding for the lines serving east coast ports.
However, there is another aspect to this matter and that is the through-running of trains from the continent and the opportunities this might give illegal migrants.
The report aims to boost the free movement of trains through the removal of technical and operational barriers.
There is no consideration of the security aspects.
There were major problems at the Frethun rail freight depot in Northern France which impacted on Channel Tunnel operations until, in 2002, additional security was introduced.
Given the absence of consideration of this matter, I abstained on the report.
in writing. - (SV) We voted for the Commission's proposal for a directive.
We think that there is a need for common provisions on systems of direct support and that it is a positive move to replace a system in which support is linked to production with one in which, for example, rural development, open landscapes and quality are the main focus.
We support the Commission's proposals for simplifications.
A simplified procedure is a way forward if we are to gain the acceptance of the farmers themselves.
Unlike the committee, we consider that controls are also important in order to give the system legitimacy in the eyes of the EU taxpayer.
However, the controls must be proportionate to the circumstances which they aim to bring about.
The regulatory systems should be organised in such a way that they do not lead to misunderstandings.
in writing. - (PT) We do not agree with the opinion expressed in the report on scrapping production aid in favour of a single payment scheme for producers based on a history of their production, thus forcing them to meet the objectives of the cross-compliance system.
This system has led to production being abandoned by many small and medium-sized farmers and family farms and to rural areas being abandoned, to losses of biodiversity and to a reduced chance of achieving the goal of food sovereignty in certain Member States, particularly Portugal.
However, we agree with the need for more information in the agricultural sector so that this can adapt to the cross-compliance rules.
We also feel it is vital to provide adequate training for those carrying out inspection of farmers' activities and that inspectors should have the discretion to take into account unseasonal and sudden factors which mitigate against full compliance with the requirements, due to no fault of the farmer.
The importance of agricultural activity should be taken into account as farmers provide a genuinely public service to society.
That is why support measures must be maintained, including the timely payment of aid.
in writing. - (SV) The amendments made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to the Commission's proposal are good in part and very bad in part.
Junilistan agrees that it is now too difficult for individual agricultural businesses to understand the content of the EU's various directives and regulations on agriculture.
Simplification is absolutely essential.
But I object to the proposed text of the Committee on Agriculture to the effect that there is no real place in the system for unannounced checks 'as they contribute to a disproportionate but valid sense of fear'.
There must be effective checks when public funds are paid to individuals.
We cannot compromise on that, yet this is what the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament wants to do for some reason.
I have therefore chosen to vote against the European Parliament Resolution on this matter.
in writing. - (EL) The simplification and reduction of bureaucracy is desirable, but here it is being used as a pretext for more policing of farmers.
Multiple conformity is therefore an extremely hypocritical notion because it knowingly overlooks substantial issues relating to the environment and public health, such as GMOs, and places particular emphasis on matters of only minor importance.
As regards animal welfare, this is an excuse for serving external interests, mainly those of the transport companies, at the expense of stock breeders and consumers, since the cost is being increased with no substantial benefit to the community.
Overall, multiple compliance, without any substantial benefit to the environment, public health or the health of animals, for which purposes it was supposedly introduced, has placed a heavy financial burden on farmers and stock breeders.
In our country, the costs of compliance for livestock facilities are intolerable for goat and sheep farmers, with negligible benefits for the environment, public health and the health of animals, although these are areas where the problems can be dealt with effectively if production methods are suited to the physiology of animals and plants.
If, for example, a ban is placed on GM crops, meat meal, mineral oils and hormones, and systematic checks are carried out for pesticide residues in agricultural products, then the results for public health and the environment will indeed be much better.

Draft general budget 2008 as modified by the Council (all sections) (debate)
The next item is the report by KyÃ¶sti Virrankoski and Ville ItÃ€lÃ€, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2008, amended by the Council (all sections) and on Letters of Amendment No 1/2008 (13659/2007 - C6-0341/2007) and No 2/2008 (15716/2007 - C6-0435/2007) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2008.
rapporteur. - Mr President, as rapporteur I would like to warmly thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr BÃ¶ge.
It is to his merit that the outcome, following conciliation, is so well-balanced.
I would like also to thank Mr Virrankoski, my fellow rapporteur, for his great cooperation during the budget procedure.
I am especially glad that Mr Virrankoski made possible the pilot projects in support of the sustainability of the Baltic Sea.
My main objective as rapporteur for the budgets of Parliament and the other institutions was to keep any increase as low as possible.
That is why I named this budget 'the taxpayers' budget'.
That objective has been achieved, and the increase has been kept to below 4%.
(FI) I just wish to remind everyone that paragraph 48 in the motion for a resolution concerns Article 29 of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
The administration has requested, regarding this, that we should send a letter to all the governments of the Member States, asking how they want Members to proceed if they are re-elected with regard to the Statute for new Members.
I hope that my amendment concerning this gets through and that this matter gets dealt with via the quaestors, because that is the right way to go about this.
As there has also been a public debate on this issue, I would like to say that this Article 29, decided by the Council, means that the governments of the Member States take a decision whether to apply the old rules or the new rules to re-elected Members.
It is not the case that Members themselves are free to make this choice.
Moreover, because this is a matter for the quaestors, it is only right that they should also decide whether to send this letter.
Mr Virrankoski now has the floor for another two and a half minutes, also in his capacity as rapporteur.
rapporteur. - Mr President, excuse me, but do I have two and a half or five minutes?
My note from the secretariat tells me there are two rapporteurs and they have two and a half minutes each.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a joint debate with two reports and one rapporteur speaking on each report, as happens on other occasions.
This is one report with two co-rapporteurs, and so they both share the five minutes.
In any case, Mr Virrankoski, please take the floor and attempt to provide a summary.
As all the Members know, I am quite flexible with speaking time, and so I would ask you to start the debate because we have already lost one and a half minutes with this interruption.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the grand total for the European Union's budget for next year is EUR 129 149 700 000 for commitments and EUR 120 346 800 000 for payment appropriations.
Although this is an increase of 5.71%, the payments are just 0.96% of GNI, i.e. EUR 9.3 billion under the multiannual financial framework.
Parliament's unconditional priority has been heading 1: sustainable growth and competitiveness.
Parliament did much to promote financing for the two-year project for the Galileo Positioning System and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
In this we succeeded.
The Council agreed to a revision of the multiannual financial framework so that the Galileo project might be financed entirely out of the EU's budget.
There was a gap in the financing of EUR 2.4 billion when the private sector pulled out.
Parliament insisted on the gap being filled with money from the EU's budget.
There was no longer any question of carrying on in this vague and fragmented way.
A choice had to be made in this budgetary procedure: either to continue with all the resources needed or end it immediately.
Fortunately for Europe, the Council chose to continue.
For this we are grateful to the skilled work of the Portuguese Presidency.
For the funds needed we took EUR 1.6 billion from this year's unused agriculture expenditure, and EUR 200 million from the flexibility instrument, and the rest we obtained by prioritising and reallocating expenditure from heading 1a.
Rescuing the Galileo project was a huge victory for Parliament in this budgetary procedure.
Another significant achievement was the promotion of the EU's external actions.
For that, EUR 70 million was obtained from the flexibility instrument.
All this is needed for such operations as preparations for the police service in Kosovo and the continuing difficult challenges concerning Palestine, and getting ready to launch these operations.
The Committee on Budgets has created a special reserve to boost activity-based management.
This is something which will be returned to in the resolution.
A particular problem is management of the Structural Funds.
More than half the operative programmes are still unapproved.
It is important that they should be approved right away.
Finally, I wish to thank in particular the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency for their excellent work. The same goes to Commissioner Grybauskaitfor her constructive approach and initiative.
I also want to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr BÃ¶ge, all the coordinators and all Members.
My thanks also go to the office holders on the Committee on Budgets and those in my own group, who were able to produce good results in drawing up the budget under all the pressure of a tight schedule.
With these words, then, I leave the budget for Parliament to deliberate upon in its plenary session.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Virrankoski, and please forgive the misunderstanding, which may have caused you to rush your speech a little through lack of time.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be taking part in your debate on the second reading of the budget for the year 2008.
I have listened carefully to the first two speeches and should like to express my thanks for the words of praise on our joint work.
As usual, the budget procedure for 2008 was extremely complex and I am delighted to note your intention to fully respect, in the budget for 2008, the agreement reached between our two institutions at the budget conciliation meeting on 23 November 2007.
This agreement had two different but equally important objectives: firstly, to define the framework for establishing the budget for 2008 in order to allow the European Union to function properly and its policies to be correctly implemented; secondly, to ensure the financing of Galileo, one of the most important projects undertaken by the European Union in recent years on a political, industrial and financial level.
In this context, please allow me to express my great pride at the leadership role played jointly by the European Parliament and the Council, as budgetary authority, with the support of the Commission, in the overall agreement reached on the Galileo project.
On 23 November 2007 we managed to reach agreement on a Community budget consistent with such a vital project, thereby speeding up the approval of all its other legislative and technical aspects.
This financing decision was undoubtedly a decisive step in launching the Galileo project towards its final orbit.
In addition, I should like to express the Council's satisfaction at the agreement that we have reached on the budget for the common foreign and security policy for 2008.
This is an extremely important political priority for the European Union.
Also, I believe that the budget for 2008 as a whole represents a balanced compromise between, on the one hand, the need to ensure the necessary budgetary discipline and solid financial management and, on the other hand, our duty to meet the expectations of European citizens.
Please allow me to add that this satisfactory result was only possible thanks to the synergy between the efforts of all those involved and the excellent and constructive climate which, in our opinion, characterised this whole process from the start.
As a result, I could not end my speech without taking advantage of this opportunity to personally thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Reimer BÃ¶ge, for both his frankness and the spirit of dialogue that he showed during the negotiations, and also the two rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr ItÃ€lÃ€, for their constructive interinstitutional cooperation.
I also want to express my gratitude to my colleagues on the 'Budget' Council, and to all those who cooperated with them, for the firm support that they gave the Presidency.
My special thanks go to Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaite who fully played her role as neutral mediator and, last but not least, I should also like to thank the staff of the three institutions who took part in these negotiations for their very valuable and professional contribution.
