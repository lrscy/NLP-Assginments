Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Langenhagen, the GALILEO project is technologically interesting and already has a lot of potential applications.
Up until now we have had the similar Russian and American systems, but these were designed and developed and are also operated from a military perspective.
The American system does in fact hold the real danger that in times when the USA is using it for military purposes the Europeans and all civilian users will be switched off, as actually happened during the Gulf war!
The GALILEO project is now being presented as a civilian project that will make the European Union independent from the USA in an important field of technology.
In my group, too, opinions on the GALILEO project differ widely.
But we are united on one point: we want it to be used for purely civilian purposes.
We have tabled amendments that are designed to ensure its exclusively civilian use.
Mr Rack, I am neither naÃ¯ve nor do I believe there are only good people in the world.
But if we do not do this, we will have the same problem as with the American system, namely that when it is being used by the military it will be switched off for civilians.
You are not solving the problem you are claiming to want to solve.
Secondly, I also have concerns about finance.
A total of EUR 1 730 000 000 of European taxpayers' money is to be spent on development, validation and construction.
Industry wants to join in the construction phase, contributing EUR 1.5 billion, but so far only EUR 200 million have been committed.
That is 13%. From a business point of view, no company could afford to develop something with such a poor equity position.
I think it an impertinence that you want to pay for this out of public funds!
Thirdly, there is another aspect to this GALILEO project.
The Americans allow the GPS to be used free of charge.
You want future users to pay for the European system.
Where do you think that will land you with your much-vaunted competition?
Competition works like this: if I am being asked to pay for something that I can get free somewhere else, I am not going to pay, and you won' t get any users.
Then you will have thrown all that taxpayers' money away!
Mrs Langenhagen, you described this so beautifully as a confection, and Mr Savary used the word historic!
This historic confection will cost a total of EUR 3.2 billion.
I think that is much too expensive for the present time and at this stage!
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the development of a European satellite radio navigation programme raises various questions that warrant our consideration.
This is a project of global scale, that uses cutting-edge technology and involves vast amounts of public and private financial resources.
The strategic importance of political decisions which must be taken for the project to a large extent explain the hesitation that the Council has shown, despite the commitment and enthusiasm that both the Commission and the European Parliament have demonstrated in their statements and in the documents they have drafted.
In fact, the problem is not insignificant.
First of all, because a project of this scale requires close international cooperation.
This cooperation is fundamental, not only because of the future installation in various parts of the world of control centres and communication equipment to support the around thirty satellites that will also have to be sent into space, but also because the success of a project of this nature clearly depends on its interoperability with other, existing systems: the North American GPS and, to a lesser extent, the Russian GLONASS.
It therefore makes no sense to base the argument and the need for a system such as GALILEO on a vague feeling of suspicion in Europe and amongst Europeans towards the United States due to the situation of near total monopoly that that country currently enjoys. And which could cause it unilaterally and for no plausible reason, in other words irresponsibly, to stop data transmission via satellite, or to introduce unacceptable levels of signal degradation affecting the accuracy of this data for civilian users.
The GPS system and the radio navigation by satellite that this allows have been used successfully by the whole world, particularly in Europe.
It should be added that reception of GPS signals has been completely free to users and any member of the public can access the necessary sectors at an affordable price.
The reasons that the European Union must use in its definition 'Development, installation and use' of a system of this type are, of course, quite different.
They chiefly concern the boost that GALILEO would give to the European high-tech industry and providers of related services, thereby introducing an element of healthy economic competition in this sector of activity, which is crucial to its development.
This system would also provide enormous assistance to the development of European technological potential and to improving the associated academic and applied research.
We must also emphasise the invaluable contribution that a project of this scale would make to the creation of new jobs - more than one hundred thousand - and we are talking about highly qualified posts.
And, lastly, the installation and use of the system would enable the development of a public or private partnership of enormous strategic value to support sectors as important as transport (maritime, air or terrestrial), air traffic management, search and rescue, meteorology, mobile telephony and so many others.
It is for all of these reasons, which I have briefly summarised, that we give our support to the GALILEO project, in the hope of thereby contributing to the construction of a genuine Europe of the future.
Madam President, Mrs Langenhagen predicts a rosy future for the GALILEO satellite system.
This is understandable, based on her line of thinking.
However, I, coming from a critical stance, can see major drawbacks to this project.
The calculated costs of this project are more than considerable, especially now that the contribution of the private sector is not clearly marked and secured at all.
Despite the fact that, according to the Commission, only 150 km of high-speed link can be built for the funding initially required, any amount is too high if it does not yield clear advantages.
In this case, the advantages should mainly be in the field of reliability and price.
As things stand at the moment, it is very likely that GALILEO will become a facsimile of the existing system, at least in terms of functionalities.
Despite the civil line of approach, the system will also boast a military component in time.
I have no doubts about that.
This brings to an end the advantage which GALILEO would have compared to existing systems, namely to be independent from military use and more reliable as a result.
What remains is a situation in which we obtain the same services at higher costs.
However, the most important aspect to us is that the system could play an unwelcome role in the relations between the European Union and the United States of America.
Especially in a military context, it has appeared more than once that the European Union produces little without the United States.
Not only does stirring up trouble in the relationship with the United States not make any sense, it is also very dangerous.
That is why I am in favour of accepting the existing offer and not deluding potential users with illusions.
For it is very much the question whether the use of satellite signals will be better and more efficient than it is at present.
Mr President, have you noticed that, not just the Commissioner, but the president and the rapporteur are also women, a coincidence which I think augurs well for the future of GALILEO, even if he was a man.
So, having congratulated the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, I should like to make a point of repeating the view that, at every stage in the design, implementation or application of the system, the political decisions will need to be discussed and taken at European Union level and at that level only, although the role of the candidate countries will, of course, also need to be determined.
It is equally obvious that international collaboration with the United States and Russia is essential, not just in order to reduce the huge costs but also because the question of frequencies can be regulated so as to guarantee reliability by ensuring that enough frequencies are available for GALILEO to provide a broad range of services.
Of course, we need more information on the organisation, administration and funding of the implementing agency, with integrated, realistic proposals, mainly as regards private investment.
At least, from the information available to date, there appears to be no particular drive to attract private investment, given that we have not yet clarified if the system will provide services in return for a fee, which it will need to do if there is to be private investment, or free of charge, so that it can compete with GPS, which provides its services free of charge.
Finally, is there any chance of Member States being called upon to pay large sums of money from their national budgets so that the initial appropriations are not lost?
I think the Commission should give a prompt response here.
Similarly, we must push ahead and resolve outstanding issues, by which I mean technical issues, such as incorporating EGNOS and the corresponding financial analysis and lawyers, both at Community and national level so that we can make any deliberate interference in or distortion of the system a crime and set up an authority to decide when to impose sanctions.
We trust that, one way or the other, GALILEO will progress more quickly now.
Madam President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Langenhagen, for her work on the report.
I am taking the floor today because I feel we need technical systems that offer environmental benefits.
Technical progress is ever more rapid.
Personal computers and mobile telephones have drastically altered our working lives and our everyday life.
We have also seen how technology is changing all the time and creating new aids and how companies are forever developing new products to be used within different areas of society.
A European satellite navigation system can, in fact, mean major opportunities for developing the transport sector, especially when it comes to combined transport, dovetailing different types of transport.
For aviation and shipping, too, as well as for transport by road and rail, the new technology can be used to make transport more efficient and environmentally friendly.
I do agree with the rapporteur that GALILEO will enable Europe to be involved in developing a new technology-based industry and to be in the vanguard of this.
There is a space industry in various parts of Europe today, for example in northernmost Sweden, and I think it important that we should use existing infrastructure to keep down the future costs of this project.
Major technical breakthroughs have more often than not taken place following development using research supported by the public sector, often with a view to the research' s being used for military purposes.
The money and resources needed for developing completely new technologies often do not exist in private companies.
This particularly applies to the GALILEO project which is based upon joint financing by the EU countries but to which the private sector too has to contribute.
What is unique about GALILEO, unlike the GPS system, is that it is being developed for civil rather than military purposes.
I consider this to be an absolute prerequisite for the European Parliament' s supporting the project.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you once again for the European Parliament' s constant and determined majority support for the GALILEO satellite navigation programme.
The resolution contained in Mrs Langenhagen' s excellent report is testimony to this and I thank her for her work.
Please allow me to make some comments on the motion for a resolution based on the Commission' s communication of November 2000.
At the end of June, the Commission sent to Parliament and the Council the proposed regulation on the statute of the GALILEO joint undertaking.
I would like to insist on the importance of this proposal which is intended to establish a single management structure for the programme at the beginning of 2002.
Given that the timetable is so tight, it is essential that Parliament can issue its opinion on this proposal before the end of the year.
In accordance with the conclusions of the Transport Council of last April, we have implemented a study of the services which GALILEO may offer, the income it may generate and the methods for collecting it.
This study must be finished in the coming weeks so that the Transport Council in December may take the decisions necessary for the programme to move ahead.
Of course we will send the results of this study to this House and I hope that those of you who have expressed more reservations about the programme will find that it provides better explanation and greater confidence and that we will therefore have greater support - I know that it is supported by the majority of this House, but also that some of you have expressed significant reticence, if not opposition.
As the motion for a resolution clearly states, international cooperation is essential to the GALILEO programme.
Its objective is to guarantee the interoperability of GALILEO with the existing radio-navigation systems, such as the American GPS or those in preparation, such as the Russian GLONASS.
In this respect - and some of you have wondered whether or not it is necessary - I would like to say that the idea is that they are compatible and that they benefit each other mutually.
Ladies and gentlemen, after what happened last month, the need for a second system which reinforces the existing system and which provides greater security and is, when the time comes, not only a complement, but also an alternative in the event of possible unwanted situations - when we are seeing a huge increase in the applications which affect all the areas of our lives relating to GALILEO - is absolutely essential, not only for Europe, but for the whole world, including the users in the United States.
It is also important that we have the support of third countries so that we might have the necessary frequencies, principally within the framework of world radio communications conferences - the next one being in 2003.
As you know, the allocation of frequencies is due to be consolidated in 2003.
When this happens, it should aid participation in the development of the GALILEO programme.
With regard to the data issued by GALILEO, the international and Community instruments intended for its protection will clearly be applied.
As Mrs Langenhagen' s report stresses, we believe - and this is one of its special features compared to the GPS system - that GALILEO must supply a public signal, that is, a robust and precise signal which cannot be interrupted as a result of military issues, as happens in the case of GPS, and sensitive applications, whether they be public - customs, judicial investigation and so on - or private - such as banking transmissions.
Finally, allow me to sum up the next stages of the programme.
At the end of the year, after receiving Parliament' s opinion, the Council must adopt the statutes of the GALILEO joint undertaking and decide how the programme must continue to be developed by the said joint undertaking in close cooperation with the European Space Agency.
As some of you have said, the green light must be given to the GALILEO project once and for all.
The development phase, which should last from 2002 until the end of 2005, should allow the launch of the first satellites with a view to testing the system in reality and allow the receivers sector to bring those receivers into line.
As you can see, there is still much to do.
Your support is absolutely essential and, in any event, we will keep this House fully informed of all the steps we take in relation to this project.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
Energy efficiency labelling for office equipment
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0298/2001), by Mrs McNally, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on a Community Energy Efficiency Labelling Programme for Office and Communication Technology Equipment (6760/1/2001 - C5-0246/2001 - 2000/0033(COD)).
Madam President, I am very pleased to present my recommendation for second reading on the Energy Star agreement.
As you will know, in a rather complex procedure, Parliament has already been consulted on the agreement itself.
This is now the codecision procedure on the regulation which implements that agreement.
I wish to thank the Commission, the Council and my colleagues, in particular the shadow rapporteurs, for their help in steering through this rather complex procedure.
I would like to thank in particular the Swedish Presidency, which went out of its way to be helpful.
The Council common position takes on board most of the points made by Parliament at first reading.
We shall have an earlier review than was expected; we shall have an update on new technological advances in this area of energy efficiency; we shall have a report to Parliament.
Furthermore, the United States' authorities are absolutely clear that Parliament is involved in discussions on the Energy Star programme from the Commission's point of view.
This has been done through a side letter added to the agreement, at Parliament's request, which meets our wishes for them to know how we operate in the European Union.
This clearly is not the only measure which is to be taken in the area of energy efficiency.
I understand there is an update to the common position because of the new Eco-Label award scheme.
I am prepared, as rapporteur, to accept that slight modification which has been made necessary.
Even though I am pleased that it looks as though this agreement is coming into force, I do not want to exaggerate its importance.
It is a useful tool, but it is a relatively modest proposal; it is a voluntary scheme based on a United States model.
I know many colleagues agree with me that in future we should work as a European Union and have European Community schemes rather than attempting to latch on to schemes developed elsewhere, in the United States for example.
Nevertheless, although it is relatively modest, it is welcome.
Computer equipment is sold worldwide and the educative, awareness-raising aspects of seeing the Energy Star logo on computers is worthwhile.
We know that one of the tasks in increasing energy efficiency is to improve public awareness.
It is a small part of what is needed.
Everyone in this Chamber knows that energy efficiency is the most important component of energy policy.
It is the fifth fuel - coal, gas, renewables, nuclear - the fifth fuel, with a 30% potential, is energy efficiency.
If someone from another planet saw us acting as if we had known that, they would think we were stupid.
We are not stupid, we are intelligent and that is why intelligent energy - a phrase with which I hope everyone is becoming familiar - and certainly Mr Wijkman, Mr Turmes, Mrs Van der Laan and I are doing our best to make it a very familiar phrase - and energy-intelligent Europe depends on energy efficiency.
We look to the Commissioner to bring in a package of measures well beyond Energy Star.
They are demand-side management and two important directives: one on household appliances and one on office equipment - not made in the USA.
I hope that during this autumn, under the Belgian Presidency, we will see both of those draft directives adopted.
We have been very cooperative on the Energy Star programme.
There is only one amendment, which could be withdrawn.
If the Commissioner is able to give us tonight an appropriate assurance and accept the spirit of that amendment, which asks her to take further action on the withdrawal of inefficient equipment, it is quite possible that we can approve the common position unamended.
Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, on behalf of my group for undertaking this technically difficult task and for the tough way she negotiated with the Council, because Parliament' s rights were at stake.
She was in a way having to negotiate a precedent and she showed great commitment and was very successful on Parliament' s behalf.
I would also like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, who over all has worked very energetically for a European contribution to solving our energy problems.
I think we are all agreed that the more efficient use of energy is a very important contribution to solving our energy problems.
Modern technology offers us ways of saving energy and using it more efficiently.
If we do that correctly, it is actually to everyone' s advantage.
The costs of such technical innovations are small enough to be written off within months or a few years at the most, which means it is to the consumer' s overall advantage and it also gives industry an opportunity to bring its innovations on to the market.
Here we are looking at one way, namely the Label.
It is an important step because it gives us influence over world standards since the Energy Star is used not only in the USA and in Europe, but in other countries besides.
When I took on the task of being my group's shadow rapporteur, I asked firms in my constituency that are concerned with the subject, those that sell or make computers, for example, what they thought about it.
They said the Label alone would probably not achieve much because, when consumers buy computers and similar goods, unfortunately they do not pay attention to energy consumption so much as to various other criteria.
So we should perhaps talk about finding other ways of promoting energy-efficient equipment and gradually removing the big energy wasters from the market.
The amendment in front of us says, after all, that one such way forward might be a voluntary agreement with industry.
We should only think about legislation if that fails to work.
I believe that to be very, very important because, as the rapporteur has said, we are debating here about an agreement with the USA and about a Label, but the solution to the problem does not lie in this Label alone.
I am therefore asking the Commissioner to make very clear in her speech that the Commission is thinking of going further and also to say when we can expect other proposals.
I don' t believe any of us would gain from having to engage in a lengthy conciliation procedure because of an amendment being tabled.
If we achieve a good outcome this evening, we can avoid the conciliation procedure.
Otherwise conciliation would be necessary and I am sure we all want to avoid that.
Madam President, on 11 September the world changed, at any rate the world as we knew it.
Suddenly a regulation that has occupied us here in this House for quite some time has become a small pebble in the mosaic of this changed world.
We know that 11% of electricity consumption - between 10 and 15% in other countries - in private households and public sectors - if we add those as well - contributes to power stations being operated completely unnecessarily because there would be other ways of doing it in standby mode.
On a European scale that means between six and ten large power stations, and they could be nuclear power stations.
When at this very moment the first bombers could already be flying towards Afghanistan and people are wondering what form a possible counterattack might take, we can see that such a mundane thing as this regulation could bring us greater security here in Europe, greater security, too - if we think of the consequences of 11 September - in relation to the probable rise in the price of oil.
From this point of view I therefore very much welcome the work that Eryl McNally has done.
The second aspect that should now again be given particular consideration is that we could provide a stimulus to the economy to which the Commission pays particular attention in the amendment to which the previous speaker has already referred - by finding a way not only to label good equipment but also to remove bad equipment from the market as quickly as possible.
Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs McNally for her persistence in keeping this report on Parliament's agenda and bringing it to fruition.
I welcome the approach adopted in this proposal for a voluntary code.
That is a more pragmatic approach towards achieving improvements.
Unlike Mrs McNally I see no harm in adopting measures that are in place in the United States.
It is one of our aims in Europe to achieve common standards in the internal market.
In that regard, why should we not seek to extend those common standards to our major trading partner across the Atlantic?
Just because it was invented in the United States does not mean it is all bad.
It is very important that we should assist people making choices about purchasing equipment in knowing what the energy efficiency is.
In my own experience, labelling materially affects one's decision.
It certainly affected my decision this summer when I was buying a fridge and a freezer for my home.
The old ones were getting very noisy and very expensive.
It may be that my motive was also concern to stop using so much electricity supplied by a company owned by a French utility, but that is another issue.
I should like to close by supporting the comments about the amendment, namely, that we all look to the Commission to give us an assurance on the issue of the further voluntary code.
This is a healthy and sensible approach.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs McNally, for her work in relation to this Regulation.
I am aware that she has worked intensively with Parliament and the Council in order to reach the position we are in today.
I also hope that we manage to reach an agreement on the text which is acceptable to all of us.
I am sure that none of us want to go to conciliation if we can solve the problem in a more appropriate way, given that our positions are very similar.
This proposal is integrated into the Commission' s action plan to improve the energy efficiency of the European Union.
Office communication equipment represents a high proportion of the electrical consumption of the tertiary sector and we all agree that the use of efficient and ecological office equipment can contribute to the sustainable development strategy decided at the European Council in Gothenburg.
The proposed programme for coordination of labelling, the Energy Star programme, will lead to significant reductions in electricity consumption and CO2 emissions, and is therefore very viable.
As Mrs McNally has very rightly said - and I would like to stress that I am in full agreement with her - energy efficiency is key.
The key thing is to use energy well. That is where we have the greatest margins and we stated this in the Green Paper on the European Union' s energy supply.
After a long period of negotiation, in December 2000 the agreement was finally signed with the United States on coordination of programmes for energy efficiency labelling on office equipment.
Now we need this Regulation so that we can appropriately implement what was signed with the United States.
This programme has already been a success in the United States and has led to considerable participation by manufacturers, the large majority of which have introduced energy-saving devices into their products. It has also increased consumer awareness of wastage resulting from office equipment in standby mode.
On the basis of the positive experience on the other side of the Atlantic, the Commission is convinced that the Energy Star labelling programme will naturally lead to the gradual elimination of inefficient equipment on the Community market.
We perfectly understand the European Parliament' s concerns in relation to the effectiveness of the proposed Regulation on this specific point.
These concerns are reflected in the amendment which Mrs McNally is still maintaining.
There is no doubt that in other circumstances I would say that I agree with her. However, on this occasion I would ask Parliament to reject it or, even better, that Mrs McNally withdraw it.
Because, although I agree with its content, I do not believe that this is the right instrument in which to include this type of measure.
The Energy Star programme is not exactly the right place to include this incitement to renovation, modernisation and withdrawal of least efficient equipment.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell the House that we are preparing a framework directive on minimum efficiency requirements in the office communication equipment sector, amongst others, a directive which I hope will be presented to this House and the Council during next year.
I have taken this opportunity to explain the Commission' s position and I hope that Mrs McNally can withdraw her amendment and that we can therefore approve this report on the Energy Star programme today without having to go to the conciliation procedure.
Thank you, Mrs De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy
The next item is the report (A5-0234/2001) by Mr RÃŒbig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy (COM(2000) 567 - C5-0740/2000 - 2000/2336(COS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why is innovation so important for the European Union?
We can all see that we are having slight problems with the economy at the moment.
If we want the economic situation to improve again, we must take initiatives to get employment rising again, take initiatives to get unemployment to fall, and take initiatives to ensure our continuing prosperity in the future.
I believe we also need to be able to assess that objectively.
That is why we should use benchmarking.
I am very grateful to the Commissioner for putting the innovation scoreboard very much to the fore here, too, because it enables us to see very clearly how the various countries are performing.
And, of course, the method of best practice: to see where among our neighbours of the Fifteen in Europe they are working better than in our own countries.
That is how it always was for me at school: you can learn from your better classmates.
And we shouldn' t just stick to Europe, but we should also be looking in particular at the countries that aspire to join us, to see what they are already doing better than we do.
There is an enormous amount of knowledge, a great deal of capacity for innovation, in the technical departments of our universities, as there is of course also in America, Japan, India and many other countries, from which we could benefit.
Innovation must not take place only in the economy, but also in the social, cultural and above all the political fields.
We would very much like to see publicly sponsored research corrected to make it in future even more geared to the market or, it would perhaps be better to say, to the citizen.
Where in future will we find services or products that the citizen would like, that he needs?
Such market research will be very important for us in future if we are to see where our innovation policy needs to be focused.
Innovation also means repeatedly taking risks, however.
We therefore need to ensure that the necessary venture capital is available.
It is especially when times are getting hard that funding runs short.
We all know that Basle II will perhaps bring a further restriction here, too, especially for smaller firms.
Nevertheless - and I would like to correct the text here - we have 18 million SMEs in Europe with fewer than 250 workers.
We need to pay particular attention to them, since after all they generate 80% of the tax yield and employ two thirds of the workforce.
Innovation must start in the small units.
We need subjective innovation; that means combining familiar techniques and technologies, extending them, rethinking where they can be used and where they can be improved.
One of the central points is of course life-long on-going and vocational training.
Continuing training schemes are becoming increasingly important, and we should therefore also concentrate on the best ways of passing on knowledge.
By e-learning - to use the general term - but much more, I believe, by e-entertainment.
Learning should be fun, learning should be interesting, learning should make you curious, but learning should also be an adventure.
We ought in future to provide an experience primarily with a European content, putting our European values, our European knowledge at centre stage on the Internet and in our education and learning programmes as well as being ready to engage in international competition.
We also need new systems in schools, however.
We need new methods of quality management for teachers and pupils.
ISO 9000 is already taken for granted in firms.
It seems to me that these new procedural techniques could also be used to make appreciable progress in schools.
But enterprises also need easier access to funding.
We need people to start new businesses and the mentality to start new businesses, and we need to make it easier for businesses to pass from one generation to the next.
Tax concessions need to be offered and venture capital made available, because the life cycle of a business goes: founded, handed over and finally closed.
We need to give thought to all three phases in future.
Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr RÃŒbig for approaching his report with such an open mind and, of course, to agree that innovation concerns entrepreneurship and employment.
However, we need it not just to serve the economy, the knowledge-driven economy in today's society, we also need it to serve the knowledge-driven and cultural society.
Because innovation is not just an economic and business factor, it is also an educational and cultural factor.
More to the point, it is the result of mutual and complex actions and reactions between education, research, the administration and the public.
Innovative procedures presuppose a dynamic social model which is receptive to change.
In fact, innovation does not depend solely or exclusively on technological factors, it also depends on organisational factors.
A propitious environment is the main requirement, so that new initiatives, new discoveries and scientific applications can be developed, which is why we need social components working together, we need close cooperation between businesses and scientific institutions, as well as schools and universities, and we also need the help of the media if an innovative culture is to mature in our society as a whole.
Innovation must be the property of every member of society. That is how our society will work in new directions, opening up new paths.
Europe needs an approach to innovation which will directly serve society as a whole.
However, we know that there are quite a few negative structural factors which prevent us from progressing as far as we should.
We are quite a way behind and I think that this is a bitter but honest admission, which is why we need the measures proposed in the report, together with suitable educational systems that nurture innovation.
Innovation is a process of analysis and synthesis and young people - mainly students - need therefore to play a part.
We must take care to ensure that we do not just inflict talk and chalk on young people and that they take an active part in the innovative process during their studies and both inside and outside school.
We must cultivate this approach at all levels of education.
It is important to have cross-disciplinary syllabuses in tertiary education.
We must bring the exact and the theoretical sciences close together, however difficult that may seem.
We must also understand that we need better penetration of university research institutes and of scientific libraries via the Internet.
I should like to highlight this sector in particular, because we are still a long way from having the really efficient network of libraries in Europe that is an absolute must.
Finally, we should take steps to provide better protection for intellectual property because this is what can invigorate and foster the incentive for our scientists to innovate.
That is why it is also extremely important for us to promote the application of European patent law.
Madam President, at last spring' s Lisbon Summit the Heads of State and Government set themselves an ambitious target. The European Union was to become the most dynamic and the most competitive economic area in the world.
Innovation is the key to this.
It is the subject of an excellent report by Mr RÃŒbig, whom I would expressly like to congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. His report is thorough and precise; it is creative and full of insights.
Only an innovation offensive will create the necessary conditions for making up the ground we have lost to the USA and Japan, preventing a mass exodus of researchers and finally achieving international competitiveness.
Specifically, it means changing our systems of education.
Young people must be able to be involved at an early stage, by teaching them science in schools and specifically encouraging their talents.
Curricula must include projects modelled on professional management, by forming junior enterprises, for example.
We need new information systems and higher technological qualifications in the training and further training of workers and students.
Mr RÃŒbig has always been concerned with revitalising small and medium-sized enterprises.
His particular concern is important given that we have 18 million SMEs.
Workers are specifically asking for programmes to promote SMEs in the European Union because over 70 to 80 % work in that sector.
SMEs need simpler tax procedures, a dismantling of bureaucratic hurdles, and active support for innovative products and methods of production.
Research needs to be integrated into operating structures.
Access to start-up capital is essential, because young people need to be able to start new businesses, to become entrepreneurs.
They need to be able to take all the current problems of the new economy into account.
I hope we have all learned something from that.
On this basis, Madam President, the European Union will be able to make a sustained contribution to the high performance, knowledge-driven economy we are looking to achieve.
In Lisbon and Stockholm, it was decided that Europe should become the world' s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-driven economy.
Of the seventeen million companies in Europe, no fewer than 99 percent form part of the medium-sized and small business sector.
That accounts for more than 70 percent of employment, 50 percent of investment and 60 percent of the Union' s wealth.
As such, the medium-sized and small businesses are the most important economic factor in the European economy.
The competitiveness of these businesses very much relies on their innovative capacity.
At the moment, Parliament is working hard on the Sixth Framework Programme, in which the participation of SMEs must be guaranteed at the same - or, ideally, a higher - level.
I have therefore proposed to increase the budget available to SMEs to 15 percent from the current 10 percent.
But that participation of SMEs must, in the view of the Liberal Group, take place within themed programmes.
Indeed, in that way, it is guaranteed that large and small companies will join forces, for small companies do not have the expertise and manpower to go it alone. It is not acceptable for most of the limited research budget that is available to be spent on the flanking policy in the Member States, for that is not a European task.

It is more important to simplify the participation of medium-sized and small businesses in the Sixth Framework Programme.
That is why the 'rules of participation' must be simplified and standardised so that research applications submitted by all Directorates-General for the Sixth Framework Programme as a whole can be dealt with more efficiently and more quickly.
I should like to conclude by giving you some food for thought: Europe is good at converting euros into research, but often fails in converting research into euros, and that must change in future.

Madam President, the Commission and the rapporteur are preparing for a more innovative Europe.
This report calls for the networks to be strengthened at European level.
This dissemination of gathered knowledge should not lead to less competition, which is another aspect of innovation, for what are the areas in which cooperation actually reinforces the ability to innovate?
Tax benefits are in any case not a very good incentive.
They fragment the market and can lead to a shift in activities to the cheapest region.
Market-oriented attraction is preferable.
The rapporteur also underlines the importance of education.
This is an area in which only the Member States have authority.
In this connection, it is not the international orientation or the mobility of education and research itself, but the results, that deserve recognition.
National initiatives promoting the innovative environment and acknowledging achievements will have to increase competitiveness.
The aspects that make European regions into an attractive environment in terms of innovation are the knowledge available, the labour market and other local factors.
A government should therefore have a vision of regional profiles it would like in future.
However, regional specialisms can be adversely affected either by tax measures or by uniform measures which are said to result in a loss of quality for Europe as a whole.
The Commission proposal is typified - more so than the report - by a realistic approach from the bottom upwards.
If necessary, a joint approach could play an additional role to promote networks.
In that way, the Union can back the measures which increase the Member States' ability to innovate, both individually and jointly.
Madam President, Commissioner, my colleagues, knowledge and know-how are the basis of economic competitiveness and of the well-being of society as a whole.
The ambitious objectives of Lisbon also threaten to remain so much rhetoric, and will perish like worldly honour, if the success of the European Union in global competition is not based on a high level of education and research.
There are several aspects relating to a comprehensive innovation policy, which many colleagues have already emphasised in their interventions.
As European legislators, we should pay particular attention to simplifying legislation and administration.
I subscribe to the view of Mr RÃŒbig and of other colleagues, that simplification is a necessity.
Enterprise and development activity is excessively restricted by bureaucratic impediments, and small and medium-sized enterprises in particular suffer from this.
Besides some form of labour reform, we also need a complete administrative reform, which has already got off to a good start with the White Paper on administrative models.
As you, yourself, said a couple of days ago, our esteemed competitors the United States and Japan are further along the road of promoting and developing innovations than the EU; one of the reasons for this is that in those countries enterprise and risk-taking are rewarded to a significantly greater degree than in Europe.
We must create conditions which encourage self-starting and independent initiative.
Enterprise can be promoted early among schoolchildren and students.
All we need to do is to create the prerequisite conditions in our education systems, for example, in the form of a special business model which young businesses can then adopt.
I also regard the development of human capital as important.
It is a significant factor in innovation.
A genuine information society must be within the reach of all citizens, and so raising the level of know-how of the entire population is important.
The copyright of innovations must also be better protected; this has already been mentioned in other interventions.
Even before this, in the course of my work I have stressed the importance of adopting a Community Patent which will cover the entire area of the European Union.
The Community Patent would offer complete Union-wide protection for new patents, at the same time significantly reducing the administrative costs of firms.
And last but not least: we need a revolution in thinking which would free us from orthodox thinking and modes of action.
We must create conditions which make it possible to produce a whole raft of new ideas, out of which we may perhaps develop that one breakthrough innovation.
New technology is not the key to a good future; we need non-conventional thinking in all fields, in firms as well as in public administration.
Madam President, Commissioner, with outstanding diligence and sometimes frightening consistency of purpose my fellow countryman Paul RÃŒbig has again produced a report containing almost everything that is good and right.
For that very reason, I hope I may be allowed to question some of it.
We have been discussing why innovation is so important for the European Union.
The rapporteur has given a broad answer to that question.
We could of course ask him what innovation?
What innovation is most in demand at the moment?
Perhaps military technology so we can find Osama bin Laden quickly.
Is that the kind of innovation we mean?
Is it innovation in surveillance that will enable us to uncover sleepers in the future?
Or do we not need to define innovation?
With our European system of values, are we not concerned here with innovation in education, innovation in social learning?
And how will we get there?
Would it not be an innovation finally to know how much is spent on innovation?
Do you know, Commissioner?
I have tried to find out how much is invested in the future in a big country like the Federal Republic of Germany.
We know what is spent on administration, we know what is invested in transfer payments, but when it comes to investing in the future, nobody knows.
We all agree that there cannot be too much funding for investment, because that is really the only way to safeguard the future.
But the question is, what kind of a future?
Where are we heading?
And is not the time after 11 September actually an ideal time to question much that was simply only a fixation with technology and instead to initiate research into social innovation?
Has the time not now also come to free ourselves from old instruments like gross national product and bring the innovative instrument of a well being factor more into the centre?
Questions on a good report.
Nevertheless, once again congratulations, Paul!
Madam President, the role played by innovation in achieving the ambitious objectives set by the European Union in Lisbon has been mentioned by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate on his detailed report, and by previous speakers.
However, the importance of innovation to our economic and social development needs to be appreciated more both by the Member States and by the European Commission itself.
Delays in implementing innovative measures under the Structural Funds and the cancellation of resources are sad proof of the fact that innovation often gets no further than the drawing board.
So we need a decisive and coordinated policy which ensures that innovation penetrates our entire economic and social fabric and that our citizens' creative powers are give free rein.
That is why I should like to highlight the fact that this policy needs to be driven by the principle of equal opportunities.
For a start, I do not believe that innovation is the duty or preserve of the young, I believe it should affect all ages with lifelong learning and the other methods mentioned by previous speakers.
I would like to point out that we need to encourage women in their individual and collective efforts, such as setting up companies, and we need to encourage women's non-governmental organisations to take an innovative approach to social activities which have a positive impact on social cohesion and job creation.
Equal opportunities should also apply geographically, given the huge discrepancies between the regions of the European Union when it comes to innovation.
Both the European Union and the Member States should pay special attention to disadvantaged regions, which are usually the mountain and island areas of the Union.
With the lack of innovation in Europe compared with the United States and Japan, we need to get moving and mobilise our forces.
This means that the spirit of innovation must also drive the European Union's innovation management policy.
Special units, such as the unit set up to manage innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, are a step in the right direction, they just need to be adequately staffed to make them effective.
The European Commission must also focus on disseminating the results of best practices, which is why pioneering methods need to be found, with much better penetration and efficiency than those available under past policies and both the Member States of the European Union and candidate countries must work with the European Union and take appropriate steps to disseminate best practices and adopt all the new models which account for the performance of the best countries.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr RÃŒbig, for an excellent report and the House for a debate displaying quality and commitment.
It is widely recognised that policies that foster innovation are an underlying determinant of economic growth.
I am particularly happy to present to you today the very latest findings of the EU' s innovation policy performance, namely the 2001 Innovation Scoreboard, which was compiled as a follow-up to the report last year.
The 2001 European Innovation Scoreboard gives us a starting point for the Union' s strategy to enhance its overall competitiveness, by providing a common measure of a country's performance using 17 indicators.
I would also like to say that I share the rapporteur' s opinion in underlining the importance of education and training, something that has been noted by other speakers.
One indicator called for in the report was added to the scoreboard to cover lifelong learning.
EU performance in terms of growth and the standard of living relative to the US and Japan highlights the key challenges that the EU faces in enhancing its competitiveness.
In the past twenty-five years, and apart from temporary cyclical fluctuations, the EU has not kept pace with the US in improving its standard of living.
The gap is now wider than it was a quarter of a century ago.
At the aggregate level, the gap in living standards can be attributed to two factors: two-thirds to the employment rate, which is lower, and one-third to productivity.
I will focus on the productivity gap.
Until the mid-1990s, the productivity gap between the EU and the US narrowed steadily.
In the second half of the 1990s, however, the rapid acceleration of productivity growth in the US again began to widen the gap.
Until the early 1990s, capital-intensive industries spearheaded productivity growth.
This changed in the mid-1990s, when research and innovation became the key determinants.
The industries that achieved the greatest productivity gains during the late 1990s were predominantly research-intensive.
The overall strategy for boosting competitiveness requires us to better combine Union and Member State efforts to develop more effective policies to foster and support innovation.
National innovation policies should be reinforced, developed, and take a more consistent approach across the EU.
This is why we need a regular benchmarking exercise to measure and compare the performance of EU countries, identify key areas of weakness and strength, and enable ourselves to design and fine-tune innovation policies accordingly.
Taking the EU as a whole, we still lag behind the US and Japan on most indicators.
We trail significantly in terms of private-sector investment in research and development.
Rapid increases in business research and development in Japan and the US since 1994 have widened the gap with Europe alarmingly.
US expenditure in this area is now 74% higher than in Europe.
Europe' s high-tech patenting activity is also too weak: US businesses apply for more high-technology patents in Europe than do European businesses.
Japanese patenting in Europe is almost as strong as US patenting.
This patenting imbalance is an area that requires urgent attention.
At individual Member State level, the picture is different.
I must say that, as regards many indicators, the best-performing EU countries are also world leaders, sometimes doing substantially better than the US and Japan.
I will give you some examples: the UK, Ireland and France, for example, are world-leading suppliers of science and engineering graduates; the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark are ahead in home Internet access; Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden lead in public research and development; and Sweden is well ahead in business research and development expenditure.
However, differences in innovation performance between Member States are still significant.
Countries such as Denmark and Finland, whose performance was already strong, continue to lead the field when measured by the innovation index, that is to say in terms of trends, not scoreboards alone.
Greece and Spain are rapidly catching up with the EU average, while starting from a relatively low base.
But change is important and positive.
The four largest EU economies (France, Germany, the UK and Italy) are improving, but at rates below the EU average.
A number of lessons can be drawn from these results.
The Union should: first, invest in education and training, as has been said here a few times; second, improve its performance in the high-tech sectors and promote entrepreneurship; third, help to step up business research and development by encouraging Member States to introduce or increase the necessary incentives; and finally, promote the use of technologies in all sectors of the economy, including public administrations.
I am pleased to see that several of these aspects are well covered by Mr RÃŒbig' s report.
I believe this report will help to generate a consensus on the way forward.
This is necessary, as shown by the findings of the Innovation Scoreboard.
The report expresses Europe' s wish to reduce the Union' s innovation deficit and achieve the goal set at Lisbon and, hence, does a great deal to help improve the EU' s overall competitiveness.
I hope that there will be an opportunity to come back to these issues in the Commission' s 2001 Competitiveness Report, which will be presented in a few weeks' time.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Exhaustion of trade mark rights
The next item is the report (A5-0311/2001) by Mr Mayer, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the problem of the exhaustion of trade mark rights (SEC(1999)2033 - C5-0354/2000 - 2000/2187(COS)).
Madam President, I would like briefly to outline the underlying issues and the main points of my report.
The central statement is that the Commission is called upon to produce a detailed study of the possible implications of the transition to the principle of international exhaustion by 31 December 2002.
The Nera study presented by the Commission in 1999 fails to deal with this matter adequately.
A trade mark right has its effects only in the territory for which it was granted.
Community exhaustion applies to the Community mark and national marks when the holder of the right has put his product into circulation in the Community for the first time.
If the holder of the trade mark right puts his product into circulation outside the Community, the legal effects of the marks are not exhausted in the Community.
He can therefore prevent parallel importers from importing the product into the Community.
Because of the current Community-wide exhaustion regime he can therefore quote two different prices: a lower one for countries outside the Community and a higher one for the Community itself.
This split pricing policy, however, is not what the trade mark right is about.
The main purpose of the mark is to make the product distinguishable and familiar and to indicate a certain product quality.
We could also speak about the advertising effect.
The division of markets to the disadvantage of consumers in the Community cannot be the objective of granting a Community trade mark.
Neither is there anything in competition law to argue against parallel imports.
So why should it be possible to use trade mark rights to prevent them?
There is something wrong there.
We must do something to get back to more competition and lower prices for branded goods.
The same conclusion was reached in a study by the Swedish competition authority, as, too, did a discussion paper by the Irish competition authority.
A hearing before a Select Committee of the British House of Commons was also presented predominantly with arguments in favour of international exhaustion.
There is now an important new factor: the increasing amount of trade on the Internet.
The present exhaustion regime could hamper the development of e-commerce.
It is not in fact certain whether Internet sales with the subsequent dispatch of branded goods are permissible under trade mark law.
But legal certainty and consumer protection are essential conditions for the development of trade over the Internet.
Then there are the following points. There are a) trade marks that are not really matched to any particular product.
For example, you order 'a Siemens' .
'A Siemens' can be a lamp, a washing machine or a nuclear power station. There are b) also trade marks that designate group products, for example Adidas shoes, whether they are sandals or high heels.
There are c) trade marks that require absolute identity, in medicine for example. It cannot be even one milligram different from what the mark designates.
All these points are reason enough to call on the Commission to undertake its own comprehensive study.
Such a study must also draw comparisons with the world' s major trading nations and study and make a precise analysis of the implications for the EU labour market.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Mayer who, in spite of some extremely polarised positions, listened and put forward an alternative in the form of a proposal for further consideration, which met with everyone' s approval.
This position is all the more important and necessary since the report refers to the crucial problems related to globalisation and European integration.
In addition to the direct interests of consumers and manufacturers, the economic position of the European Union in world trade is at stake.
Some may be in favour of a total liberalisation of trade, whereas others, myself included, believe that the system of Community exhaustion responds to the need to develop the integration of the single market, a favourable way of supporting Europe in the face of global competition.
Apart from the concept of integration, the crux of this report is to support innovation, and God knows how much we have spoken about this in the previous report, to support innovation and creativity within the Community.
Trade marks are the most important and most efficient way of protecting intellectual property.
Trade marks provide the consumer with a guarantee of a product' s authenticity and quality, and they ensure pre-sales, shape investment and, consequently, creation.
A change in the system could lead to a drop in investment in research and development of European products and the impact on jobs could be significant.
The current system also provides the best means of protection against counterfeiting, as the channels used by parallel importers are often those used to transport pirate products.
In the studies that are currently available, and I stress the 'currently' , we found no relevant information enabling us to justify a change to the system, which could be detrimental to innovation.
I hope that the further consideration proposed by Mr Mayer will confirm this opinion.
Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Mayer on the report he is presenting today.
I am perfectly aware that it is not the report he would have liked to approve and, although it is little consolation, I would like to say that I also would have preferred the report finally approved by Parliament to have been the one Mr Mayer initially drew up.
Despite the powerful interests concerned with preventing the world trade in trade mark products, the unusual report by a consulting company which states that consumers would not benefit immediately from the acquisition of goods at lower prices and the lukewarm position of the Commission which does not seem interested in seeking a solution to a problem which has a very negative effect on European consumers, the rapporteur, Mr Mayer, has been able to produce a report urging persistence in the quest for formulae which prevent manufacturers of trade mark products from maintaining excessively high prices on European markets.
When, in July 1998, the Court of Justice issued the Silhouette judgment, it caused great commotion in countries which recognised the principle of international exhaustion of the trade mark. Either by law, as in Sweden for example, or by jurisprudence, as in my country, Spain.
Legally, the judgment is unassailable from the moment that it states that Article 7 of the Trade Mark Directive, by establishing the principle of Community exhaustion, indirectly establishes the prohibition of international exhaustion.
But this is a legalistic interpretation which does not prevent the recognition, as the judgment does, of the harmful effects for consumers of the fact that owners of trade marks can prevent the import of their own products if they originate from third countries.
The arguments used by those people who defend the prohibition of the international exhaustion of trade marks - combating counterfeiting, maintaining the prestigious image of goods, diversion of income from the manufacturer to the importer - are at odds with a reality which is demonstrated in the documents produced by the rapporteur.
When parallel imports from third countries are allowed, the prices of trade mark products drop.
The information provided on price increases in Germany, when the reform of German law prevented international exhaustion, is conclusive.
And although my experience is of little scientific value, I must point out that I have been able to note how, in the United States, a product which in Spain costs me EUR 10, costs me just EUR 1.5.
For all these reasons and despite the reservations involved in finding a consensus in favour of a more ambitious resolution, it is important that the Commission takes the initiative in favour of consumers and brings forward proposals to strengthen the world market, removing barriers to trade, which are not just customs barriers, but which often consist of anti-competitive practices by companies whose aim is to defend their own profits.
Madam President, Commissioner, I must say that I have not, unfortunately, read either the book No Logo or the special edition of The Economist entitled Pro Logo in The Economist.
Clearly, however, we have embarked upon a very interesting discussion of trade marks and their significance in terms of dividing up world markets.
Those of us who want to see a form of globalisation that is of benefit to all parties look forward to an international exhaustion of trade mark rights in accordance with the original Mayer report.
The same applies if one is in favour of an effective competition policy, as mentioned by the rapporteur, for European exhaustion as it is at present enables markets to be divided up, providing benefits to manufacturers but not to consumers.
Different studies can produce different results.
The Commission takes a relatively negative view of international exhaustion in its study. On the other hand, we also have the experience referred to by the previous speaker whereby there are quite a few countries in which goods became more expensive after Community exhaustion had been introduced, for example Germany, Sweden and Great Britain.
I am also sorry that this matter could not have been taken further during the Swedish Presidency which, I know, accorded it a high priority.
I therefore hope that we shall now, in fact, produce a report on this subject. I also hope that the Commissioner can tell us what opportunities there are for addressing the issue in the context of the WTO in which a new round of talks is about to start.
I also think it is important not to confuse this issue with that of pirate manufacturing, which is a completely different matter.
There are new ways of checking the authenticity of goods by means of genuine and detailed identification, facilitating a completely new form of supervision.
I therefore hope that the Commission is able to support the endeavours representing the main approach taken by Parliament today, as well as by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
Madam President, at this hour brevity is a duty and not a virtue.
Although I was not a member of the committee which produced this report, I want to speak because my colleague, Mrs McCarthy, who was a member, is detained by the grave events now under discussion at our party conference in Brighton.
I am speaking as someone concerned with consumer affairs.
Like Mrs Thors, I was for a time the Chair of the Consumer Protection Intergroup.
Parliament's Rules do not allow us to express these opinions in the way we once did.
The substantial majority which Mr Mayer rallied in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was, of course, for a response which, as my colleague has said, was less than he would have wished.
It is also less than I would have wished and it should be less than this Parliament would have wished.
The principal recommendation here is for a further study of the consequences of a transition to the use of the principle of international exhaustion.
Fine, but how long is that going to take when a parallel importer can be prevented from giving the consumer a quality product at a price which benefits them both?
This is not like counterfeit products, as another speaker tried to suggest.
It is not competitive selling at a loss to weaken rival products, nor is it driving down the quality of those products.
It is a straightforward blockage of trade, which will not diminish the so-called grey markets but will make them more confused and complex.
We need this to be a study which tells us of the shady side of what proclaims itself to be a respectable trade.
I do not really expect more from the Commissioner tonight than I have heard from him privately.
However, the matter cannot rest here.
The Silhouette case was not the last word on all this and nor, as he would acknowledge, is Mr Mayer's report.
Nevertheless I salute him.
Madam President, this is an important subject and has been discussed at various places and at various times.
It is important that the exhaustion regime for Trade marks which the Community applies provides for a proper balance between the interest of consumer prices and protection of Trade mark rights.
It has been stated by those who advocate a change to the Community-wide exhaustion regime, that a unilateral change to international exhaustion of Trade mark rights would have a significant impact on consumer prices.
The Commission is not convinced that this would be the case.
According to the Nera study carried out by a consultancy firm based in London which was submitted to the Commission in February 1999, prices under international exhaustion would probably not be very different from those that are currently in force.
Mr Berenguer Fuster and the rapporteur have referred to alleged price increases in Germany of films, perfume and cameras.
As soon as this became known, the sectors concerned supplied statistics to the Commission to show that prices have not increased as was claimed, but have remained the same or in some cases even decreased.
The purported evidence concerning Germany is not what it seems to be and, in fact, supports the case that the Commission has put forward and not the case in favour of international exhaustion.
There has also been a price study carried out by the Swedish and the UK governments.
It is very interesting to note, and significant for this debate, that of the items where comparisons between the European Union and the United States were possible, the cheapest market was often within the European Union.
For some products, the United States was even the most expensive market.
Moreover, there were considerable price differences between Member States.
In general, prices in Germany and France were lower than in the UK and in Sweden.
Those differences exist within the European Union where there is regional exhaustion for Trade mark rights and not international exhaustion.
In other words, for all Member States of the European Union the same exhaustion regime applies yet there is a 40% price difference in electronic goods between Sweden and Germany.
This certainly goes to show that the internal market is not performing as it should be, but it also shows that the differences in prices have nothing to do with whether the exhaustion regime is regional or international.
The price differences within the European Union usually exceed the price differences between EU Member States and the United States.
In other words, the arguments in favour of the thesis that international exhaustion would lead to a decrease in prices is very tenuous.
In fact the Commission does not believe that evidence at all.
Furthermore, I should like to add that the price element is only one aspect of the exhaustion issue.
It is also very important to consider the legitimate interest of Trade mark holders in their home markets.
For many companies the Trade mark is their most valuable asset and that is not something we should take lightly.
Trade marks are also of value to consumers because they represent a sign of quality.
The Commission decided in May 2000 that there is no reason, at least for the time being, to propose any change to the current regime.
The Commission considers that there is now a proper balance between the interests at stake and that the current Community-wide exhaustion regime is an appropriate way to protect the legitimate rights of Trade mark holders.
The Commission has taken due note, obviously, of Mr Mayer's report and of the long and difficult discussions in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Many arguments have been put forward for and against a change of regime.
The Commission recognised all those arguments from previous discussions in other fora.
All the aspects mentioned have been thoroughly studied and analysed by the Commission services and in my view no new elements have been put forward which would require further examination or which would give the Commission reason to reconsider its decision.
Having said this, the Commission intends to monitor the question of exhaustion closely and will certainly take any action necessary should new and important reasons emerge to consider abandoning the current exhaustion regime.
In the meantime, the Commission is, of course, willing to share with Parliament our experiences concerning cases of possible abuse of Trade mark rights but in order to make the report more useful and balanced the Commission intends to take all relevant elements into consideration.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon on Wednesday.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have here before me a newspaper interview, from which I should like to read you an extract.
It reads 'I do not agree with the Anti-Slavery Conference in Durban.
It promotes a sense of victimisation in people who already feel like victims.'
It goes on to say: 'I am not happy with the whole Conference in Durban, quite apart from the way in which the Middle East was discussed and the fact that someone like Castro was applauded. These are indicators that this was an anti-western meeting' .
These are not my words, but those of a European Commissioner, namely Mr Bolkestein.
Last night in my group, our group chairman told me that Mr Nielson, on account of unfortunate statements he made concerning anti-American imperialism, will have to justify himself before the Conference of Presidents.
Would it not be fair, therefore, if you, in your capacity as President of the Conference of Presidents, were also to invite Mr Bolkestein, giving him the opportunity to explain before the Conference of Presidents these very unfortunate, extremely dangerous statements at a time when we, as the Western world, must join forces with the Islamic world to combat terrorism.
Mr Staes, I can confirm that Mr Nielson will be attending the Conference of Presidents and we shall consider your suggestion.
Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the Finnish language programmes have been removed from Parliament' s television network.
We wondered why that was, but got no explanation for it.
There are therefore no programmes being broadcast from Finland, while some Member States can get three or even four channels.
Could I request the President to ask those concerned to correct the situation, as it is odd, particularly during these times of crisis, that one Member State' s programme signal should have been removed from the television network without any explanation.
Mr Paasilinna, due to absolutely exceptional circumstances, Mrs Banotti has unfortunately not yet arrived.
We shall, of course, inform her of your dissatisfaction and she will immediately find out what can be done.
Announcement by the President
The Court of First Instance has recently rejected the appeals lodged by Members of the European Parliament, the National Front and the Bonino List against Parliament' s decision of 14 September 1999 not to recognise the existence of the Technical Group of Independent Members.
In accordance with the provision of the order, the cases concerned were joined for the purposes of judgment and the appeals were rejected.
In each case, the applicants will bear their own costs and the costs of Parliament, including those incurred in the summary proceedings in case 222/99.
The judgment was delivered in open session in Luxembourg on 2 October 2001.
As a result, the suspensive order handed down by the President of the Court of First Instance on 25 November 1999 at the end of the summary proceedings lapsed when the judgment was delivered, in other words, on 2 October 2001, pursuant to Article 107(3) of the Court' s Rule of Procedure.
Therefore, Parliament' s decision of 14 September 1999 not to recognise the existence of the Technical Group of Independent Members is once again fully effective.
I shall of course give the floor to Mr Dell' Alba.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the eighteen MEPs belonging to the Technical Group of Independent Members have taken note of the judgment of the Court of First Instance on 2 October.
They point out that this judgment is somehow the inverse image of the order handed down by the President of the same court, who, on 25 November 1999, ruled that Parliament was obliged to recognise the legitimate existence of our group.
It stands to reason that we shall be appealing against yesterday' s decision and that, obviously, we ask for an interim order to suspend the effects of the judgment.
In this respect, Madam President, in order to avoid any misunderstandings, I ask you, before making further provisions to consult the Legal Services as to the effects of the suspension, which is what we shall ask the Court to do, as is within our rights.
Having said that, I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to two important aspects of yesterday' s judgment.
The first aspect is that our appeal is fully admissible and, therefore, MEPs are fully entitled to question the justice of actions of the European Parliament, such as these.
This was not what Parliament wished, as it had requested that the Court declare that this appeal should not be admitted.
The second aspect is that, on several occasions, the Court recognises that disparities do exist in the treatment of the Members of the European Parliament.
The Court mentions this in Paragraphs 201 and 57 of yesterday' s judgment.
I am not going to quote these paragraphs and I will simply say that the Court declared that Parliament must remedy these disparities, as part of its duties to manage internal affairs.
Mr Corbett, since your draft report on the reform of Articles 29 and 30, which aims to rectify these disparities has been held in abeyance for a year, we shall continue our fight, we shall be vigilant and we shall do everything within our power to ensure that we continue this fight to eliminate these disparities and that it does not cease as a result of yesterday' s judgment.
Madam President, I am delighted at the victory of Parliament at the Court of First Instance.
It confirms that we were right in the decision that we took.
Mr Dell'Alba, though, is also right to draw attention to the fact that we must ensure that there are no disparities or discriminations in our Rules.
That was the objective of the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which we held in abeyance pending the judgment of the Court.
Perhaps now is the time for this report to come before the full House, but if there is to be an appeal and if - although I would personally doubt this - the full Court of Justice were to suspend the effects of the decision of the Court of First Instance until they themselves rule, that would put us in a difficult position with the report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Personally I doubt that the full Court of Justice would give such an ordinance giving a suspensive effect, in which case we can proceed immediately to look at the disparity that some people may feel exists in our Rules.
My report would, I am sure, go some way to reassuring people.
Mr Corbett, what I can say to you and Mr Dell' Alba is that, of course, if there is to be an appeal, I shall examine very closely, in conjunction with Parliament' s Legal Service, whether this appeal will have a suspensive effect.
We shall look into this matter extremely carefully.
Madam President, the judgment is very clear, but in a society governed by the rule of law there must, of course, be the right of appeal and the judgment must have no effects until such time as the highest court has reached its conclusion.
The judgment is also very clear when it comes to the duties of Parliament.
Among the grounds of the judgment, number 157 expressly states that it is Parliament' s duty, within the framework of its relevant internal procedures, to investigate whether the disparities in treatment of the two categories of Members arising from the aforesaid internal procedures are all necessary and, therefore, objectively justified.
This is, to speak plainly, a broad hint to us to examine our Rules of Procedure to see whether they are discriminatory.
I think that all MEPs and political units such as the Italian Radical Party must have completely equal opportunities. They must naturally have the same political rights as the political groups, apart from a number of rights quite specific to the latter.
However, the rules need to be examined critically to ensure that political units have the same opportunities to work in Parliament. I would therefore call upon you to request the legal services to go through the judgment carefully and see how we are to improve the Rules of Procedure in order to ensure complete equality.
I would also call for the judgment to be brought up at the first meeting of the Conference of Presidents to be held directly after such an investigation of the judgment has been carried out. In that context, we shall be able to debate a package of arrangements for independent MEPs and smaller political units which are not large enough to form a group and, in that way, be able to secure the fair treatment of MEPs.
Madam President, I must take this opportunity to inform you that a party of schoolchildren invited by me for this week - tomorrow to be precise - has cancelled the visit.
I also heard, however, that mine was not the only group affected, but that around half the invited groups had cancelled their visits this week.
The children in question, or their parents, fear that security measures in this House are inadequate and that the children would be in danger if they visited Parliament.
Let me request you, then, to supply the public with extensive information about the adequacy of the security arrangements.
Should this not be possible, consideration should be given to a general suspension of visits.
I myself have also another concern: I would welcome it if those visitors' quotas that cannot be made use of because visits have been cancelled, could be set aside for future dates rather than be lost, so that these groups that, for understandable reasons, are not visiting Parliament now, may make up for it at a later date.
The Bureau members will be meeting this evening and I shall inform them of your proposal.
Madam President, as regards the formation of Parliamentary Groups, our group expressed itself quite unambiguously at the time this Parliament was constituted.
We are grateful for this confirmation of our understanding of the law.
Further to certain remarks by Members, I would again like to make it clear that our Rules of Procedure, decided on by this Parliament, make a clear distinction between Members belonging to a group and pooling their rights in it, and those who do not belong to a group.
Members without a group should quite clearly not be discriminated against, but that does not mean that they, as individual Members, enjoy complete equality of treatment with the groups.
Rule 30 of our Rules of Procedure expressly states that Members not belonging to a group have the use of a Secretariat with all other details being decided on by the Presidents.
That is now the legal position as handed down by the Court of First Instance, and we should proceed in accordance with it in the coming months.
Extraordinary European Council of 21 September 2001 in Brussels - Preparatory work for the European Council in Ghent
The next item is the Council and Commission statements, firstly, on the Extraordinary European Council held in Brussels on 21 September 2001, and secondly, on the preparatory work for the European Council in Ghent.
I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, and I shall now give him the floor.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was keen to inform you as quickly as possible about the progress of the work done at the extraordinary European Council held on 21 September involving the Heads of State and Government of the European Union.
I felt that it was important to involve you, as MEPs, closely in the European Union' s talks and decisions, as we have done since the tragic events occurred.
As you know, the European Council met to analyse the international situation following the terrorist attacks in the United States and to give the necessary impetus to the actions taken by the European Union.
The talks rapidly led to unanimous conclusions, the text of which was made public on the evening of 21 September.
I do not intend to read it out here in its entirety, but I would like to emphasise the salient points.
I will first inform you that the presidency is most satisfied to see the European Union decide that the fight against terrorism is a priority, and to reaffirm its unyielding determination to take concerted action under any and all circumstances.
The terrorist threat is a test for European integration.
The unanimity displayed by the European Council, the quality of its debate, and the adoption of comprehensive and specific measures all show that the Union proved to be equal to the challenge.
The extraordinary Council gave the Union an opportunity to get several important messages across.
The first message is one of solidarity and cooperation with the United States.
The European Union shares the same values as the United States: those of an open, democratic, multi-cultural society.
The Union will stand alongside the United States to bring to justice the perpetrators of these barbarous acts, together with their sponsors and accomplices, and to ensure that they are punished.
We are of the opinion that the targeted American reprisals are legitimate under Security Council Resolution 1368.
We are prepared to commit ourselves to this line, each Member State according to its means.
However, we must not underestimate the seriousness of this scourge.
If we are to succeed, we must have the backing of a broad coalition, under the aegis of the United Nations.
This coalition would include candidates for EU membership, the Russian Federation and our Arab partners.
The second message that the European Union would like to get across following this Council is that it is fully committed to fighting terrorism, and to this end has adopted an action plan comprising five series of measures.
The first series of measures consists of bolstering essential police and judicial cooperation.
To this end, the European Council has set a number of objectives, including the creation of a European arrest warrant and the establishment of a common definition of terrorism.
The same European Council has also taken a firm decision to adopt measures for identifying terrorists and the organisations that support them in order to draw up lists of terrorist organisations.
In this connection, the role of Europol and its cooperation with the United States will be reinforced.
The second series of measures in the action plan, which I consider to be very important, involves the development of international legal instruments.
There are many such instruments that need to be implemented and it would no doubt be worthwhile examining, as India suggests, the idea of a general convention against international terrorism.
The third series of measures on which the European Union would like to work involves the funding of terrorism.
Here too, specific action will be taken at EU level, particularly with regard to money laundering and the freezing of assets.
The fourth series of measures involves air safety.
The European Union intends to swiftly devise a set of specific, technical measures for this purpose, such as baggage checks, technical training for crews and so on.
Lastly, I wish to draw your attention to the fifth series of measures, which involves the common, foreign and security policy as a whole.
The emphasis has been placed on the need to coordinate the Union' s overall action; the idea being to bolster the common, foreign and security policy, in order for there to be an integrated campaign against terrorism, including the systematic reassessment of relations between the European Union and third countries in the light of any support that these countries might give to terrorism.
In the medium and long term, the fight against terrorism will also require the Union to strengthen its prevention policy and to become more involved in stabilising regional conflicts.
As part of this, the European Union certainly intends to enhance its role, with the assistance of the United States, Russia and its partners in Arab countries, in order to work towards finding a long-term solution to the Middle East conflict.
In addition, the development of the common, foreign and security policy (CFSP) and the European security and defence policy (ESDP) could have long-lasting effects.
These EU policies must not be used as tools for reprisals, but as a means of prevention.
Conflict prevention also implies an unstinting commitment on the part of the European Union to integrate all countries into a global system of security and sustainable prosperity.
Finally, we must pay special attention to the problem of refugees.
On this issue, the Commission will devise projects to assist Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries.
The last message sent by the European Council was to reassure the European countries and the markets about the economy, and it will be helped in this endeavour by the conclusions of the informal ECOFIN Council held at the same time in LiÃšge, and to stress the positive role the euro will play in this economic context that we are experiencing.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is the content of the message of the European Council held on 21 September.
To sum up, I would like to add two comments.
First of all, as is so often the case, the crisis situation created by the attacks in New York and Washington has given impetus to European unification.
The Extraordinary European Council on 21 September provided an opportunity to take practical decisions and to display genuine European leadership.
The Belgian Presidency will endeavour to follow up its commitments, particularly at the forthcoming General Affairs Council in October and the Ghent European Council.
Secondly, while making the fight against terrorism a priority, we must not be diverted from other projects that are fundamental to European integration.
I would like to confirm here and now that the Belgian Presidency will make every effort to comply with its programme on preparing for the introduction of the euro, enlargement negotiations and the implementation of the European security and defence policy.
I would now like to turn to the preparation of the Ghent European Council.
(NL) The informal meeting of Heads of State and Government in Ghent on 19 October will consider the three subjects already identified by the Belgian Presidency, namely the euro, the enlargement of the European Union and the Laeken Declaration on the future of Europe.
In the wake of recent international developments, a fourth issue will probably be added to the agenda, namely the fight against terrorism.
With regard to the introduction of the euro coins and notes in 12 Member States on 1 January 2002, the President of the ECOFIN Council, Minister Reynders, the relevant European Commissioner, Mr Solbes, and the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Wim Duisenberg, will present a detailed report on the level of preparedness of the Member States.
The Heads of State and Government will thus have an opportunity to influence preparations, where necessary.
They will also have the opportunity to discuss some of the more political aspects of the euro, such as the use of the euro in the candidate countries.
With regard to the preparations for the Laeken Declaration, the President of the General Affairs Council will report on the talks held to date by the foreign affairs ministers on this subject.
In particular, the focus will be on the work done in this connection by the Belgian Presidency.
The progress made to date mostly concerns the organisation of the Convention as an innovative instrument paving the way for the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
The Belgian Presidency hopes to be able to consolidate this progress at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 and 9 October and then build on it with regard to two additional aspects: the status of the candidate countries at the Convention and the organisation of a Civil Forum.
What is more, the presidency would like to see a consensus reached on the best way of defining the Convention' s mandate.
The presidency would prefer to develop further or to reformulate the four themes of the Nice Declaration, with, of course, the objective of arriving at a broader agenda.
At the General Affairs Council of 8 October, the presidency will also give the Member States an initial indication of the possible structure of the Laeken Declaration.
The preparatory work done in the General Affairs Council should make it possible for the Heads of State and Government meeting in Ghent to push ahead gradually with the plans for the Laeken Declaration and, if possible, to make further progress in this domain.
Consequently, over the coming weeks, the presidency will strive, firstly, to convince the other Member States that the Laeken Declaration should not be limited simply to procedural matters; secondly, to explain the nature of the new elements affecting the Declaration' s content and, thirdly, to persuade the other Member States that this approach, in substance, should not pose any specific problems.
(FR) I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to reassure all those who have expressed reservations regarding the approach being recommended by the presidency.
The type of undertaking that we envisage does not give rise to insurmountable obstacles.
On the contrary, it offers up a number of advantages.
In my view, the question of knowing whether or not it is advisable to stick to the four topics of the Nice Declaration is not a genuine problem.
This declaration was worded in such a way so that it is possible to widen the debate, using the four topics listed as a basis.
Moreover, it is difficult to see what could prevent the Convention from taking the initiative on whatever subject it feels it would be useful to discuss.
It has been clear since our meeting in Genval that the Laeken Declaration will simply ask the questions and will not necessarily seek to give any pre-prepared answers.
The outcome of the Convention will be presented in the form of options, which should reassure all those who felt that their hand was being forced.
Lastly, while the aim of the exercise - which was acknowledged by all - is to ask the right questions, it is quite legitimate to seek to formulate them in the most complete, clear and pertinent manner in order to optimise the future work of the Convention.
Where the enlargement of the European Union is concerned, the European Council will be asked by the presidency to consider a report drafted by the European Commission on the implementation of a specific enlargement strategy.
This report will be available as soon as it is adopted by the college.
The aim in this respect is to check that the road map adopted by the Nice European Council and confirmed by the GÃ¶teborg European Council as a general framework for negotiation is being respected.
Lastly, I would like to stress that the presidency has no intention of drafting any written conclusions for the meeting of the Heads of State and Government.
I would like to thank Mr Michel.
I shall now give the floor to Mr Michel Barnier, who is speaking on behalf of the Commission.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September have changed the world, the drama of which event is shown by the way yesterday Article 5 (the assistance clause) of the North Atlantic Treaty was invoked for the first time in the history of the North Atlantic Alliance, thereby declaring that all NATO countries were required to engage in defence.
It is important, though, to point out that this challenge has been thrown down not only to the United States and the West but also to the community of nations as a whole.
I was told yesterday by someone from China - the People's Republic, not Taiwan - that fifty Chinese people were killed in New York.
That means to say that these terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center were an attack on nearly all the nations of the world.
It is therefore necessary that we act in solidarity with each other.
Getting to grips with terrorism is an intellectual, political, economic and military task, and it can only be done in the long term.
We say again that terrorism, in so far as its causes lie in Islamic lands - for that is where the terrorists are - is not to be confused with the peaceful Arab and Muslim world.
This must be repeated again and again!
I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for travelling to many countries in the company of Mr Solana and Mr Patten.
We will now also - Madam President, I thank you for your initiatives - be calling a meeting of the Mediterranean Forum, in order to consult with our parliamentary friends from the Mediterranean region.
I would counsel strongly against any inappropriate rhetoric!
I am not satisfied with what was said by Mr Nielson or by Mr Bolkestein.
We must be able to rely on a Commissioner' s speaking appropriately and in cautious terms.
We will discuss this on Thursday in the Conference of Presidents and, subject to the way these discussions go, our group reserves the right to call upon the President of the Commission and, if need be, the two Commissioners to elaborate here in the European Parliament on what they have said.
We now need more of Europe.
We will be no more than a partner of the USA even if we are capable of dealing not only with foreign, security, and defence policy, but also with internal security issues.
We need to cooperate with Russia.
We welcome the fact that President Putin is having talks today with Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council and with Mr Prodi as President of the Commission.
We want partnership with Russia, but the events of 11 September must not mean that we close our eyes to the human rights violations that are still going on in Chechnya.
On the contrary, we must say 'Yes' to combating violence and terrorism if it originates in Chechnya, but 'No' to war on the Chechen people.
We must also be an advocate for the rights of the Chechen people, within the Russian Federation of course.
For this reason, there must be recognition for the identity of peoples, which is one of the core values of the European Union.
It goes without saying that we must proceed with the World Trade Agreements as planned, for nothing could be worse than for us not to transact our normal day-to-day business.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you mentioned Ghent.
We support what you have said.
We ask you to send out a signal for renewed close cooperation in combating terrorism.
Not only should Europol and Eurojust, too, closely cooperate, but - in my personal judgment - this close cooperation is best guaranteed by their being based at one location.
We ask you to send a signal to the acceding countries, that they are welcome in the European Union if they comply with the conditions.
I am saying this as a German, for eleven years ago, on 3 October 1990, we were celebrating the unity of Germany, which was only possible because the road towards it was prepared by those Europeans who now wish to join the European Union.
What you have said about the preparation for the Laeken Convention meets with our approval.
Let me express my gratitude for the way your conception of it coheres with our own.
My final remark will be a personal challenge to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as much as to anyone else. We are all facing a challenge as regards the security of our institutions.
I must tell you that I feel safer here in Strasbourg - which has nothing to do with the place itself - but because we know that, here, the police are French.
When the President of the European Parliament gets a response from the Belgian authorities to the effect that greater protection for Parliament in Brussels is not necessary because there are no indications of attacks or such like, I find that justification far from adequate...
(Applause)
... but I call upon you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to have the European Parliament in Brussels more securely guarded by the security forces of the Kingdom of Belgium.
I am given to over-reaction even less than I am to panic, but we need protection and security wherever possible.
I ask you, in your capacity as the currently responsible President-in-Office of the Council to use your influence with the Belgian government so that the security of the European Parliament in Brussels may, so far as possible, be assured by Belgium.
(Applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group endorses the conclusions reached at the Extraordinary European Council at Brussels. The Council came at just the right time politically, and resulted in a sea change in the Union' s collective conscience.
I should like to recall that this change was initiated by the Watson Report in early September.
Unfortunately, it was not until after the attacks on Washington and New York that the Council woke up to the situation and began to press ahead, and we do welcome the change in approach.
I should like to emphasise that in our view it is very important for this action to be included in the framework of United Nations' Resolution 1368 (2001), as stated in the Council' s conclusions.
Kofi Annan' s proposal to establish a global convention against terrorism is also important. It is already under discussion in the United States and will receive the European Union' s full support.
Global responses to the globalisation of terrorism are called for.
However, in addition to this universal approach, there is a need to express solidarity with the United States.
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty was therefore invoked yesterday.
A clear definition at all levels of the nature of the fight against terrorism is also needed. This fight will not curtail freedoms, it is a fight to defend the intrinsic freedom of every individual, namely the right to life and the right not to be subjected to indiscriminate violence.
In this connection, Madam President, I believe the activities of the Justice and Home Affairs Council must be supported, as it works to consolidate both Europol and Eurojust. Common instruments must be developed, not only at European level but also within our respective countries.
In this connection I feel it should be pointed out that Parliament can come under pressure from lobbying groups.
This is already happening.
The lobbying groups are very adept at exerting pressure or influence on the Commission and the Council. Please take note of this, Mr President, and pass it on to Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council.
I believe we should respect the activities of others. I have in mind, in particular, the criticism of our activities in connection with the directive on money laundering.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should also like to express my group' s disquiet concerning the legislation passed by the Italian Senate yesterday. It is entirely contradictory to your aims, and will hinder judicial cooperation and the fight against terrorism because its provisions make cooperation at judicial level quite impossible.
(Applause from the left and protests from the right) Madam President, I must appeal to my colleague Mr Poettering ...
Surely, Madam President, this is a civilised House and those who resort to barracking have no place in it.
I am addressing my colleague Mr Poettering too. He is very concerned about the statements made by certain Commissioners.
My group would like all Commissioners to explain themselves before this House.
Mr Poettering ought to confer with his political friends, especially with the Prime Minister of Italy, to ensure that no statements are made to undermine the European Union's action here and in the wider world.
In addition, Madam President, I should like to comment on the Ghent Council. The measures taken so far concerning the euro are good, and it is an important issue.
However, we need to strengthen our economic capacity so we can respond to the world crisis. It is for the Council to do so, because it is essential for us to define an anticyclical policy and put it in place.
Further, with regard to enlargement, and here I am addressing all the political groups in this House, we must make a commitment on the basis of what you achieve at Ghent, and of the Commission' s progress report. This has to come back to Parliament.
I should like to highlight one point.
There is a lot of talk of progress along the road, and about the road map. However, we need to check whether the road and the road map will eventually lead to the same destination and whether it will be possible to comply with Parliament' s request that the countries involved should participate in the 2004 elections.
In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to make three comments on the Convention.
Firstly, I understand that the Convention has already been adopted.
Secondly, the Convention is to be established on the basis of its composition when preparing the Charter.
Thirdly, when you refer to options, are you not speaking of coherent proposals by the Convention?
The Convention is not a research body, nor is it a seminar.
The Convention is required to present proposals. The latter sometimes involve two options, but they are never options to be accepted or rejected.
We do not wish to be involved in that kind of game.
(Applause from the left)
Madam President, the Liberal Democrats in this House welcome the decisions of the extraordinary European Council.
We are pleased that it took on board proposals from this House in the field of justice and home affairs on combating terrorism and indeed that it reviewed the Union's policies in other areas to ensure that we have joined-up thinking in our approach to this very serious problem.
We regret, however, that it took a shock like the bombing of the Twin Towers and the Pentagon to push the Union into using the legal powers that it has under the Treaty of Amsterdam to act in fighting terrorism.
Liberal Democrats welcome particularly the Commission's proposals of yesterday for a Council Regulation to freeze the assets of terrorist groups.
We note its request for urgency and will be pushing this morning within the committee I have the honour to chair to make a recommendation to Parliament this afternoon to adopt those proposals.
I hope that the Committee of Permanent Representatives meeting this morning will add its request for urgency to that of the Commission.
The need for action in this area throws into sharp relief the weaknesses and the contradictions of the European Union post-Amsterdam. These were not dealt with properly at Nice.
I hope they will be dealt with at Laeken and through the convention which will be established.
Commissioner Patten yesterday rightly lamented the inability of the European Union to act fast in situations like this and thus to enjoy the confidence of its Member States and to coordinate the policies of its Member States in an area where a supranational threat requires a supranational response.
At times like this the Union must act fast, but finds it cannot act fast.
The mechanisms of the third pillar leave Mr bin Laden laughing all the way to the cash machine.
I challenge the national governments to explain to our citizens why Europe has been incapable of acting fast because of the curious and complicated mechanisms of the third pillar.
When we act fast we find that we need urgency and urgency frequently leads to bad law.
We cannot continue to adopt the necessary security measures for our citizens in a way which is infelicitous for the Union's institutions, incomprehensible to our citizens and ineffective because it allows for no proper legal, democratic or administrative control of decisions.
I hope that the convention set up by Laeken will look at invoking Article 42 of the TEU to bring these policy areas fully within the core competences of the Union.
Many measures will be needed in the coming months.
Commissioner Vitorino has provided us with an anti-terrorism road map outlining such measures.
Clearly, in our consideration of these, a delicate balance will need to be struck between the security needs of our citizens and the civil liberties which make our democracy what it is.
The President-in-Office said this morning that we should not be blown off course on our other agendas.
I agree with him.
Those agendas include our agenda to consolidate citizens' rights within the Union and our agenda of anti-discrimination.
Liberals in this House will defend, with the President-in-Office, the rights of EU citizens.
The House has received a proposed regulation on the freezing of assets.
That regulation could potentially, depending on its implementation, have a disastrous effect on many legitimate Muslim-owned businesses.
Therefore Liberals will be calling for a sunset clause in that regulation giving it a limited life to make sure that it is not being abused in its implementation.
We look forward to proposals from the Council for the involvement of the European Parliament in determining the names that will be put on the list in the annex to that regulation.
In conclusion, Article 6 says that the Union is founded on rights.
The Charter defines those rights and we hope that the convention will agree to insert the Charter fully into the Treaties.
Commissioner, the European Union is facing several major challenges, which it will have to meet as quickly as possible if it wants to mount an effective, coherent and long-term campaign against terrorism, with particular reference to breaking up the terrorist networks.
Several colleagues have already discussed the first challenge, namely to avoid a clash of civilisations with the Islamic world.
In that context, let me take advantage of Mr Michel's presence and congratulate him on his diplomatic activity over the past weeks, which, I believe, is bound to produce positive results in terms of establishing a very broad coalition against terrorism and its supporters.
Creating a very broad coalition means, of course, securing the participation of as many countries as possible, but without losing sight of the fact that our enemies' enemies are not always our friends and realising that no state that forms part of this coalition is exempt from its duties in regard to democracy, the protection of human rights and respect for minorities.
I am thinking in particular of Russia and China, which are of course important players but also cause us serious concern in this respect.
The second challenge, and it is certainly not insignificant, is to strengthen police and judicial cooperation without compromising individual rights and freedoms.
In fact here, in the European Union, the parliamentary control is totally inadequate.
I therefore think, and I believe we agree fairly unanimously, that it is important to include judicial and police cooperation in the first pillar.
That would certainly be one answer.
Furthermore, at international level, we urgently need to set up the International Criminal Court, a process that has been underway for several years but is now marking time. Let me point out that we vitally need this kind of court to try crimes against humanity, such as those committed in New York and Washington.
We will have to mount a large-scale diplomatic action to persuade as many states as possible to support this project, in particular the United States, which is after all a vital player.
The third challenge is the problem of depriving the terrorist networks of their means of action, both financial and technical.
We have already raised the subject of financing; we have a draft directive on money laundering that is currently making little progress and I think an effort needs to be made in the dialogue between the Council and Parliament to ensure that this directive is adopted quickly. Moreover, we must realise that this is a first step; it does not go far enough but it is a determining step.
In the long term, I am convinced we will be forced to take large-scale action to outlaw and abolish offshore banking and tax havens.
Money laundering is obviously an important weapon in the hands of international terrorist groups and international terrorist networks.
I was struck by some information, which has not been denied, to the effect that even before the New York and Washington attacks it appears that shares in some companies - and I am thinking in particular of the two American airline companies and several insurance companies that were affected by the attack - were jettisoned just before the attacks.
This could be regarded as insider dealing and I think that at the very least we need an international inquiry to check this information.
Finally, let me turn to the technical level, technical being, of course, a euphemism for arms. Clearly the European Union will have to intensify its fight against illegal and uncontrolled exports of light arms and keep a close eye on the fundamental problem of the proliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons.
I believe that we cannot avoid the need to take a longer-term look at the vulnerability of some of our technological tools to acts of terrorism.
I am thinking, for example, of energy, of the risks posed by nuclear power stations, the majority of which are highly vulnerable to the types of action committed in the United States.
Madam President, once again, we declare our condemnation of any form of terrorism, whatever its source.
As well as destroying human life, terrorism takes any possibility or capacity for democratic initiative away from the huge numbers of men and women who are fighting to change the unjust social and economic system of this world.
Moreover, we condemn any attempt to assert the non-existent superiority of the moral, cultural or political systems of the communities of the European Union over other communities.
We believe that, at this moment in history, one of the ways in which the European Union can combat and isolate any form of violence is to make a concerted effort to achieve the objective of giving the peoples of Israel and Palestine two autonomous, sovereign States, as stipulated in all those UN resolutions which Israel has been violating for years.
The internal security of the Union must be reinforced - and I agree with much of what Mr Watson said - but always and only in respect for fundamental rights and the constraints of the rule of law.
Therefore, any extension of the competences or spheres of operation of bodies such as Europol or Eurojust must go hand in hand with the creation of a system of judicial and, most importantly, democratic controls, with Parliament playing an active role.
Any attempt to use the danger represented by terrorism to restrict or eliminate, by any means including Union or national legislative instruments, the huge democratic waves of dissent and opposition to the dominant social and economic system which are now sweeping through Europe and the world, must therefore be rejected, just as those legislative practices also referred to by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo such as the Italian laws on international letters rogatory, which are of practical assistance to terrorist and organised crime groups, must be condemned.
We hope that the fight against terrorism, which is a crime against humanity, will increasingly be seen as the responsibility of the entire international community, that is of the UN, rather than the responsibility of a small number of wealthy, powerful nations who often use their wealth and power not to combat terrorism and its causes but to consolidate their economic and political power.
The fact that the majority of the people in the world live in a state of despair, poverty and underdevelopment can never justify terrorism - never. This situation must be fought and eradicated by action, not just formal declarations, if we want our world to be at peace.
This is another area in which we must take action if we genuinely want to eliminate terrorism.
Mr President, EU leaders met in Ghent on 21 September to evaluate how the Union should react to the horrific terrorist attacks in America.
I welcome the solidarity which all EU leaders showed with the American government and the American people in their time of mourning and grief.
I also very much welcome the concrete plan of action that EU leaders are now going to implement in an effort to tackle international terrorism head-on.
But let me be clear about one point. As a result of the terrorist attacks on 11 September it is now clear to us all that people are willing to engage in well-organised suicide missions to further their own political goals.
That means, in the simplest terms, that we are going to have to implement wide-ranging measures if we are going to be in a position to defeat the scourge of international terrorism.
In line with the conclusions of the Tampere Summit, EU leaders are committed to introducing a European arrest warrant, designed to supplant the current system of extradition in Europe.
Easing extradition, while protecting civil rights, is an important weapon in the fight against terrorism, and in particular within the Union, where free movement of persons exists.
The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism is also going to be ratified in all Member States of the European Union.
Our finance ministers are going to bring forward proposals outlining a timetable for the implementation of the draft directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.
The financial task force run by the OECD will be broadened to cover the issue of combating money laundering.
There is agreement to implement the framework directive permitting the freezing of criminal assets within the Union.
There has also been agreement on paying closer attention to the draft directive on insider dealing so as to guarantee that all activities linked to terrorism come under the auspices of the directive.
Intelligence agencies within the Member States of the Union, together with Europol, must work together more closely in terms of exchanging intelligence information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken.
Finally, fanatical terrorism is difficult to defeat, but we must be prepared to be determined and vigorous in the counter-terrorism measures that we introduce.
We must all work together.
A united front, spearheaded by the Union and the United States, will be the only means of enabling us to defeat these cold-blooded and ruthless murderers.
Mr President, the summit is now to discuss the composition of the Convention that is to draft the EU' s constitution.
A majority of MEPs want to see the European Parliament' s representation doubled from 16 to 30.
The argument is made in terms of equality with the national parliaments which each had two Members in the Charter Convention, making a total of 30.
The name of my political group refers to a 'Europe of Democracies' in order to emphasise that we want democracy in the individual countries and democratic control of the EU.
Democracies can govern the EU jointly, but there is no European people, as such, to have given the European Parliament a mandate to negotiate a new constitution for the EU.
My group and the intergroup SOS Democracy instead proposes that we let each individual national parliament present proposals for the next treaty and then let representatives of the national parliaments prepare the draft treaty that is to replace the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The Commission, Parliament and the governments could be observers in such an assembly.
We would, at the same time, call upon the prime ministers to pledge that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the Member States.
A treaty adopted in a referendum could bear the insignia 'more democracy' rather than 'more Union' .
We should like to create a slimmer EU with greater freedom for the Member States: an open and democratic EU that is close to the people and is governed by electorates and elected representatives in the Member States; a more flexible Europe, open to the candidate countries and to all other European nations.
'A democratic EU' sounds all well and good, but it can only come about when there is a European public.
A living democracy requires a common language, culture, media, treasury of songs and sense of internal interdependence: in short, a European people.
A 'Europe of democracies' is the art of the possible.
The EU should be put on a slimming course and the focus shifted to cross-border matters which we cannot control as individual nations.
In that way, there would be no loss of democracy but a benefit in terms of shared influence, and the people of Europe would vote in favour of the next treaty.
Would they do so today, Mr President-in-Office of the Council?
Dare you allow the Belgians to vote on the Treaty of Nice?
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Mr Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, first a word on the defence aspect.
Much has been said about air safety and security, many measures have been taken at European level.
Curiously, though, there is not a word about our secret services; in fact, if there are a number of organisations that did not work, at any rate in the 15 Member States, they certainly include our secret services.
Today we see them digging away and finding out all sorts of things.
Perhaps it would have been better if they had discovered some of them beforehand.
They cost us dear.
Nobody is quite sure what they do; sometimes we wonder whether they do anything.
No doubt that too could be a subject worth considering at European level and subjecting to parliamentary control, for they can present a risk: so long as we leave them total freedom of action, they will sometimes take inappropriate action.
Turning to the offensive aspect, yesterday the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Michel, provided the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with a great deal of information.
He strongly emphasised the value of dialogue.
However, I think that unless this dialogue is accompanied by a political project, it may risk merely reinforcing certain positions.
We are currently endeavouring to forge an anti-terrorist coalition.
There are, in my view, two main risks.
Mr Poettering highlighted one of them: the measures to combat terrorism risk - and it is more than a risk, since they have already produced some very adverse results - provoking and encouraging state terrorism.
Mr Poettering specifically stated - and I thank him because authorised voices in his country, like that of Mr SchrÃ¶der, seemed to agree with Mr Putin, who has still not provided us with a shred of evidence that the Chechens were responsible for the Moscow attacks, a point Mr Lannoye also emphasised - that it can be tempting to use this great anti-terrorist battle to settle a few scores at home, in Tibet for the Chinese, in Chechnya for the Russians, etc. That is an aspect we must bear in mind.
The other issue is the Arab world.
There has been much criticism of certain statements that were made.
I believe we all agree that this is not a clash of civilisation between Islam and Christianity but, obviously, a clash of civilisation between democracy and non-democracy and that we have to take the offensive in that conflict.
We must help all those people in the Arab countries, in the Muslim countries, who are fighting, often at the price of their freedom, at the price of torture, and often at the price of death; and this Parliament, our European Union, is certainly not doing enough in that respect.
Examples such as Morocco and Jordan show that the Arab countries can move towards democracy.
Other countries that might have gone the same way have in fact done the opposite, such as Tunisia: in fact, it would not take much to change the course in that country, which has a ruling class, a cultured class, an education system, and which recognises the rights of women, the equal rights of men and women.
In that respect our policy is aiding and abetting Mr Ben Ali in consolidating a regime that is moving further away from the rule of law every day and is becoming enclosed in a vicious circle of state gangsterism.
An offensive policy means supporting the people of Tunisia who are working for the rule of law, for freedom.
Mr President, the MPF delegation members approve both the 'solidarity and cooperation with the United States' and the 'European policy' headings of the action plan against terrorism adopted by the extraordinary European Council of 21 September.
However, we feel the practical value of introducing a European arrest warrant and a common definition of terrorism have been rather overestimated.
Similarly, it may seem a good idea in theory to give Europol new powers, but this organisation is not doing very well as it is and first we would have to call for an independent and objective audit of the way it operates.
But these are all secondary issues.
Overall, we approve the Council's conclusions.
In particular, we welcome the establishment of Eurojust, which is to develop forms of judicial and police cooperation and create synergy between the existing systems instead of trying to demolish them.
Like the Council, we also call for the speedy ratification of all existing international conventions, like the convention on the financing of terrorism, whose implementation has been seriously delayed.
However, in spite of all that, Mr President, we are still not happy.
That brings me to my main point.
Although the Council adopted long lists of actions to be undertaken, they remain one-off measures and the European Union is still not really prepared to examine its own conscience.
It would be difficult to deny that the inquiry into the 11 September attacks is currently concentrating on Europe and that it shows that, for years now, the terrorists have been centring their preparations in Europe, which they have used as their base.
All this is not pure chance.
The day after the attacks, a French newspaper interviewed the current president of Eurojust, Mrs Coninsx, asking her the following question, and I quote from the article: 'is the loose Islamist conglomeration strongly established in Europe?'
Mrs Coninsx, head of Eurojust, replied: 'Europe may act as a logistical fallback for these terrorists.
It is, indeed, fairly easy to cross frontiers because of the Schengen area' .
Everyone knows that.
It is true for the terrorists, but it is also true for fissile materials, it is true for stolen works of art, it is true for illegal immigrants, etc. In fact it was only yesterday and in this very place that I accused the Commission of all too often concealing the problems of illegal immigration.
Europol informs us that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter EU territory every year, a figure that I actually think is an underestimate.
At any rate, it means that millions of foreigners live on our soil permanently and illegally.
So let me ask you: if countries let in millions of foreigners without discovering them and allow them to live there illegally, can they be regarded as in control of their territory?
Obviously you will all say 'no' .
It is now up to the Council, and the Council alone, to issue strong instructions in order to restore some balance.
The President of the Council has rightly said that the fight against terrorism will be global and sustained.
We have to draw all the necessary conclusions from that, discard outdated points of view, give priority to security, review all the old strategies that are no longer appropriate and begin by admitting that controls do not prejudice freedom of movement; while they harm criminals they protect citizens' freedoms.
The Council must, therefore, call immediately for a list of all the documents that need reviewing from a security point of view and, in particular, that disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which promises a total absence of any kind of control of individuals at the internal frontiers five years after its entry into force.
We need a general review plan, of which the Council must be directly in charge.
That means we need to review Article 67 of the Treaty of Amsterdam...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Since the attacks of 11 September, the world has been on tenterhooks.
People are shocked.
They feel for the victims and those left behind, and their own sense of security has reached an all-time low.
People expect their governments to guarantee their safety.
They realise that this is not wholly possible but they are asking for efficient and conclusive action, and rightly so.
Anyone who is responsible for security these days has a complex task to fulfil.
The need for true, European integration and international coordination has been brought into focus more than ever, both in words and deeds.
Mr President, I very much hope that you will be able to carry out your action plan of 21 September effectively, and that the Belgian Presidency will be able to take specific decisions in this connection.
We have all asserted that the attacks were not so much directed at innocent victims as at the symbols of freedom, democracy and human rights, including the right to life.
Nobody will deny that the European Parliament too is a symbol of these values.
Of course, we do not want to proclaim ourselves as targets, nor do we want to spread panic, but many MEPs are worried, as already stated by group chairman, Mr Poettering.
In Strasbourg, the entrances and the immediate surroundings of this building are under police surveillance.
In Brussels, however, we are even denied the illusion of security.
If, moreover, we infer from the words of the Belgian Minister for the Interior here that he sees no indication of a need for tighter security, then we have a real reason to worry.
For terrorists do not give warnings, something which a Minister for the Interior should realise.
That is why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would like to ask you to persuade your Minister for the Interior and the police in Belgium to think again.
Not only in the interests of the safety of the MEPs of the 15 Member States, but also in the interests of their colleagues, their visitors, the safety of the city, which is the capital of Europe, and in the interest of the values for which we all stand.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are Europe's tasks in these times?
First, Europe must support the victim against the aggressor.
We hold to our treaty commitments.
We salute the firm and considered attitude of the United States government.
We also welcome the European Council's expression of solidarity with the USA.
All of you must make it your concern that Europe is not divided into doves and hawks!
Secondly, the European Union must play its part in forging a worldwide political alliance against terrorism.
We appreciate what you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, with Mr Solana and Mr Patten, have undertaken not only in the Arab countries but also in Russia.
We ask that you continue your efforts as intermediaries in the Middle East, above all between Israel and the Palestinians.
They are in the best interests of us all.
Thirdly, we must, join together in reinforcing our internal security.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is regrettable that the European Council, and the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers as well, have only now got around to partially implementing plans that already existed and had been thoroughly worked out.
We expect action against terrorism, not reactions to terrorist attacks.
In doing this, Europe must continue to be an example of how to maintain the balance between the right to individual liberty and the security of all.
Fourthly, we want Europeans not to be distracted from their common commitment to a more just world order, in which law for all replaces force exerted by the few.
We are not making this effort for a more just world order solely out of a belief that we will thereby be depriving terrorism of its breeding ground.
On the contrary, we seek a more just world order because that reflects our values and our dignity as Europeans - a dignity we share with all the peoples of the earth!
Fifthly, if it is true to say that the world is no longer what it was before 11 September, then the European Union cannot stay as it is.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we welcome your intentions for Ghent and Laeken.
We hope they do not remain only as intentions but that what you have put before us will indeed become the opinion of the Fifteen and a basis for our further work.
Europe could be broken by the crisis now facing the world. It could, though, equally, emerge stronger from it.
It is at this crossroads that you and all of us will be standing in Ghent and Laeken.
In this crisis, Europe can - and I would add - must show its citizens what the European Union is really worth.
By this yardstick you and all of us will be judged.
Mr President, 11 September will go down in history.
It will create a new framework for our daily lives and our political work.
The subtitles on CNN have read 'America at war' for a long time now.
Europe has been there.
Europe has been at war.
Europe has experience of being a theatre of war.
The United States has helped us in the past, and we in turn must therefore, of course, help the United States now.
However, Europe also knows that wars are not won with weapons alone.
Conflicts cannot be prevented with weapons.
Wars cannot be won with weapons alone and, above all, peace cannot be built with the aid of weapons alone.
It may be the case that weapons are necessary, but we must be clear that other things are also required.
I should like to highlight two things that are necessary to the European agenda.
The first is the urgent proposal we are debating at present.
It is regrettable that it is only now that we are debating such a proposal.
I wish to endorse what other speakers have said.
I should like to emphasise that there is, of course, a reason why we are only discussing the proposal now.
Far too many people have too many financial interests in this matter.
There are too many people who do not wish to reveal what is in their hidden accounts.
That is why it has been impossible for Europe to do anything before now, and it may well also prove quite difficult now.
The second thing I want to say is that, if we do not gather grassroots support for further European cooperation, we shall lack the communal spirit needed to stand firm against terrorists.
Mr President, yesterday, Mr Nielson stood here and reported on the situation in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan was on the list of forgotten countries before 11 September. Now, however, the situation has become all but catastrophic.
The World Bank has produced a report showing that between 20000 and 40 000 children per day will die of hunger because of the economic recession caused by the events of 11 September.
In the EU' s Member States, we have received a report to the effect that foreigners and refugees are being persecuted.
This is shown by the Monitoring Centre on Racism in its report.
We are, of course, all appalled at what happened on 11 September, but what these events showed us first and foremost was, of course, that the world has shrunk and that no one is safe.
The American missile shield would not have helped in this situation. Nor did all the American military hardware help, either.
Now, we are moving on to talk about the need to strengthen democracy and dialogue. However, the anti-terrorism package we have debated - not the one concerning the economy, but the other - reeks of distrust.
The ambition to strengthen the police and intelligence services completely overshadows the fight to strengthen human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
We will not accept increased powers, either for Europol or the intelligence services, until we have got them under democratic control.
Combating terrorism must not overshadow freedoms of expression and assembly.
I should like to ask whether there is anyone who believes that our world will become safer when we prohibit certain organisations.
Terrorism, killing, robbery and the destruction of property are to be forbidden, Well, they are already forbidden.
Those responsible must be caught, and they must be punished.
I do not wish to defend anti-democratic organisations, but the question is whether our world will become safer if these organisations go underground and are made illegal.
There are limits to the number of problems that can be solved by legislation alone, and I think that the first package is evidence of more haste, less speed.
Our task must be to remove the basis for terrorism.
I therefore think that the Troika initiative was a step in the right direction and one that favoured dialogue and the creation of a broad alliance to combat terrorism.
However, there are problems in the alliance.
When China demands, as a condition of its being a part of the alliance, that we close our eyes to what is happening in Tibet; when Russia demands that we close our eyes to events in Chechnya; when Turkey demands that we close our eyes to the fate of the Kurds; and when Israel demands that we close our eyes to the situation of the Palestinians, then we do not have a safe world.
There must be security for all, including oppressed people and also the 20 000 to 40 000 children who will die of hunger next year.
Mr President, the writing on Commander Massoud' s tombstone reads: "Here lies a man who was like an angel: let him guide you.
His name is Massoud" .
We must follow him and defend those who are fighting terrorism, trying to restore their people' s freedom, democracy and human rights.
Yet we did not help Commander Massoud when he came to Strasbourg in April to condemn the crimes of the Taliban. Let us at least help the Afghan people and the civilised world to overcome terrorists and fundamentalists.
However, our statements of condemnation must be followed by practical action: words alone are not enough.
Therefore, we wonder why it is that the terrorists' bank accounts are only being frozen now, if the governments and intelligence were already aware of these accounts before.
Why have the Internet sites which continue to promote terrorist initiatives and maintain links with subversive cells throughout the world, recruiting new terrorists all the while, not yet been condemned and closed?
We call for the Community funding and financing programmes aiding those governments which are not joining the alliance to combat terrorism and, in any case, continue to harbour terrorists on their territory, to be frozen immediately.
Mr President, the possible establishment of a Convention is taking up most of the attention in the debate on the future of the European Union.
This morning, I would like to draw your attention to another point, namely the timeframe for the preparation of the next IGC.
It is understandable that this Parliament does not want an IGC in 2004, for that is the year when elections will be held and the Commission steps down.
However, would 2003, as Parliament suggested, be a good alternative?
In the Netherlands, we have a saying 'haastige spoed is zelden goed' (more haste, less speed).
When one considers the weighty subjects on the agenda, it very much confirms that more time should be taken to reflect.
Moreover, the topics of the IGC are sufficiently interesting to be the subject of the election battle.
In addition, it is also necessary to give the applicant states a vote in this important debate.
In short, 2003 is far too early and 2004 is far too hectic.
Could the Council not decide to hold the IGC in 2005?
Mr President, the attacks in New York and in Washington also claimed many of our own citizens.
That means, therefore, that there is more than simply a display of solidarity on our part.
We are united in our fate. It is therefore logical that Article 5 of the NATO Treaty has been invoked, which means that we are involved in NATO responses every step of the way.
We carry full responsibility, and we must therefore be aware of the reactions that are heading our way.
All the terrorists wanted to attain was chaos and unreasoning revenge.
The response to that must be measured and specifically targeted at the people and organisations responsible.
The security instruments must be comprehensively reinforced.
That is why I agree that Europol and Eurojust should clearly be given more scope and be integrated into a constitutional state structure.
The European arrest warrant, the common definition of terrorism and organised crime, more flexible extradition: these are all vital instruments.
Member State Ministers who tire themselves out producing objections will undoubtedly be considered 'useful idiots' - to use a term from the cold war era.
What more is needed to enable us to safeguard our common internal security, whereby the sovereignty of Member States is used to benefit the citizens in a way that does not conflict with their interests?
Every Member State should realise that if they offer sanctuary to criminals who seek the necessary peace and quiet to plan their crimes, they themselves can become targets.
The improvement of international relations also strengthens international security.
That is why we need to make good use of the structures in place, such as the Mediterranean dialogue and the United Nations.
Contact with certain sections of the Afghan population is necessary, particularly in the interests of providing relief to those in need.
The resolution which came about under the competent guidance of Mr Collins receives our full support.
We would only like to adopt one single amendment from the old, socialist resolution, and replace Article 26 on Gibraltar with our own wording.
Apart from that, we give our wholehearted approval to the joint outcome.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will reply quickly to some of the questions; unfortunately I have to be fairly brief because I cannot stay till the end of the sitting.
Let me begin with some further information about the convention.
Several Members raised this matter.
I think it is important to say, since the question was asked, that the principle of holding a convention to prepare for the IGC has, I believe, been accepted.
It has also, of course, been agreed that representatives of the governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and the European Parliament, that is, a quadripartite group, will take part.
This participation could take the following form: government representatives - possibly numbering 15 - 16 MEPs, 30 members of national parliaments and one Commission representative.
However, I am not going to start a debate about numbers at this point.
What is important to remember is that the number of participants in this convention must be reduced somewhat.
It must not be exponential. Of course, we could try to please everyone, but then we would end up with a convention that was not viable.
