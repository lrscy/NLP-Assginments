Mr President, there is no question in my mind that we all want to see the eradication of hooliganism in football at a European level and globally.
However, we must be careful not to do so in a manner that would restrict the enjoyment of the real supporters.
The issue must, therefore, be discussed at a European level, and we should guard against becoming embroiled in local discussions on the capacity and safety of specific stadiums, wherever they might be.
We must ask ourselves why measures taken in the past have repeatedly failed to create a culture of enjoyment in football for everybody.
I welcome the dialogue under way now between the Commission and sports and football clubs on how matters could improve.
The people who run the game are the people who, through constructive dialogue, will eventually be able to find answers to the blight of hooliganism and, it must be said, racism affecting this most popular of all sports.
Mr President, we must take these issues of hooliganism seriously.
We know now that there are tens of millions of people who are passionate about this sport and that, since the World Cup was won by France, they have been impatiently awaiting Euro 2000.
Football has become a sport of the masses and we must think about the safety of our children, our little brothers and the youngsters who frequent the stadiums.
We cannot therefore just say that there are risks and there will always be risks.
We must try to counter this phenomenon of hooliganism to the best of our ability.
I say this because we cannot allow the good image of genuine supporters to be tarnished by the actions of a few violent extremists who use these major gatherings as a pretext for carrying out unacceptable acts.
The motion is good in that it indicates that adequate safety measures must be taken.
During the last World Cup you will remember that hooligans committed very serious acts of violence. One in particular involved an attack on a police officer who was in a coma for a long time and who is now paralysed for life.
All this is not inevitable and we must find the means, for example, of punishing hooligans in the countries of the European Union in which they commit their offences.
In this respect I believe there to have been a recent example in France which is very important.
For years, under the Nazi banner, French hooligans monopolised a stand at the Parc des Princes in Paris.
They took advantage of matches to vent their hatred, chant Nazi slogans and chase blacks and Arabs on leaving the ground.
The Paris St. Germain club allowed this to happen and even ended up blocking access to the stand in question for any dark skinned person on the pretext of safety.
Following a complaint from the French association, SOS-Racisme, and faced with the threat of prosecution, the club undertook to end this behaviour and to no longer allow the hooligans into the stadium by strictly screening people as they enter.
Before every match, right to the end of the season, Paris St. Germain now shows an anti-racist video clip which celebrates the values of friendship and brotherhood and the pleasures of the sport.
This proves that action can be taken and that violence is not inevitable. I truly believe that, when you think about what football has become, with tens of thousands of youngsters in these stadia, this shows that we really must try to be careful and not take these matters lightly.
Mr President, the PPE-DE does not support the resolution of the British delegates and has announced that it is to withdraw it later on, not because we would not want to condemn the increasing violence as a result of football matches, but because the resolution is too restrictive and insubstantial as it stands and, to that extent, does not belong in this Chamber.
Surely it is not up to us to get involved in the politics of one specific match at a specific venue and make technical statements about the suitability of one football stadium for one Euro 2000 match?
It would have been much better to point out - and I would like to do so on behalf of many PPE-DE colleagues - that, first of all, safety is an essential good over which extreme care is to be taken and for which many efforts are being made with regard to Euro 2000.
Secondly, all those responsible for safety at Euro 2000 are called on to operate in an extremely preventive manner.
Thirdly, the police forces of all participating countries must be encouraged to negotiate obstacles which would hinder extensive collaboration.
Fourthly, we would like to call on all those involved - organisers, players and supporters - to observe fair play.
It is unfortunate that this resolution led to a match between Belgium and England, first within the PPE-DE and later on in this Chamber, too.
I do hope that this match finishes in a sportsmanlike way and I hope that the Belgians will not just win here but also a number of matches during Euro 2000.
Mr President, hooliganism is not a borderline phenomenon but clearly takes the form of a subculture and is, as such, difficult to control.
In my opinion, zero tolerance is the only way to systematically tackle any infringement and efficiently penalise any breach.
The content of the current resolution overlooks the causes of hooliganism, whether or not consciously.
It is clear that the initiators of the resolution are more concerned with slating the organisation of Euro 2000.
The Liberals, however, refuse to play this game.
We can appreciate the enormous efforts which the governments of the organising countries have made in order to make Euro 2000 run as smoothly as possible.
All we want to do on the eve of Euro 2000 is to call on each and every one who bears responsibility to exercise the greatest possible alertness so as to reach the set goal, namely to turn Euro 2000 into a party for hundreds of thousands of spectators and millions of viewers, a party which should help us project a positive European image.
Mr President, we are unable to support the submitted resolution.
I was in favour of discussing the topic of hooliganism but this resolution can at best be described as agenda pollution.
This Parliament should not be discussing safety during one particular Euro 2000 match under pressure from what I assume is a portion of British public opinion.
It is also an insult to - in this case - the Belgian organisers of this game and the international authorities involved.
This is a great pity because extensive discussions can be held about the fight against hooliganism itself.
In addition, we continue to learn important lessons, such as for example, how we should really guide the fans?
How can we better educate club managers and organisers of games?
Attention should also be given to the so-called 'second opinion' which is now being applied, by means of which a group outside the organisation analyses the measures taken and suggests improvements.
Mr President, hooligans have managed to spoil the fun of the real fans too often.
It will be different at Euro 2000, as this will be a football party for everyone.
Mr President, I will begin in the Philippines and end, such is the reach and range of the European Parliament, with football.
The Commission shares the honourable Members' concern for the health and safety of the hostages in Jolo and Basilan.
We strongly condemn such terrorist actions.
We were, of course, fully associated with the decision to send the EU High Representative, Javier Solana, to the Philippines.
Mr Solana was sent to convey personally to the Philippine government the European Union' s message concerning the safety of the hostages.
He received assurances from the government of the Philippines that military force would not be used to liberate them.
We are following events in Mindanao and the neighbouring islands closely.
We are concerned at the escalation of political violence that has taken place after the suspension of the peace negotiations between the government of the Philippines and various armed groups.
We believe that only an early resumption of peace negotiations, as requested by the leaders of civil society and of religious groups, offers prospects for a lasting improvement of the situation in Mindanao.
I should wish to add one final point about the 21 hostages - seven of them are European Union citizens.
Obviously, we all hope for their early release.
Our thoughts are, I am sure, with their families.
I hope, too, that we will receive early news about the welfare of the journalists who went to cover the story and have subsequently gone missing.
I hope that their whereabouts will soon be discovered.
Moving on to Equatorial Guinea.
We have been closely monitoring the human rights situation there for several years.
We share the concerns of the European Parliament about the local elections there.
Those concerns were reflected in the presidency declaration at the beginning of May.
During a recent mission by the Commission services, the issues that Parliament is addressing were raised directly with the President.
An official request for an electoral monitoring mission was sent on 2 May by the Equatorial Guinea government to Commissioner Nielson.
An answer containing detailed reasons for the refusal is being sent by the Commission to President Obiang.
The request from the government of Guinea-Bissau arrived very late and, in keeping with our guidelines, electoral observation missions should be prepared at an early stage in the electoral process so that we can ensure that the process is accurate and fair.
It is relevant that the opposition parties in Equatorial Guinea have contested the electoral lists and have already decided to boycott the ballot.
We therefore consider that, at this stage, the presence of international observers would not only fail to improve the quality and the transparency of the local elections, there is also a very real risk that this mission could be misused by local authorities as a way to legitimise an unsatisfactory process.
However, we intend to involve ourselves in promoting the process of democratisation in Equatorial Guinea.
On Iran, the Commission fully shares Parliament' s concern over the lack of freedom of expression there.
In the comprehensive dialogue between the European Union and Iran, questions regarding human rights, including press freedom, are regularly raised by the Commission.
The Iranian authorities are well aware of the importance we attach to these issues.
Clearly the present position is a very delicate one: the opponents of reform have used their control of the judiciary and of the security forces to intimidate intellectuals and to ban reformist papers.
The current trial of the 13 Jews on charges of espionage is also very disturbing.
The reformists have remained calm, and so should we, hoping that the convening of parliament will shortly help improve the situation.
I turn to Burma.
We deplore the continued violation of human rights by the Burmese military regime.
In particular, we deplore the continued extra-judicial killings, the widespread imposition of forced labour and the forced displacement of local populations, as well as the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the free functioning of legitimate political parties.
This includes the restrictions on the freedom of movement of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and the routine practice of arbitrary arrests.
We have strongly supported the EU common position on Burma and the decision of the April 2000 General Affairs Council to strengthen that common position.
We use every opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge, what is called - with a touch of George Orwell - the "State Peace and Development Council" to enter into a substantial dialogue with the democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities with a view to arriving at a mutually agreed internal solution to the problems of Burma and to respect for international human rights standards there.
Lastly, on football hooliganism: the responsibility for ensuring adequate safety for spectators and players during the Euro 2000 matches lies with the relevant national authorities and the relevant football associations.
I just wish to make two additional points.
Firstly, we want Parliament to recall that, last June, the Justice and Home Affairs Council requested Member States to step up cooperation in order to prevent and control violence and disturbances in connection with international football matches.
At the same time a handbook was made available with examples of working methods to police forces.
Secondly, the Community' s programme for police and customs cooperation finances a project prepared between the police authorities of the Netherlands and Belgium in which police forces from other Member States participate.
This aims at drawing lessons from the organisation of Euro 2000 in order to improve, when necessary, the organisations of future similar events.
I would just like to add one point.
I very much hope that Euro 2000 is a great success.
However, I hope with equal fervour that the games during Euro 2000 are a great deal better than the one I watched on television last night.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 6 p.m.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I will be very brief but I rise on a matter which is dear to the hearts of most Members here.
On a number of occasions this week the Members bar has had in it visitors from outside Parliament and, actually, just members of the public.
I know a number of Members during the week have been unable to get any food.
Could we have some clarification from the Quaestors so that we can have a Members bar?
We have a Members bar in Brussels.
I am not against taking one or two members of staff or whoever it might be into the bar, but to bring visiting groups of 20 or more into it is wrong.
I hope we can have some clarification.
Thank you, Mr Sturdy.
We will refer that to the College of Quaestors, as you requested.
Mr President, I understand that we are to vote on the last two resolutions, concerning Guatemala and the non-proliferation agreement, without a debate.
I am not going to object to that, but I would note the anomaly in Parliament being able to devote half an hour' s discussion to football hooliganism - and I am nonetheless a great football enthusiast - but not having a spare minute to discuss the biggest form of hooliganism we have, namely the presence of nuclear weapons in the world.
Your point is well made. The decision was taken this morning that we would vote at 6 p.m. and that the urgencies not reached would be voted on even though they were not debated.
The matter of football hooliganism was under the human rights matters.
That debate has been concluded.
So we have finished that whole section.
I do not want lots of debates.
We have a lot of voting to get through tonight.
Mr President, I quite understand that you want to avoid a long debate now, but I do not think it was clear when we decided on this this morning that the urgencieswould simply go by the board.
If that had been the case, some Members might have voted differently.
This House should certainly not get into the habit of letting subjects which have been on the agenda since the beginning of the week go by the board.
We were going to discuss Guatemala.
MPs from Guatemala have been with us the whole week, and we are trying to convince them to improve their democracy and their respect for human rights.
I do not think we will be setting a very good example if we then fail to even discuss this issue!
I would just point out to you Rule 50, paragraph 6: "The President and political group chairmen may decide that that the motion for a resolution shall be put to the vote without debate" .
That was the rule under which this practice has been established.
I agree with you that it should not become a precedent.
Let us move forward now to the vote.
Mr President, I rise to make a point about the vote: it would be quite possible to challenge this vote either because of non-observance of the 24-hour deadline, or, possibly, because of the quorum position.
I do not want to do this, but I would like to ask Mrs Buitenweg and her friends to call a truce tomorrow and to refrain from their sabotage tactics in this House!
Mr President, I rise to make a point of order along exactly the same lines as my fellow Member. I regret that Mrs Buitenweg has involved herself in sabotage tactics and I would like to respond to the repeated claims we have heard from Mrs Buitenweg, Mrs Van Lancker and Mr Howitt, who are accusing others of sabotage, when, in fact, it has been Mrs Buitenweg herself who has been at the forefront of the action to sabotage the functioning of this Chamber.
Mr President, on a point of order.
I should like to move that we proceed to a vote straight away.
We had the debate on this this morning, we made our decision, let us just get on with it.
Vote
Mr President, people are different, yet of equal value.
In our opinion, human society should be based on solidarity, human dignity and equality.
Everyone is entitled to this.
Unfortunately, there is a long tradition of unequal treatment, first and foremost by people who have the power to make other people dependent on them.
They can treat those who are dependent on them unequally by rewarding or punishing them for features which are out of their control.
This was not only done by slave owners and colonial military, but has also been the tactic of employers and those with political authority.
There is also discrimination if the basic requirements of people are made unnecessarily scarce.
If everyone has to fight for a job, a place in education or house, a battle of interests will ensue.
People then start to think along the lines of: if the others were not here, there would be more for us.
From a racist angle, the question then simply is: who can have those scarce provisions and who cannot?
Anyone belonging to a different group can be seen as an unwanted competitor on the job or housing market.
In Western Europe, employers and the police are still ruled by prejudice and a tendency to treat people unequally.
In addition, there are groups who seek political gain from scarcity and short-sightedness by setting people against each other.
The fact that in the recently formed new states of Eastern Europe, the language of workers and farmers has become the language of the state and education, forms part of the necessary democratisation process but should not go hand in hand with discriminating against, and even driving out, minorities living within the particular state' s territory.
Everyone is entitled to protection from those seeking political and economic gain from discrimination.
Vital tools for achieving this are suffrage for newcomers, humane treatment of political refugees, equal treatment of all residents of the European Union, irrespective of their nationality, and the reversal of the burden of proof in legal cases.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has opted in favour of maximum reinforcement of the position of the victims of discrimination and against all attempts to prejudice this protection.
Mr President, I voted for the proposal for the race directive.
I did so very willingly and, particularly in my capacity as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I am glad to have been able to use my vote to contribute to the adoption of this directive.
Today' s pensioners and elderly people lived through the Second World War: they know what racism means.
They hoped that the issue would never have to be raised again, let alone regulated by laws banning racist acts.
I hope that this law will soon be out of date, for that will mean that antiracist behaviour has ceased. I hope that this and every other law against discrimination will become obsolete.
Since, sadly, this is not the case at present, Europe is acting wisely in publicly making its position so clear.

The Commission' s proposal for a directive on implementing in Europe the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin clearly shows that it is better to let well alone. This is even truer with regard to the Buitenweg report to the European Parliament.
The proposal initially seemed to be well intentioned as it aimed to improve protection for victims of racism in the European Union.
In reality, however, the text before us is so obsessed with hunting down discrimination that it completely loses sight of the basic principles of the rule of law and even, to crown it all, the principle of equal treatment between persons.
In addition, the proposal for a directive as usual fails to respect subsidiarity and allow the Member States the necessary room for assessment.
On the issue of the rule of law, it is particularly astonishing to read in Article 8 of the Commission' s text that if, in a given situation, a case of discrimination is assumed, it is the defendant' s responsibility to prove that there has been no violation of the principle of equal treatment.
This flouts the traditional principle of our law which states that it is the responsibility of the accuser to provide proof of the culpability of the accused and not the responsibility of the accused to provide proof of his innocence.
The effect of such a provision would be all the more devastating as the assumed discrimination could be 'indirect discrimination' which occurs, according to Article 2(2)(b), 'where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice is liable to affect adversely a person or a group of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin' .
However, this dedication to anti-discrimination soon comes to a halt in the Commission' s text as Article 5 states that specific measures may be adopted to compensate for the handicaps of a supposedly disadvantaged ethnic group.
This sows the seed for the famous American policy of 'positive discrimination' which is nowadays much disputed, even in the USA.
And this is just the Commission' s text which is the most moderate.
The European Parliament report adds to this in all respects.
Some people in the Commission seem to be having doubts as they have taken the trouble to add a form to the proposal for a directive which explains the possible impact of the directive on enterprises.
This unusual procedure clearly shows that the issue is not cut and dried.
In this form, the Commission simply states that "the Directive will strengthen the competitiveness of European companies by ensuring that they have at their disposal a wider pool of skills and resources than at present and that use is made of such skills irrespective of racial or ethnic origin" .
Unfortunately, this statement, which is solely intended to give the authors a clear conscience, is completely false.
It is quite clear that employers risk being plagued, particularly in the area of recruitment, with threats from people whose applications have been rejected.
Yet it cannot be denied that the immigrants currently entering the European countries are mainly unskilled and come from countries where work experience in businesses such as ours is very scarce.
Threatened by this new legislation and in order to keep the peace, employers may be forced to employ people without any real justification which will hinder the competitiveness of their companies.
For all these reasons, we reject the Buitenweg report. We hope that the Council, which must act unanimously pursuant to Article 13 of the EC Treaty, will in turn reject the Commission proposal.
I was going to vote in favour of the motion given its positive points and the hopes to which certain points may legitimately give rise.
However, two interventions by Mr DÃ©sir highlighted that the texts, at least in the French version, contained provisions totally contrary to the principles of international law and, in particular, to the European Convention on Human Rights.
This is why I abstained during the vote on the legislative resolution.
We have voted for the Buitenweg report which supports and improves, in several respects, the proposal for a Council directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin.
However, as we said during the vote on Amendment No 39, we totally disagree with the wording of Article 4 of the draft directive. By providing that "a difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to racial or ethnic origin shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine occupational qualification" , this totally contradicts the provisions of the international and European conventions on human rights and the elimination of all forms of social discrimination.
It should be noted that these conventions are binding on the European Union and the Member States which have ratified them.
This wording also contradicts the laws and constitutions of several EU Member States.
This article cannot be transposed into French law, for example, as the Constitutional Council would rightly be forced to oppose this.
If retained in the final version of the directive, this article would, for the first time, constitute a legal basis for discrimination in the right to work based on 'a characteristic related to racial or ethnic origin' .
We were anxious to accompany our vote with this reservation which also applies to the totally inappropriate use in several articles, in the French version at least, of the word 'race' .
In Article 2, for example, it is used to describe 'a group of persons' and not as a characteristic of unacceptable discrimination. This therefore seems to justify this concept and allows it to be validly and properly used to describe a person or group.
The fight against racism is clearly based precisely on the rejection of the concept of race, on its denunciation and on the refusal to place men and women in this category and to divide humanity according to this concept.
- I am voting in favour of the Race Directive for the following reasons.
As a British Asian woman, I have experienced first-hand the damaging effects racism can have on people and communities.
Although there have been tremendous strides over the last few years to fight racism in all its forms, it still continues to blight people' s lives.
For example, in my own region, the West Midlands, we have recently seen some worrying instances of racist violence.
The attack on the white partner of the world-class black athlete Ashia Hansen is a sickening example.
This report is a real breakthrough in reversing the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases.
Once the facts of the case are established, it will fall to those accused of racism to prove their innocence.
I particularly welcome the measures included in the directive which will allow individuals to take civil proceedings if they are victimised on the grounds of race.
I am also glad that the legislation takes account of the notion of "indirect discrimination" , where apparently neutral provisions can have an adverse effect on a person or a group of a particular race or ethnic origin.
Right-wing extremism is increasing, not just in Austria, but throughout Europe.
This directive provides some of the most effective anti-racism legislation that Europe has ever seen, and the most effective piece of race relations legislation to affect my own Member State since the 1976 Race Relations Act.
Minority groups must be given a greater stake in Europe.
The EU should pay more attention to their problems and aspirations.
We need to connect EU institutions to all the communities of the Union.
Europe must be inclusive, not exclusive.
We must tackle racism wherever and whenever it occurs.
The race directive is a stand against racism and a major step towards stamping it out.
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the report by Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg on the Council' s directive for implementing the principle of equal treatment for all, irrespective of race or ethnic origin.
We were delighted to do so, because the European Parliament is hereby complying with its task in connection with implementing Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
According to Article 13 of the Treaty, the European Parliament is merely to be heard on this matter.
In our voting, it has therefore been important that Parliament' s opinion - both the individual points and the opinion as a whole - should have very broad political backing.
We have nonetheless been unable to vote in favour of those amendments directly affecting matters which come within the sphere of the Member States' criminal law.
These matters continue to be national concerns.
In connection with the debate on the report, we have pointed out that the present directive only deals with discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin.
But what about all the other protective considerations listed in Article 13 of the Treaty?
We are concerned that, by only proceeding on the basis of these two considerations in the present directive, the EU will, in practice, create a hierarchy of possible grounds for discrimination.
We would therefore especially draw attention to Amendment No 6 concerning a new consideration which is absolutely crucial for ourselves.
- Given the worrying evidence that racism is on the rise I warmly welcome this report which aims to ensure equal treatment in the employment and social sector between persons of all ethnic backgrounds.
The rapporteur seeks to ensure a common minimum level of protection including the reversal of the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases and giving individuals the right to take civil proceedings if they are harassed or victimised on the grounds of race.
The Portuguese Presidency is to be congratulated for their readiness to put this matter on the Council' s agenda.
The fight against discrimination is an issue which has been on the agenda of the French Assembly since 1979. Two inquiries on racism have already been established and the French Parliament was the instigator in 1986 of a joint interinstitutional declaration.
However, such initiatives are no longer enough.
We must go further and legislate.
The Buitenweg report is timely as racism and anti-Semitism are still of concern in Europe.
Is this the right moment to reiterate our vigilance with regard to certain parties now in power?
With Mr Deprez and Mr De Clercq I tabled an amendment to the title of the directive.
In the French version the Commission' s initial text uses the phrase 'sans distinction de race ou d' origine ethnique' .
The concept of origin is fundamental as discrimination may relate not only to the current status of an individual but also to his origin and descent.
We wanted to introduce the same nuance and precision with regard to the issue of race and therefore proposed 'd' origine raciale' .
This amendment was adopted in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights but I note now that it has simply disappeared from the text submitted to you.
We should like an assurance that this will be duly corrected.
Also, although the issue of religion has been excluded from this directive for legal reasons, it is vital to reiterate that we are definitely not ignoring the forms of discrimination based on religious beliefs. Parliament has still to examine another Commission text in this respect.
To conclude, the Buitenweg report is inspired by a proactive and progressive approach which I have supported.
The risk of a resurgence of the neo-fascist and racist hydra requires close vigilance from us, more so now than ever before.
We must lead the way in this fight.
That concludes the vote.
Trafficking in women (continuation)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on trafficking in women.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the magnificent work she has carried out on such a serious problem.
The trafficking in women is having a very great impact, especially in the border countries of the European Union, where mafias are forming which deceive women with promises of employment and a better life, and which lead them eventually into prostitution and, in many cases, into situations which can only be described as slavery.
This is a phenomenon related to our current society, in which immigration is beginning to cause a serious problem, since we are seeing significant movements of people who are seeking the kind of welfare society which we enjoy in the majority, or practically all, of the European Union countries.
This situation requires a series of new measures, most importantly aiding victims and prosecuting the people involved in the trafficking in women and children - since it is not just a problem for women, but children as well - for sexual exploitation.
Amongst the measures proposed in this report are basically aid to victims and the request that Member States amend their legislation in a way which will allow quicker and more coordinated action amongst the various countries in order to resolve this very serious problem.
The victims do not only require material aid, but also legal assistance - because we are generally talking about people with no documentation, with no options and who are living in fear and need help - which, at the same time, protects their identity and guarantees that they will not suffer even worse problems if they return to their countries of origin.
The different countries of the European Union must harmonise their legislation in this respect and implement sufficient measures to help these victims.
The trade in sex is increasing at an alarming rate.
Women and children are involved.
I believe that the media should also aid this process, because we are seeing more and more adverts in the press - sometimes in the very serious newspapers - behind which lies the trafficking in women and exploitation.
However, it is not only through legal assistance and through protecting the victims that we must address the problem, but also through information campaigns, mainly in the countries of origin, so that these women know what they are really exposing themselves to, since the majority of them are being deceived and do not realise the hell they are about to walk into.
Mr President, every year, half a million women are tricked or forced into lives as sex slaves.
This greatly increasing trade is more profitable than drug smuggling and is increasingly being directed by an organised mafia for trafficking in women.
Despite this grim reality, the penalty for trafficking in women is exceedingly small compared with that for serious drug smuggling.
It amounts to perhaps two years' imprisonment compared with ten to fifteen years for serious drug-related offences.
Few offenders are brought to court, and still fewer prosecuted.
The EU has so far exemplified the fact that words are not always translated into reality.
Despite a number of statements from the EU about the appalling traffic in women, there is still no complete database with information about victims, trade routes, legislation or measures to be taken.
The European women' s lobby reports that only 0.036 per cent of the EU' s budget for the year 2000 has been set aside for issues of equality and that only a fraction of this fraction goes on measures to combat trafficking in women.
A growing number of women are being smuggled in from the candidate States.
In spite of this, the EU has not made demands upon these countries to prevent, and to introduce measures against, trafficking in women, similar to the demands that have been made regarding economic and environmental objectives to be attained by the candidate States.
By not complying with existing laws and not creating new laws to tackle the mafia concerned, the governments of Europe are indirectly allowing this demand-driven trade to increase.
There is a lack of legislation, not only in terms of measures to combat the aforesaid mafia, but also in terms of laws to protect the victims.
All but two Member States send victims of the trafficking in women back to their countries of origin, in spite of the possibility that their lives may be in danger.
We are voting today, or hopefully tomorrow, on an attempt to convert rhetoric and fine words into concrete measures.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is demanding that the Member States provide women who give evidence with protection and refugee status.
We demand tough, exemplary penalties for trafficking in women, together with national informants on trafficking in women, able to inform their governments about developments in their own countries, as well as in other countries.
We demand measures to combat the increasing use of the Internet for the purpose of trafficking in women, and we demand that national police forces and embassy officials be given appropriate training and that increased resources be made available for the voluntary organisations which provide aid to victims.
Before the end of this year, the governments of the Member States will presumably have decided upon a new Treaty.
We assume that this Treaty will contain a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women, including, of course, trafficking in women, and that we shall be devising a common European policy for combating the trade in human beings.
Among the issues which should be covered by this policy is that of immigration and asylum, especially that of the right to asylum on the grounds of sexually motivated oppression and sexually motivated persecution.
In the United States and Russia, slavery was abolished in the 1860s. It has to be said, however, that the incidence of slavery is increasing, despite the fact that we have now entered the twenty-first century.
This new form of slavery mainly affects women and girls but, irrespective of who is being enslaved, the mere presence of slavery is humanity' s best evidence of poverty.
Many now support the demand to put a stop to the female slave trade, but more is needed in terms of manpower, intervention by governments and concrete action.
Mr President, it is quite incredible to stand in this Chamber - I can hardly call it an Assembly right now - and realise that we, in fact, have an on-going slave trade in the European Union, too - here, where we commend ourselves for creating peace, freedom, democracy and human rights.
It is a serious matter that we should have this type of trade, because it is often not even adult women who are affected but near-children and very, very young people.
This trade is very closely linked to drugs and money laundering. Presumably, it is different types of mafia which control it.
This report is very good.
Like the previous speaker, I want to emphasise that we need to see action taken and that police cooperation needs to be developed and more information made available.
I am often sceptical about the very large demands, for example with regard to the environment, which are being made of the candidate States.
At the same time, I think it would be reasonable to demand that information be provided to the countries' own citizens, with other information being directed specially at young women.
This measure would not, in fact, require large resources, and it is entirely feasible to implement it.
I can therefore only appeal to everyone to vote in favour of the report and to go home and work on their own governments, organisations and the media, too.
Mr President, prevention is better than cure.
This seems to be an impossible task in the case of trafficking in women.
Within EU territory and especially in the Central and Eastern European countries, the commercial exploitation of women is flourishing.
In the rapporteur' s report, it appears that the measures taken so far have been to little avail.
If we really want to prevent trafficking in women, we will need to adopt a different approach.
We cannot put a stop to this trade by amending immigration and asylum policy and the legalisation of prostitution.
And although I am generally in favour of good working conditions, these too cannot halt the trafficking in women.
After all, as long as the demand for prostitutes is still there, there will always be women who, enticed by better prospects presented to them, will - often unwittingly - make themselves available as merchandise.
It is not only heartless criminal organisations, but also rich, and not so rich, customers who help perpetuate the slave labour of these women who have no other prospects.
We cannot bridge this chasm between rich and poor with a few initiatives organised at Community level.
In addition to a sound and generous development policy in order to improve the living conditions of women in our own countries, it is necessary to question the lack of moral standards within our society.
By imposing heavy penalties on criminal organisations which indulge in trafficking in people, we clearly denounce this type of practice.
Only in this way can trafficking in women be effectively pushed back.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her very valuable report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1996, we more or less got the political go-ahead to tackle trafficking in women at European level, and I am delighted to tell you that the then Belgian government played a vital role in bringing about this green light.
But I think we need to ask ourselves whether, after four years of work, Europe is sufficiently equipped to be able to fight this trafficking in women effectively.
I think I can assume that the SÃ¶rensen report makes it abundantly clear that this is not the case.
We back Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s report 100% and I would like to congratulate her on her sterling work.
I would especially like to re-emphasise the fact that the resolutions, which we will be approving tomorrow, fail to display a coherent legal framework for tackling trafficking in women, an issue which, in fact, the Belgian government made a point of hammering home at the time.
I think that everyone by now realises that a coherent approach to trafficking in people first and foremost presupposes a clear definition of trafficking in women, which, indeed, is not restricted to forced prostitution, although this is very important, but encompasses all types of trafficking in women and which is linked to deterrent sanctions involving trafficking in people.
I think it is beyond dispute that the national laws and methods for tracing victims and prosecuting offenders within the world of trafficking in women should be harmonised as a matter of urgency and that it is important that police forces work together more effectively.
A second point which is essential to us in this report - and we have been hammering on about this for a while now - is the fact that we need to continue to be committed to the protection of women who are the victims of such types of trafficking.
All too often in many countries, those women are criminalised whereas, in fact, they are the victims.
What we are advocating is a legal residence status for those women so that they can be protected.
Thirdly, I think it is clear that without such a legal framework, we will never reach a solution to this problem.
In fact, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino at this stage on his intention to present a framework decision to the Council within the course of this year, as a result of which we would then be able to resolve a number of these bottlenecks and issues.
Patsy SÃ¶rensen, our rapporteur, knows the topic of her report like the back of her hand.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner, since he is here, when drafting his future policy on trafficking in people, to talk to police forces and the civil service - this goes without saying - but I would very much urge him to make ample time for workers at base and aid workers in the field.
After all, it is also their expertise which can ensure that our approach to trafficking in women is coherent and all-encompassing.
Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen for her report, which contains many proposals, and for the emphasis placed on the fact that trafficking in women and children is a violation of human rights.
The body and the human person are not commodities.
Even though many women choose to become prostitutes as an easy way of making a living, I would make no distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution: all prostitution is exploitation.
I would like to stress three points: firstly, trafficking and immigration.
A closed border policy prompts immigrants to turn to criminal organisations in order to procure visas or enter the country concerned illegally.
The Member States must develop a more united, responsible policy.
Thirdly: the victims' rights.
It was proposed that the European Union issue temporary residence permits to victims which would be conditional upon the victims giving evidence against the traffickers, but, as yet, Italy is the only State to issue permits which are not conditional upon the giving of evidence.
I would like to finish by raising the question of clients.
Commissioner Vitorino repeatedly stated the need to take into account the demand of this market, that is the clients.
But who are the clients?
They could be our fathers, our sons or ourselves.
It is our duty to do our part to bring about a radical change in the mentality and culture of our society.
This means promoting policies which support women.
Mr President, if we are to discuss trafficking in women, we have to be aware that we are talking about a form of slavery, a modern form of slavery in which the majority of the victims are women subjected to trafficking run by organised crime networks.
Trafficking in human beings supplies various markets: the market in organs for medical transplants, the market in new-born babies for those who do not have any children and the sweatshop market.
However, the greatest area of crime involves women, the majority of whom are victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.
The poverty and marginalisation of the women in their countries of origin, the high earnings guaranteed to traffickers and the low risks they incur, and the substantial demand for women for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation are the factors behind the growth of this trade.
The Tampere European Council recently charged the European Union to fight against illegal immigration and, amongst other things, against those who profit from the trafficking in human beings.
Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s report goes beyond this perspective and gives absolute priority to the fight against trafficking in human beings.
It is estimated that 500 000 women are trafficked every year, the majority of whom then work illegally, but the underground nature of the trade means that the true extent of the problem is unknown.
The contribution of non-governmental organisations in revealing the causes, methods and consequences of the trafficking in women for sexual exploitation, and the support they provide for the victims, has brought about greater awareness of these issues.
The STOP and DAPHNE programmes already represent a major contribution of the European Union, but we must not stop there.
Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s excellent report stresses the links between the trafficking in human beings and the policy on immigration and asylum, and calls, in the first place, upon the Intergovernmental Conference to bring about integral communitarisation of European policy in this field.
As the report requests, it will therefore be necessary to establish a legal framework and effective prevention, protection and victim support measures at European level.
On the other hand, the Member States and candidate countries must intervene themselves at legislative, administrative and police levels in order to eliminate this crime and, at the same time, increase international cooperation with Europol and Interpol to fight criminal networks.
At national level, refugee status must be granted to the victims of trafficking and they must be issued with residence permits.
Some countries - Italy and Belgium - assisted by NGOs, have already introduced some early measures.
Furthermore, information campaigns must be launched in the victims' countries of origin and an awareness action pursued in the Member States to raise public awareness, in particular, among the male population.
- (EL) Mr President, with millions of people victim to the criminal activities of worldwide international trafficking gangs throughout the world and the terrifying spread of these networks to the European Union, we urgently need to take steps to fight this contemporary Lernaean Hydra.
The Union and the Member States currently have no powers whatsoever to intervene efficiently and break up the gangs operating almost undisturbed in our midst and in our neighbourhoods.
The public in Athens was shocked recently at the revelation that an Albanian immigrant, who had declared that he was a doctor, had kept a 13-year-old girl imprisoned in his apartment in a peaceful neighbourhood of Athens for nine months and prostituted her to some 50-60 respectable customers a day.
I personally advocate therefore that all the strategies used to fight trafficking in and the sexual exploitation of women and children should call for harsh punishment, both for those who profit from the trade in human beings and for those who use the services of prostitutes, as is the case under Swedish and Canadian law.
It would appear that the increase in human trafficking has coincided with the recent mass migration of people and the impoverishment of large sections of society.
Le Monde recently published shocking information on the activities of human traffickers, who are taking advantage of the situation in Kosovo and working with international illegal immigration organisations in order to sexually exploit some 300 000 women in France, Germany and Belgium, women mainly from Kosovo, but also from Moldavia, Romania and Bosnia.
Women are being held in concentration camps in conditions of true slavery and are being tortured before being forced into prostitution.
What is happening is a disgrace to Europe in the 21st century and betrays a lack of political will and commitment to prioritise this issue.
The Commission communication is satisfactory and Mrs SÃ¶rensen has presented an excellent report, but good intentions alone will not combat international organised crime.
We need initiatives on several fronts: legislative and administrative measures, harmonisation of legislation and prosecution methods, harsh punishment, protection for victims and collaboration between police and judicial authorities.
We also need to strengthen Europol with more funds and more staff so that it can start making joint prevention and prosecution plans with all the Member States and, of course, we need to strengthen non-governmental organisations.
In other words, we need to implement all the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions immediately. All these are issues, Commissioner, on which we are making no progress whatsoever.
Mr President and honourable Members of Parliament, the Commission welcomes the opportunity of participating in this debate on how to develop our common efforts in the fight against trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation following the Commission' s second communication of December 1998.
I take the opportunity of paying my respects to my predecessor, Mrs Gradin, who was the author of that communication.
May I extend my congratulations to the honourable Member, Mrs SÃ¶rensen.
Her report is a very valuable contribution towards continuing our work.
Before going into the more substantial parts of this subject, I would like to state that the Commission remains fully committed to keeping the fight against this degrading form of violation of human rights and human dignity high on the political agenda.
We have proved that in the proposals that we put to the European Council of Tampere last October.
As several Members have already emphasised, preventive and repressive measures, as well as measures to support the victims, together with international cooperation, must be given further encouragement.
I noted that the resolution that you are going to vote on tomorrow and the report that we are discussing today contain a large number of requests to the Commission.
I will therefore try to address a few of these key issues.
I wish first of all to address the matter of improving existing penal law in the Member States as regards the criminalisation of traffickers of human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
As a starting point in this exercise, we have here the February 1997 instrument, but it has become quite clear that it has its shortcomings.
As I understand, during the hearing in August, the Commission will present at the end of this semester a package of proposals on trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and children.
We have, in my opinion, a firm basis for this in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Vienna Action Plan of 1998 and the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere.
Therefore, we do not need to wait for any change in the Treaties: we have a clear legal basis to address this issue of making trafficking in women a criminal offence.
Mrs Van Lancker said the proposal is based on a Council framework decision which will look in particular at how to ensure that all Member States have common definitions, common criminal offences and common sanctions.
In addition, we need to consider in the drafting exercise horizontal judicial issues such as defining the competent jurisdiction, the rules on extradition and seizure of the proceeds of crime.
One important aspect for the future is that when finally adopted, this proposal will form a part of the acquis communautaire.
This means that the candidate countries will have to take it on board in the context of enlargement.
Another important element closely related to improving efficiency in the conviction of traffickers is, as I have already mentioned to Parliament, granting temporary residence permits to victims of trafficking who are willing to give evidence.
This was one of the Commission' s suggestions in its second communication.
The package of proposals that I mentioned before will, therefore, be completed a bit later this year with a proposal for a directive that will cover the issue of temporary residence permits so as to ensure the protection of various victims of trafficking including the victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
This element must, however, be seen as a crucial complement to the first set of initiatives.
As a matter of fact, there is a real difficulty in convicting those who are responsible for trafficking.
Without the cooperation of the victims, we can never make sure that those who profit from this traffic are brought before a court and are duly convicted.
It is extremely important to couple these two kinds of measures: criminalisation of trafficking and, at the same time, having a proactive policy on promoting the cooperation of the victims with the police and with the judiciary in convicting those who are responsible for such degrading activity.
Talking about significant developments in the field of trafficking in women at European level, we also need to take a look at the various activities that are, and have been, supported by the STOP programme.
Previous and future projects under the STOP programme cover several points that are highlighted in Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s report.
In particular, I would like to mention two of the priorities set for this year, namely, assistance to victims and prevention.
In applying a multidisciplinary approach, this will involve NGOs as well as law enforcement services and I believe that it is necessary to promote closer dialogue between the NGOs that act in this area and the law enforcement authorities.
As the STOP Programme is now in its last financial year and has made a valuable contribution to the fight against trafficking at European level, the Commission will put forward a proposal for a renewal of the programme for another five-year period starting in 2001.
The proposal will, of course, build on experience gained from the first programme.
We also intend to offer the possibility of running multiannual projects which will improve the efficiency of the programmes.
A word also needs to be said about implementation of the new DAPHNE Programme following the DAPHNE initiative adopted in 1997.
Its scope, as you know, is to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women and children. This includes trafficking in women and the sexual exploitation of women.
The programme will allow us, in addition to the STOP programme, to help victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation by providing a financial contribution of EUR 20 million in the period from 2000 to 2003.
In addition, more focus has been given and needs to be given to developing our cooperation through specific projects with the candidate countries such as several Members have mentioned of Parliament.
We share with these candidate countries a serious common problem, since there is a clear trend involving the Central and Eastern European countries as the most important region of origin of both victims of trafficking and perpetrators.
The Commission has, therefore, opened DAPHNE to the candidate countries and will do the same under the STOP Programme.
Finally, the Commission has also mobilised other sources of financing to promote both support to local NGOs in the candidate countries and prevention campaigns in countries of origin.
In the framework of the new Transatlantic Agenda and in cooperation with the government of the United States of America, it has, for instance, carried out various information campaigns in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary and Bulgaria, to raise an awareness within the population and the public bodies of these countries.
For the future we are exploring the possibility of new campaigns targeting new areas and new countries.
This is an issue that has a relevant role to play in the Stability Pact for the Balkans.
Last but not least, I wish to clearly underline the importance of the Union being involved in wider forms of international cooperation.
The Commission is now actively participating in the work on the draft United Nations protocol on trafficking to supplement the draft convention on trans-national organised crime and I sincerely hope that the members of the United Nations will be able to adopt this new convention in autumn this year.
In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to a point that we need to keep in mind when working against trafficking in women at European level. That point is that even though the European Union can, and must, play an active role against trafficking, the Member States have the prime responsibility.
This means that we need to be careful when talking about measures such as automatic non-criminalisation of victims of trafficking, possibilities of NGOs bringing court action on behalf of the victims and investigative methods in criminal matters.
In other words, we need to be clear about which objectives can be better achieved at European level taking into account the level of cross-border cooperation in place among the Member States.
Honourable Members have an opportunity of adapting what I consider a piece of good work that not only confirms a coherent and multidisciplinary European policy on trafficking but also adds new impetus for further actions which are undoubtedly necessary at European level.
I want to thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen for her knowledge, her expertise and her contribution to this common fight.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Readmission of third country nationals
The next item is the report (A5-0110/2000) by Ms Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Initiative of the Republic of Finland with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation determining obligations as between Member States for the readmission of third country nationals (12488/1999 - C5-0319/1999 - 1999/0823(CNS)).
Mr President, my report does indeed concern the proposal for a regulation submitted by the Finnish Presidency on the relations and obligations as between the Member States for the readmission of third country nationals inside the European Union.
I am really sorry to have to say, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, that the proposal for a regulation has not been given the due attention, study and careful preparation needed when handling such a delicate and complicated matter.
This lack of preparation has resulted in serious reservations, rejection or a lack of interest in the proposal for a directive by the European Commission and the Council and by the parliamentary committees responsible, i.e. the Committee on Freedoms and the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as on the part of non-governmental organisations, which the Finnish Presidency does not appear to have consulted.
The Tampere conclusions noted that the Union needed a comprehensive approach to the phenomenon of immigration, which is clearly linked to a whole series of political questions which have remained unanswered.
It is linked to respect for human rights and to the economic, social, political and cultural conditions in the person' s country of origin.
As far as the question of readmission is concerned, the Member States already have the experience of agreements under European Political Collaboration and Schengen-type cooperation.
This is a sensitive issue which calls for diplomatic collaboration.
As far as the content of the Finnish initiative is concerned, there is no explanatory statement attached to the draft regulation.
The initiative does not show any strategic vision.
The draft seeks to lay down a Dublin-style system for illegal immigrants, following the model of the Convention on asylum seekers, the application of which, as we know, has proven to be highly problematic and ineffective.
Priority is given in the proposal for a regulation to send back foreigners illegally present on the territory of Member States under a system of compulsory readmission operating between Member States.
The regulation aims to determine which Member State is obliged to readmit a third country national in order to implement the agreement in question.
The draft regulation does not debar a Member State from sending a foreigner who does not meet the conditions of entry or residence in a Member State back to his or her country of origin or another third country.
This provision seems to empower Member States to take more severe decisions outside the scope of the proposed regulation.
Other points which deserve criticism are the fact that any kind of solidarity between Member States is precluded, in particular as far as illegal border crossings and responsibility for the external borders of the European Union are concerned.
The proposal is perhaps a way of exercising indirect pressure for the borders of the European Union to be fortified.
Similarly, absolutely no consideration is given to the particular circumstances of persons who may have spent a long period of time in a Member State before being classed as illegal.
Residence permits for asylum seekers are not included in the documents provided for in the regulation, thereby creating the possibility of undermining the protection afforded to them.
The regulation permits readmission to another Member State to be requested within six months from the time when the authorities of the requesting Member State became aware that a third country national may be (not "is" ) illegally present.
In other words, the proposal allows entry to the territory of a Member State to be proven on the basis of hypothetical evidence.
The way in which the data required to identify persons to be readmitted is determined is open to every kind of abuse.
However, the basic problem appears to be that no strategy or European policy has been devised on immigration.
I consider, Commissioner, that we urgently need to prepare legal tools for the immigration directive, rather than confining ourselves to suppression and policing measures which are not subject to democratic control.
We urgently need to implement the Tampere conclusions and devise a common European policy on asylum and immigration based on European humanitarian values and respect for fundamental human rights.
Finally, we call on the European Commission to take the necessary legislative initiatives on all the issues which touch on immigration and, of course, to define the mutual obligations as between the Member States.
We are aware, Commissioner, of your personal interest and of the difficulties facing the Council and assure you that any initiatives which you may table in this direction will have our undivided support.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Karamanou for cooperating in such a straightforward and excellent way.
I know that we all had to work very quickly on this document, and at that time she was under additional pressure because of commitments at national level.
She has already mentioned very many points, and I would just like to say that, as regards content, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was in agreement, as it was with the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
We only differed on a formal detail.
On behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, we are also requesting that this Initiative of the Republic of Finland should be withdrawn.
I am certain that it was very well intended, but it has not been thought through sufficiently.
Legally speaking, it has thrown up more questions than it has supplied explanations.
I would like to add a few important points.
An initiative of this kind should not mean that people can just be shipped back and forth within our territory.
Furthermore, as Mrs Karamanou has just said, this represents a programme singularly lacking in solidarity between the Member States.
With regard to readmission agreements, they should not be used as a possible way of twisting the arms of countries in receipt of development aid by saying that they will only receive development aid and funds or cooperation if they also sign readmission agreements.
This is bordering on blackmail.
Last but not least, I would like to say that the readmission of persons illegally residing in our territory is another problem that can only be solved jointly, by working together to fight the root causes and to finally address the issues of integration and asylum in cooperation.
Mr President, allow me to begin by highlighting the work of both the rapporteur and Mrs Echerer, the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I have had the opportunity to work with the rapporteur in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and it has been an honour for me to chair the committee that voted for Mrs Echerer' s excellent opinion.
Mr President, we are facing a situation which is real problem: the progressive disappearance of internal borders means that non-EU citizens in both legal and illegal situations are moving freely amongst the Member States.
If we are going to be realistic, this is a problem which, as the two rapporteurs have stressed, we must deal with fully, and, I might add, as a matter of urgency.
My view of the Finnish initiative is much less critical than theirs.
I believe we should stress the fact that the Finnish initiative was a very significant step forward from the moment it was put on the table, because it led the Council to get involved in a very urgent issue.
In other words, at the time, the Finnish initiative played a fundamental role, and we might say that it has died as a result of its own success.
The thinking behind the Finnish initiative means that its proposals no longer have any point, because they have now been fully adopted.
What we need now is not a provocative initiative which points its finger at the problem and starts a debate, but rather we need to get down - calmly but immediately - to resolving this problem.
Apart from that, I agree with many of the criticisms that have been made.
I also agree with one which has been made implicitly but which has not been stated directly.
We, as a legislating institution, cannot amend just any text; there are texts which are not amendable and texts which require a complete amendment.
This is what we have done in the case of the Finnish initiative, at least in the PPE Group.
We welcome the courage of the Finnish initiative, but we believe that this initiative will not seriously enable us to carry out the responsibilities that the European public has entrusted to us.
Why not?
For the reasons which have been expressed, and which I would probably just be repeating: this initiative takes account of one aspect, the most repressive one, but that is only one aspect of the problem.
What we need now, given the developments since Tampere, is a more global vision.
The rapporteur is absolutely right to point out that this initiative does not take account of questions of procedure, or fundamental guarantees for the procedure, nor does it provide the necessary protection for the fundamental rights of those people who will be caught up in this type of procedure.
Finally, it has not been pointed out - and I think it is important that it is - that what we do in this area must be coherent with the Member States' principles regarding readmission of third country nationals.
All these types of bilateral agreement that are required are being negotiated.
The PPE has presented two amendments which I hope this House - to take up what the two previous speakers have said - will support in tomorrow' s vote, thereby sending a political signal, and we ask the Commission to present a complete and coherent text sooner rather than later.
Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson for their report and opinion.
I would also like to say on behalf of my Group that we fully support the proposal to refer this initiative back.
We did not come to this conclusion because we wanted to make things easy for ourselves and not table any amendments, but because - as emerges from the explanatory statement, which is very comprehensive and convincing - too many fundamental requirements have simply not been met.
We have heard about these shortcomings in the debate as well as reading about them in the reports.
However, it is not because of these shortcomings that we are recommending that this specific initiative should be rejected. What is at stake here is whether it makes sense for the Member States to have the right of initiative in these areas of competence.
The proposals on which Parliament has been consulted up to now under this right of initiative have not, on the whole, been very convincing - including an Austrian proposal that had both technical shortcomings and problems in terms of content.
What these proposals have had in common has been a failure to fit in with a coherent set of measures.
Something else they had in common was that they either conflicted with existing legal instruments or duplicated them.
The advantage of the Commission alone having the right of initiative is surely that this ensures a systematic approach and guarantees that we have documents that are more precise and free from technical and legal contradictions. This applies in particular to matters for which Commissioner Vitorino is responsible.
Another clear indication of the shortcomings of Member States' right of initiative is that they are seldom received with very much enthusiasm, even by other Member States.
This also applies to the initiative before us today, which the Portuguese Presidency is no longer treating as a priority.
So, as a Parliament, we have more reason than ever before to be sceptical about this right of initiative on the part of Member States. This is not only because this right skews the balance between the institutions but also because, up to now, it has never really been convincingly exercised.
I would also like to touch upon another problem connected with this, which might perhaps warrant a joint initiative by the Member States.
Officials working at the Schengen external borders are constantly telling us that the residence permits presented by third country nationals and issued by other EU Member States still vary widely and are often difficult to identify as such.
This does not seem to fit in with the Joint Action concerning a uniform format for residence permits.
The Member States should take the initiative here and act in compliance with the EU format in their own administrative area.
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to say that I am speaking as much as a Finn as in my capacity as a representative of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
I would thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson of the opinion for the frank, direct and sincere words they have written about Finland' s initiative.
The report states that the initiative was poorly planned, that it contains no justification section, that it was prepared without organisations such as ECRE or UNHCR being consulted and that the relationship between the principles of readmission between the Member States and the principles of readmission to third countries is not made clear.
Furthermore, the report states that there is a lack of strategic vision, something which the rapporteur also said.
No distinction is made between those who do not fulfil and those who no longer fulfil the conditions in force for residence here.
It is all too reminiscent of Austria' s initiative on that famous first day of Austria' s Presidency.
There are also no procedural safeguards, which does not surprise me because, less than two months ago, the same Ministry of the Interior which is behind the present initiative proposed that Finnish immigration law be changed to include rapid repatriation.
My party, the Swedish People' s Party, voted against this initiative, really for the same reasons that Finland' s constitutional committee had when it considered that the same proposal was unconstitutional because, in the case of rapid repatriation, no one has the right to be heard.
It would be wisest, therefore, if Finland were to comply with Parliament' s proposal and withdraw the proposal, as both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs propose.
I would point out that, of all the members of the Committees, only two supported this initiative.
I regret that the Council' s and Parliament' s time has been used in this way.
I think, like Mrs Berger said, that it could have been used for other things, for example, purely administrative procedures.
The issue of women as asylum seekers might also have been reflected upon, because we need to look at the Tampere decision in its entirety with a view to improving the asylum process.
I would emphasise that I am speaking as a Finn and as a representative of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
Mr President, the Karamanou report asks the European Parliament to reject the Finnish proposal to establish, within the European Union, a system for returning illegal immigrants to the Member State responsible.
According to this initiative, a Member State which arrests illegal immigrants in its territory could return them to the Member State through which they entered, with the expectation that the latter would probably return them to the third country from which they originally came.
This idea is interesting for three reasons.
Firstly, it responds to a genuine problem caused by the abolition of internal borders within Europe. It therefore fills a legal void by establishing a system for the return of illegal immigrants based on the Schengen acquis and modelled on the Dublin Convention of 1990 on asylum seekers.
Secondly, it forces the Member State which is negligent in monitoring its borders to take responsibility for illegal immigrants who use it to get into neighbouring countries.
Thirdly, it shows the usefulness - whatever the previous speakers may have said - of the Member States' right of initiative which the Treaty of Amsterdam retained as a transitional measure in matters relating to immigration and the movement of people.
In these areas, it is important that the national governments, which are still closer to the people than the Commission, should retain a full right to make proposals and, of course, decide on these.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights totally rejects this Finnish initiative however, and, in so doing, shows a tendency to exaggerate.
It uses the pretext of legal shortcomings to reject the whole proposal whereas it could very easily, in a more positive spirit, have itself proposed corrections.
However, this initiative is disliked by the federalists who would prefer a less intergovernmental and more Community-based approach, in other words granting more power to the Commission and the European Parliament.
It is also disliked by the pro-immigration pressure groups whose influence is apparent in the explanatory statement which highlights the positive contribution of immigration and rejects a supposedly repressive initiative.
This reasoning is, of course, diametrically opposed to ours.
Mr President, the Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
Since we completely agree with her analysis and conclusion and share the view that it cannot be adopted, as it stands, I shall be very brief.
Mrs Karamanou' s report has clearly demonstrated that the subject of readmission rules between European Union Member States, although a very technical and specific issue, touches upon some very sensitive policy issues that simply need more thorough reflection and preparation before they are again tackled by the Union.
I recognise that this initiative has drawn the attention of the Council to the necessity of drafting a coherent and consistent approach to immigration policy.
That is why I stated to Parliament the Commission' s intention of presenting to the Council and Parliament in the autumn of this year a communication on immigration policy, precisely to give us the broader picture within which these partial and sectoral issues can be fully and properly integrated.
I can assure you that the Commission thinks that we should not start with this question of readmission.
We think that though questions of readmission are no doubt relevant, they should be mainly addressed in the readmission agreements that the Union is now negotiating with third countries.
Nevertheless, for the time being, it is better to see the whole picture before we start discussing small details.
So the Commission can subscribe to the approach of the rapporteur and, apparently, the large majority in Parliament, in the sense that this initiative, as it stands - and I am not passing judgement on the intention behind it - is unacceptable.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m.)
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, a gross mistake has found its way into Item 34 of the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting concerning the adoption of the resolution on Euro 2000.
The Minutes show this resolution to have been adopted by Parliament when in fact it was rejected by an overwhelming majority. Moreover, the resolution is also listed among the texts adopted whereas notification of its rejection should appear in this part.
This will obviously be corrected.
Madam President, following your statement yesterday regarding the state of the air conditioning in the building, I have a slight problem in my position as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Canada.
I have a group of Canadian members of parliament coming to the next part-session in Strasbourg. I will have to take a decision on Monday as to whether they will be travelling to Strasbourg or Brussels.
Bearing in mind the French position on the precautionary principle, can a decision be taken rather sooner than a fortnight on where we will be meeting next month?
Mr Sturdy, as you know, and as the Quaestors point out in the memo which you have received, checks will be carried out at Parliament' s three places of work, that is to say, Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg.
Unfortunately, we will then have to wait for the result of these checks.
I would therefore advise you to contact Mr Poos, so that he can keep you informed of the situation.
Madam President, I rise on the same point of order as my colleague, Mr Sturdy.
It is essential that this Parliament should show by example and precept that it follows the same standards that it imposes upon everybody else.
It imposes standards on beef in Britain and cheese in France and it must follow the same example in relation to its own conduct.
I am perfectly prepared, in an extreme situation, to die for my country and my family.
I am not prepared to die from legionnaire's disease because I have to sit in Strasbourg in June.
Therefore we should do something about it now and not just talk about it.
This is why, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking every necessary precaution at all Parliament' s places of work.
Madam President, as you may well expect, we will not enter into a debate between French and British beef producers now. However, I have two questions to ask.
Firstly, could the same checks be carried out for Parliament in Brussels?
Secondly, in accordance with the precautionary principle, can Brussels continue to be a place of work for Parliament since it is not equipped with air purifiers?
I have already answered the first question, Mr Daul, since I told you that the checks would also be carried out in Brussels as well as in Luxembourg where many people work, and this must not be overlooked.
The checks will therefore be carried out at all Parliament' s places of work, but Mr Poos will be in a much better position to answer you than myself.
Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor.
I would like to inform and at the same time reassure the Members who have just spoken on this important and serious matter.
I should like to point out to them that the College of Quaestors has acted in accordance with the precautionary principle.
In fact, if the College of Quaestors had not ordered an air quality check in these buildings, the problem would not even have been mentioned today in plenary.
This check has therefore been carried out and, as you know, it proved negative on two points.
We took the necessary steps immediately, namely closing the buildings where the problems were observed.
After technical changes had been made, we carried out a second air quality check, the results of which are available for asbestos.
The second check did not reveal any more asbestos fibres, suggesting that they had been brought in from outside, or could well have been.
We are quite certain that asbestos was not used to construct the building.
Furthermore, a second check has been carried out for the ducts contaminated with legionella bacteria, but the results of this are not available yet for purely technical reasons, as well as biological reasons, because the cultures take about a fortnight to mature.
At any rate, the results of this second check will be available by the start of the next part-session in Strasbourg, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that if they should be positive, i.e. if these pathogenic elements are found to be still present, then the College of Quaestors will advise the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents to take the necessary action.
There is therefore no cause for alarm at present.
We shall wait for the results of these checks and we shall take the necessary steps in accordance with the precautionary principle.
Madam President, in Item 5 of the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting on the withdrawal of Mr Le Pen' s mandate, there are two half truths in the references to my speech and to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and two half truths can add up to one untruth.
Firstly, the Minutes state that Mr Medina Ortega 'questioned whether the letter from the committee' s chairman truly reflected the opinion of the committee as a whole' .
What I said was that the letter read out by the President and sent by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi was not the opinion of the committee. It had not been adopted by the committee and therefore was not its opinion.
It is not a question of whether or not it reflected the committee' s opinion: reflecting an opinion is not the same as being an actual opinion.
Secondly, the Minutes then state that Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi 'confirmed that the letter faithfully reflected the committee' s position' .
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi is not here but, if I remember rightly, what she said was something along the lines of it being her opinion of what had taken place in committee, although it had not been adopted by the committee.
Although I am aware that I am splitting hairs here, I should like to make it clear that what I said was that it was not the committee' s opinion and that, in some way, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi acknowledged that it was her opinion of what happened in committee.
In this way, the two half truths could be turned into two complete truths.
Mr Medina, I suggest that we listen again to the recording of the sitting and, if necessary, make the changes you specify.
However, given that this is a very delicate area, I think we must listen to the recording of the sitting first in order to see whether these changes are really necessary.
If they appear to be necessary, the changes will indeed be made.
Madam President, it is all very well Mr Poos saying that the Quaestors asked for the air quality check.
I understand that the staff asked for an air quality check before this building was opened.
I asked for an air quality check in January.
Why has it taken so long to get that air quality check?
Usually, in a lot of countries, if legionella bacteria is found in any part of a building, that building is closed.
Are there any other comments on the Minutes?
There are no further comments.
(The Minutes were approved)
Vote
Madam President, I rise under Rule 126(3) so that I might question whether a quorum exists for this vote.
Despite the unprecedented presence of some French Members, my assessment is that Fridays in Strasbourg do not function properly and effectively for this Parliament and we should transfer more of our parliamentary work to the capital city, Brussels.
- (PT) Madam President, I would like to speak in reaction to the blatant hypocrisy of the request that has just been made.
During yesterday' s vote on the Buitenweg report, we witnessed some very serious goings-on in this Parliament.
Rules of Procedure were brushed aside so that we could proceed to the vote on the Buitenweg report, which bears the name of one of the leading lights of the group, whose spokesperson today is Mr Duff, perhaps because of some embarrassment on the part of Mrs Buitenweg.
Given what happened yesterday, which none of us has forgotten - we were forced to listen to hypocritical statements about great principles when, in the April part-session, for example, a motion on Ethiopia was sacrificed - I would ask the leaders of this group to show, at least in this part-session, some remorse at what they have done and some respect for their colleagues.
Madam President, I should like to convey our support and sympathy for the people of Paraguay in the light of another attempted military coup.
That is all I wished to say.
I should like the position of this House to be made very clear.
Madam President, due to the absence of two dozen Members and the request for the quorum which we would have established without any difficulty, our Group yesterday chose to refrain from preventing the Buitenweg report from being put to the vote when this would have been quite possible.
According to the agenda, the vote should have taken place today since the amendments were not put to the House in time yesterday.
I appealed to the House to act fairly.
I would urge the Members dealing with this matter to declare a moratorium.
We are about to take up the matter of enhancing the status of Fridays.
Of course, the best way to do this would have been by voting on this important report today.
However, I believe Mrs Buitenweg cannot attend today' s sitting.
In any event, we must nevertheless enhance the status of Fridays.
Our Group is in the process of taking appropriate precautionary action.
I would urge you to let us work fairly and to stop deliberately disrupting our work.
As I already said yesterday, I can tell you again that within the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, we are in fact in the process of enhancing the status of the work undertaken on Fridays.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to address the mover of the motion, Mr Duff, since this is still, after all, a question on a point of order which is to be debated in this House.
Mr Duff, yesterday a vote was taken in the House on the Buitenweg report, as a result of which, the Karamanou and SÃ¶rensen reports have to be put to the vote this morning.
This is also the reason why Mrs Buitenweg, who is otherwise requesting a quorum on this, is nobly expressing her reservation because she knows that voting on these reports this morning is the fair thing to do.
In this respect, Mr Duff' s request might have been overlooked among the large number of requests made.
He has not been given any information, which explains why he has made this request now.
I would therefore urge Andrew to withdraw his request, since Mrs Buitenweg and others want a vote to be taken on the SÃ¶rensen and Karamanou reports this morning.
I would certainly suggest that Mrs Buitenweg and others refrain from making a big fuss about it this morning in order to avoid embarrassing scenes.
Madam President, the issue of requests for the quorum to be tested does not have anything to do with whether we work in Strasbourg rather than in Brussels.
Personally, I would prefer to work in Strasbourg, but I consider that if we have decided to work on Fridays - and this seems to me to be the issue here - then on Fridays the quorum needs to be present.
I do not feel that it is right to vote in favour of working on Fridays and then be absent.
With regard to whether requests for the quorum to be tested are intended to sabotage proceedings, I would refer you to events in the Italian Parliament.
I myself have requested that the quorum be checked many, many times, and, on most of those occasions, the quorum was not present.
Yet I have never been accused of sabotaging proceedings and I doubt that the war which has broken out between Ethiopia and Eritrea was caused by the fact that, last time, the quorum was not present.
Madam President, as Chairperson of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I was a touch surprised at the request to establish that a quorum was present today.
We moved our two topics so that Mrs Buitenweg' s report could be discussed and voted on yesterday.
Mrs SÃ¶rensen' s and Mrs Karamanou' s reports were therefore moved to yesterday evening to be debated, and were to be voted on today.
I think it is odd, to say the least, that our colleagues should behave in this way.
It may perhaps be possible for my colleague to withdraw the proposal and appreciate the need to realise that half the earth' s population consists of women.
It is an extremely serious document which Mrs SÃ¶rensen has written and which we shall be voting on today.
I would most earnestly ask my colleagues to stop trifling with this Parliament and withdraw their proposal - perhaps with the help of Mrs Buitenweg.
Madam President, I just wanted to correct what Mr Posselt said.
He said that he did not think there was a quorum on the vote on Mrs Buitenweg's report.
By my calculations, 242 people voted on that report including about 35 Members of the PPE, and they should be congratulated on supporting that excellent report yesterday.
Madam President, before we take a vote - and I would rather a vote not be taken straight away - I should also like to join Mrs Theorin in appealing to Mr Duff as a friend and colleague to withdraw his request to establish the quorum.
Last time, at the Friday sitting here in Strasbourg, a request of this type had a disastrous effect on the European Parliament' s image.
It was broadcast on television the same day that there were not enough Members present in plenary to discuss aid to Ethiopia. Pictures of children who had died from famine and starving people were shown at the same time by the same channels.
The same thing will happen today with the fight against trafficking in women.
Pictures of poor girls living in districts that are unfit for habitation will be shown, and it will be broadcast that not enough Members were present in Parliament to discuss the matter.
So, please, I beg you to withdraw your request to establish the quorum, and let us take a vote!
Mr Duff, do you uphold your request?
We shall then see if 32 Members join you.
Madam President, should these reports be serious then they certainly deserve a quorum.
What I will do is to press my point of order.
Very well, so are there 32 Members to support this request?
(24 Members rose) The request is therefore withdrawn.
We shall now proceed to the vote. First, we shall examine the text of the initiative from the Republic of Finland.
The Commission proposes that the initiative be rejected.
Madam President, I think you are mistaken as the voting list is different.
If we want to reject Finland' s initiative, we must vote against it.
That is primarily what we are voting on.
So whoever votes in favour, votes for the Finnish proposal which was rejected by committee.
Whoever votes against, rejects the Finnish proposal and thus gives the Commission the responsibility of presenting a relevant proposal, as represented by the subsequent amendments tabled.
Madam President, this is a very complicated process as Mrs Karamanou has already explained.
I would therefore urge you to allow me to very briefly explain the process once again.
I have also agreed to do this with the member of the PPE Group who works as a coordinator in our committee, since the PPE has proposed two amendments, although only for the legislative resolution.
The text of the resolution itself should be rejected. However, I would urge a vote to be taken on the legislative resolution, together with both amendments, in which it is pointed out that we invite the Council to put forward a new draft text.
The present text should therefore be rejected and the Council invited in the legislative resolution to submit a new text.
It therefore comes down to the rather unusual process of the text which is actually to be voted on being rejected, but a vote then having to be taken on the legislative resolution.
I would urge that this rather remarkable procedure be carried out.
It gives us the chance to obtain a new text.
Indeed, it is quite complicated.
You would therefore like me to put the draft initiative from the Republic of Finland to the vote straight away.
(Parliament rejected the proposal, which was referred back to committee) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
(A5-0127/2000) by Mrs SÃ¶rensen, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament "For further actions in the fight against trafficking in women" (COM(1998) 726 - C5-0123/1999 - 1999/2125(COS))
Before the start of the vote

Madam President, on the same point of order that Mr Duff raised earlier, the roll-call vote has just shown that we are not quorate, so therefore, under the same rules, I would like to ask for the quorum to be established and I call on Members to support me by standing.
(19 Members rose)
President.
The request is withdrawn.
Relating to Amendment No 10
Madam President, with regard to this amendment, there is a linguistic problem.
The French version contains the word "dÃ©lit" , whereas this is written as "crime" in the English version.
As you know, Madam President, this does not have the same meaning in French.
The amendment seeks to correct this.
I am not the one who tabled the amendment, but it does seem to me that this is the point of it.
I wanted to point this out.
Relating to Amendment No 5
Madam President, in the course of discussions with Mrs Martens of the PPE-DE Group, we decided to alter the amendment to paragraph 19 in this way.
It stresses the vital role played by the NGOs, which might also include humanitarian organisations in Europe that have set themselves the task of receiving and supporting the victims.
I endorse this amendment.
You are therefore proposing an oral amendment to replace the words 'the churches and religious organisations' with 'humanitarian organisations' .
Madam President, I am not quite clear as to whether the words 'church organisations' should appear in the text.
If not, I should like us to return to the original wording.
You, Madam President, said one thing and Mrs SÃ¶rensen another.
Would you be so kind as to repeat what the oral amendment should really consist of?
In order to make things crystal clear, I think that the best thing would be to listen to the rapporteur again so that everyone understands in his own language exactly what the oral amendment which you are proposing would consist of.
I apologise for the lack of clarity.
The oral amendment alters Amendment No 5 to paragraph 19 as follows: we want to keep "stresses the vital role played by NGOs" and then the words in bold in the original amendment are to be altered thus: "which may also include humanitarian organisations in Europe that have set themselves the task of receiving and supporting the victims" .
And so 'the Churches and religious organisations' is to be replaced by "humanitarian organisations" , because that is a much broader concept.
Madam President, it was with great pleasure that I voted for the SÃ¶rensen report.
I fully approve the contents of the report, but, sadly, I feel that it fails to get to the root of the issue.
The motion for a resolution states that 500 000 people, victims of trafficking in women, enter Europe every year.
The true responsibility for trafficking in women lies with the men who take advantage of them in Europe - in the order of 180 million people, according to my calculations.
The point I am trying to make in this explanation of vote can also be found on page 11, line 14 of the report, and it is the only line out of the 722 making up the report which reaches the crux of the matter: it states that we must fight for "information and awareness-raising activities with a view to reducing the demand side" .
Out of the 7 213 words in this report, a mere handful are dedicated to the truth.
- (FR) Once again we are confronted with one of the most sordid aspects of contemporary society: trafficking in human beings.
And once again, Parliament responds to this by using an incoherent form of language whose repetition is discouraging.
Indeed, whilst the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities rightfully condemns trafficking in women and children as an intolerable violation of basic human rights, at the same time it denounces what it considers to be the disastrous effects of the prohibition of prostitution.
But are the measures which we are rightfully calling for from national and Community institutions any good if we politicians fail to proclaim, beforehand, that this truly basic right to human dignity is being violated by sexual exploitation, particularly prostitution?
Let us take advantage of the fact that Parliament is presently involved in the work of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to think about the direction we want this to take. Is it about proclaiming a vision of the human being, and the sacredness and intrinsic dignity thereof, or recognising the rights of individuals in isolation and of separate impenetrable communities?
I will be told in reply that prostitution has always existed and that we should instead try to limit the damage it does.
This scourge, like so many others, has certainly always existed and regrettably will no doubt always exist, but our task as elected representatives forces us to take a better and wider perspective, regarding what destroys the human being not as an inevitability but as a crime to be combated.
The libertarian decriminalisation measures have proved to be inefficient and dangerous no matter what the field.
Let me remind some of my colleagues of the role played by these laws: by prohibiting certain practices, they set limits intended to protect those persons, male and female, who for different reasons are easy targets for criminal networks which exploit, and prosper on, their poverty.
If these laws are not enough to break up the networks, then we must also provide the competent authorities with the means to conduct a campaign which is all the more efficient since it will be supported by unambiguous legislation.
The unspeakable excesses of some people are often a sign of some distress which must also be put right.
It is criminal to use the weakness of certain individuals to promote a libertarian ideology which spreads distress further afield and ultimately smells of death.
- (FR) The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities proposes a large number of ambitious legal measures in the SÃ¶rensen report.
Nevertheless, all the proclaimed rights, protective measures and international cooperation are only any good if they are inspired by the higher fundamental principles which they are intended to serve.
It would therefore be useful for us to start by solemnly reasserting that the dignity of all human beings is at stake here, and that any compromise with practices violating this is irresponsible and criminal.
When you know about the terrible things that go on within paedophile networks, when you see women displayed as goods for sale in shop windows in European capitals, and when you are aware of the distress suffered by the victims of this exploitation, you can only reject the thoughtless and criminal texts which suggest decriminalisation based on a libertarian ideology with no regard for the need to protect, albeit imperfectly, the weakest members of society.
It is essential that, in Member States and in any cooperation between them, the basic principles of human dignity regain a central place, and are promoted and defended by policies to protect victims and prosecute those responsible.
It is essential that an ambitious development aid policy is implemented beforehand.
This must be concerned with offering poor countries the means to develop, so that they can give their inhabitants the chance of a decent life: this process has an economic facet, but also in particular cultural and educational aspects.
Admittedly, there is a constant demand for what is called 'the sex industry' , but we must try to prevent adults from selling themselves or their children to such networks because it is the only means of meeting their needs.
It is particularly through educating young people as well as adults that these people will be able to create their own means of subsistence in their respective regions.
At the same time, it is also up to us to create in our own countries the legal and social frameworks necessary for helping the victims and fighting against a scourge all too often presented as an inevitability or even a quaint tradition.
Non-NAFO vessels
The next item is the report (A5-0101/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non-Contracting Parties to the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) (COM(1999) 570 - C5-0041/2000 - 1999/0231(CNS)).
Madam President, Commissioner, regional fisheries organisations, which regulate fishing operations outside the 200 miles of exclusive economic zones, play a fundamental role in the regulation and rational management of fishery resources in international waters.
They will be called upon to play an even more important role in the immediate future.
As a result, the European Union must strengthen its presence in such regional organisations, in those that already exist and in those that may be created in the future.
Unfortunately, in terms of human and technical resources, the European Commission is, in our opinion, currently unable to be present in each and every one of these regional fisheries organisations with the commitment they deserve, or in a way that reflects the important interests the different Community fleets have in the various oceans on this planet.
NAFO is an exception and has perhaps become the best attended, most regulated and most monitored organisation of them all.
It is also true that the Commission is paying greater attention to some of these organisations, as in the case of the ICCAT. This is certainly an organisation that is no stranger to pressure from this House and, more specifically, from our Committee on Fisheries.
However, there are a number of other organisations - to mention only those that relate to the tuna species - and, alongside the aforementioned Atlantic tuna organisation, there is a pressing need for our presence in, and commitment to, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the IOTC, the Inter-American Commission for Tropical Tuna, the IATTC, or the MHLC, the Multilateral High Level Conference, which is negotiating the convention that will govern the Western Pacific Council.
The European Commission needs to have an effective presence, both in terms of human and technical resources, in all these organisations and, as I said, in those that may be created in the future.
Parliament will help, and we shall spare no effort in ensuring that, in such organisations, the European Union has a level of influence that corresponds to our fisheries sectors. These sectors are calling for such an influence in view of third countries which, incidentally, sometimes defend their interests more vigorously than we defend ours.
NAFO has served as a model in many cases.
The regulation we are now considering represents an attempt to incorporate decisions adopted by the organisation in 1997, 1998 and 1999 into Community legislation to make our internal measures more effective.
In this case, we are dealing with the thorny issue of trying to ensure that vessels which are not part of the organisation respect the rules laid down by regional fisheries organisations. Such vessels, whether operating under flags of convenience or not, simply act freely whilst others respect provisions on the conservation of resources and, of course, contribute to these respective laws.
We support the measures drawn up, measures which are still scarce and difficult to apply, but which will continue to increase the world' s awareness of responsible fishing and trade and make such awareness more effective.
The measures suggested by this House' s Committee on Fisheries are along these lines. They are measures which clarify some concepts to ensure greater accuracy and improve, as far as possible, upon the already significant control measures in NAFO waters.
As we all know, a Community vessel that was operating in NAFO waters, the Santa Mafalda, has been ordered into the Portuguese port of Aveiro with Canadian NAFO inspectors on board.
Whilst we await the findings of the port inspection, we ask everyone to comply with the NAFO fisheries' regulatory measures. These measures on the conservation of resources are essential if such resources are to be maintained.
We also call on the Canadian authorities to behave in accordance with NAFO control measures and not to exceed their authority. During the plenary sitting on this matter, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President of the Commission, acknowledged that they had exceeded their duties in appropriating the ship' s documentation without the authorisation of the captain of the vessel.
Attitudes such as these remind us of a time we thought we had left behind, a time when Canada created a crisis, which we do not wish to see repeated under any circumstances.
Therefore, we ask for a forceful response from the European Commission to Canada over their behaviour and - I should like to stress this and then conclude - we ask everyone to behave appropriately in order to conserve resources and we ask them to comply strictly with the rules laid down by NAFO.
Madam President, Commissioner, for some time we have been observing with increasing concern an influx of vessels, which do not belong to NAFO, the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, into the North-West Atlantic.
To be quite frank, the owners of these vessels are stealing fish.
They deliberately refuse to join NAFO, of which the European Union is a member.
They think they can shirk all their responsibilities by doing so.
We have known for a long time what kind of problems the fishing industry as a whole has to contend with.
Overfishing certainly plays an important part in this regard. What we therefore need, at the end of the day, is a coherent fishing policy, not just in our waters, but worldwide, where all parties act in concert and cannot play their own game.
This concerns everyone: the international community, individual countries and the European Union.
NAFO is therefore more important than you would think for everyone, and not just for the European Union.
The consequences of uncontrolled fishing have already been disastrous, particularly for cod and redfish, two highly valued sources of food.
Regulations - that is, either a total ban on fishing or at least clear restrictions on fishing - have been in force for both types of fish on the part of NAFO ever since the 1990s.
In spite of all the efforts even simply to make these often stateless vessels comply with the protective and conservation measures, fishing continues to proceed unabated.
The problem for the European Union was previously the lack of a unified system of control when checking vessels of non-contracting parties in EU ports because they are obviously not subject to Community law.
By transferring the NAFO regulations as international law directly into Community law which is in force in all EU Member States, the regulation presently under discussion thus gains importance.
The NAFO regulations - and their assimilation in a unified system - which control and, if necessary, sanction the non-contracting parties and their frequently stateless vessels and fishing, are therefore the most important matter dealt with in the regulation.
Those who took part in a psychological study which exists in Germany, and which is appropriately named the 'Fishing Game' , always headed for a resources catastrophe when they acted in isolation.
In the final analysis, every one of them always took whatever was still left and this could no longer be replaced at the end.
If we do not want to just have the choice between unreliable sources of food or unreliable fishing, then a functional form of cooperation between all the parties involved would be in our interests.
As a member of NAFO, and with a large number of Member States of its own, the EU fulfils the requirements for this.
We therefore welcome this initiative, but would like a few minor points to be clarified in our motions in order to achieve greater coherency between NAFO and the EU.
A final word on this interesting term 'international law '.
EU law also has its origins in international law.
Certainly, we must now realise that EU Community law has become a term in its own right, and that this must be analogous to the evolving definition of the term 'European Union' .
Mr President, in his speech, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has already mentioned the forceful response from the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kinnock, to my question on the boarding by Canadian inspectors of a Portuguese fishing vessel in NAFO waters.
If we are to maintain the balance in this important organisation - and in what is an extremely important fishing ground for the Community fleet - then the only way to do so is for everyone to behave responsibly.
The proposal for a regulation under discussion today, on control measures for vessels from countries which are non- Contracting Parties to NAFO, is very much linked to this sense of responsibility that is so necessary in the fisheries sector.
I am referring to the responsibility we all share for managing marine resources, in accordance with rules accepted by all parties to guarantee that such resources are preserved and that ours will not be the last generation to see cod, redfish or American plaice.
Regional fishing organisations have played an increasingly important role over recent years in the management of resources.
In this respect, we, the Socialists, would like to continue developing the idea that encourages this sense of responsibility.
Legal philosophies dating from times gone by have been left behind, times when man felt how small he was in relation to the immensity of the Earth, which appeared to be a planet with infinite resources.
The lack of ownership of the seas and the principle that the sea belongs to no one sprang from such ideas.
However, nowadays, in a world that is becoming ever smaller, a world dominated by new technologies that make the world even smaller and with resources we know are becoming more and more scarce, we, the Socialists would like to move forward on the principle that the sea belongs to everyone.
For this reason, we would like NAFO to be - and indeed it is - an organisation open to countries that have vessels operating in this area.
In this way, such countries would play a part in creating regulatory measures and would share responsibility for managing resources.
If this does not happen, flags of convenience, euphemistically known as 'non-Contracting Parties' , will benefit, not to mention the piracy which lies behind the euphemism, 'stateless vessels' .
Such vessels - which we are often keen to believe have nothing to do with us - do not come from remote southern seas, but rather almost always originate from European ports, from Community ports.
They fly strange flags and their aim is to practise social dumping. In so doing, they avoid regulations on the rational management of resources and pay no attention to workers' social rights.
People who idolise the market should note from this that neither fish nor people gain anything from their hypotheses.
Lastly, it is extremely important that countries with vessels operating in NAFO waters are Contracting Parties, just as it is important that the European Community is also a Contracting Party to regional organisations being set up in the South Atlantic and beyond the area the Community fleet currently operates in.
Our fleet, the Community fleet, does not wish to be seen as a pirate fleet, as a fleet without nationality, nor as an intruding fleet.
To conclude, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to state that it wholeheartedly agrees with the content of this report although it regrets, as does the rapporteur himself, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, that there is a lack of proposed measures from the Commission on combating the main enemy of our fleet and of the conservation of fishery resources today. This enemy is none other than those vessels flying flags of convenience.
I would very much like to support this report.
It is extremely important and it is very important to support the attempts of NAFO to halt this very problematic activity of non-contracting parties.
The reality of the situation is that "vessels from non-contracting parties" usually means vessels flying flags of convenience or flags obtained from countries which have open registers.
These are countries which will allow shipowners the right to fly their flag if they pay the country a fee.
Under international law, it is the responsibility of the state whose flag vessels fly to ensure that they abide by the relevant rules and regulations; for example, conservation measures, safety and labour standards, etc.
The big problem is that these countries selling flags of convenience have no intention of enforcing these rules, and that is the main reason why they appeal to these unscrupulous shipowners who can do what they like.
They can flout the law and no one is going to try and enforce it.
All the shipowner has to do is pay a bit of money to the country to get the flag which will allow him to fish with impunity.
This really has to stop.
The list of these countries is very long, but the traditional ones are Belize, Panama, Honduras and St Vincent and the Grenadines.
Many of these vessels have been active in the NAFO area, but that is not the only place where they operate.
Very large numbers have also been fishing for tuna in the Atlantic where the regional organisation is ICAT.
ICAT has done more than any other regional organisation to try and combat fishing by flags of convenience.
Most dramatically - and this is something that other people should take their lead from - is that it has now imposed import bans on bluefish tuna from one of its own members, Equatorial Guinea.
ICAT really does mean business and other people should follow suit.
Organisations like ICAT and NAFO cannot solve the problem on their own.
The responsibility lies in many other quarters and this responsibility needs to be taken seriously.
Many shipowners like to use flags of convenience for it lets them get away with just about anything.
There is no way of enforcing the law.
The countries that sell allow them to fly their flags; they turn a blind eye and do not care.
This is why it is so popular.
The EU is among the worst in this sense.
According to Lloyd's Maritime Services, in December 1999 there were 1,323 vessels over 24 metres flying flags of convenience. Of these, 168 were owned by companies based in EU Member States.
By far the worst, of course, and not surprising, is Spain with 116 vessels, but of course they are not alone.
Each country tends to have their preferred flag use.
For instance, the French vessels tend to use flags of RÃ©union, St Vincent and the Seychelles.
For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama.
The Dutch use Belize and St Vincent and 4 vessels, of course, from my own country are flagged in Belize as well.
The preferred British countries are Panama and Belize.
It is not surprising that Belize is there, considering last year' s revelations about Michael Ashcroft, the Tory Party treasurer' s business connections there.
The Spanish fleet is distributed across a very long list including Belize, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, Panama and many others.
The only place which has more of these flags of convenience is Taiwan, with 117, which just beats Spain into first place.
Last year, the Commission was actually trying to do something; it proposed refusing to grant subsidies for transferring ship ownership to countries with open registers.
The Council refused.
It wants to use public money to fund ways of breaking the rules, and that is not acceptable.
At least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public's attention.
For the past two weeks, Greenpeace has had a ship in the middle of the South Atlantic where they have found plenty of vessels catching tuna, flying these flags of convenience.
They have also found a transport vessel, flagged in Panama and owned in Japan, both contracting parties to ICAT by the way, which was receiving fish from non-contracting vessels from Belize.
This is very much against ICAT rules and I really think we have to address it.
The European Union has to take responsibility on this issue.
Mr President, I too should like to welcome this proposal for a regulation from the Commission which improves upon certain control measures within NAFO.
I have often voiced my opinion that NAFO fishing grounds are undoubtedly among the most regulated in the world. Such vigilance is sometimes the result of excessive mistrust, on the part of some Contracting Parties - who have almost unlimited power in NAFO - towards other parties who operate completely legitimately.
We all remember the unjust and regrettable incidents that took place a few years ago, regarding a Community vessel. These incidents were the product of suspicion bordering on persecution which has often concealed a desire to throw a smoke screen around management errors in some coastal states.
This is why I must applaud the fact that this proposal aims at incorporating into Community legislation three NAFO recommendations on controlling activities of vessels of non-Contracting Parties, and in particular non-Contracting Parties whose activities are, without a shadow of a doubt, much more suspect than those of any Community fleet.
As is usual procedure when discussing the transposition of measures into Community law, I must once again express my disappointment over the Commission' s delay in starting to work on adapting legislation.
If it is indeed true that the proposal covers NAFO' s latest recommendations on sightings and transhipments from its annual meetings in 1998 and 1999, it is also true to say that this represents nothing more than a reworking of the 1997 recommendation, which is only now being taken into account.
Besides this now traditional complaint, this proposal for a regulation represents an opportunity to debate the real problem of flags of convenience and discuss what the European Union is doing to deal with them.
Given the current state of marine resources, and at a time when there is growing awareness of the need for real protection of marine ecosystems, the fight against illegal fishing must become a priority and vessels flying flags of convenience should be first on the list.
The European Union is responsible for taking the lead in the fight against such harmful forms of fishing and must be capable of putting forward its own alternatives.
The first step must be to propose unified and clear measures in the fight against such activity to Member States. The aim of such common rules is to ban the flying of such flags and stop Member States allowing these fleets to dock in their ports.
Currently, not all Community ports are aware that, directly or indirectly, they are often providing cover for illegal activity.
We can only develop their awareness through an information campaign and by introducing rigorous measures to accompany it.
Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on the amount of work he has put into this, indeed into all issues that come before the Committee on Fisheries.
The whole question of what we do to protect marine life outside our waters is not a very popular issue.
It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union.
There is a growing understanding of the efforts that the European Union is making, and I would say that for the many years during which the Common Fisheries Policy has existed, the Union has failed, to a large extent, to convince the European public of the importance of the role it has been playing in trying to establish the facts of marine life, to provide the public with the scientific information and to take the necessary action.
Too often we do not get the sort of support from Member States and from national governments that is needed to convince the public that determined and substantial efforts have to be made to enforce all the laws and regulations.
In spite of these efforts, something like 80% of all the major stocks are still over-exploited and continue to diminish.
The measures before us may be the best that we can manage, but they seem rather weak and hardly sufficient to achieve what we want.
We are the biggest market and the most lucrative market in the world for fish products.
We should be prepared to use our muscle and impose every necessary trade sanction on all the states and all the products that are associated with this illegal trade.
It is not just a matter of protecting our interests, because stocks outside our 200-mile limit can be affected by our activities.
Stocks within our limit can be affected by activities outside it.
There is also the whole question of our obligation to protect this resource that belongs to mankind.
I believe that for some people who have the money to buy large ships and equip them in today's world there is no limit to the capacity that can be applied to extracting resources from the sea.
I do not think that individuals should have the right, just because they have the money and capacity and because they happen to live in a certain region, to go out and exploit those resources and become very rich as has happened in some instances.
We may be reaching the point where this resource is tendered and paid for and the public can get some compensation from those who get rich very quickly - they are already doing this in New Zealand.
The European Union in its review of the Common Fisheries Policy should take into account the fact that this is a public resource and that a small number of people think they have the right to go out and get rich from it.
There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation.
In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are, to get them, and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that.
I would like to express my sincere thanks for the interest you have shown in the proposal for the Council regulation in question.
As you know, the aim of the regulation is to implement at Community level a very important NAFO scheme intended to counteract non-contracting party activities which risk undermining the effectiveness of NAFO conservation measures.
In this context, I should stress that the Community, as a contracting party to NAFO, has every interest in measures that help to resolve problems caused by states which do not discharge their cooperation and conservation obligations under international law.
In respect of the proposed amendments, I should stress the following.
Amendment No 1 does not seem to be necessary.
In fact, recital 3 of the version proposed by the Commission is correct because we are actually dealing with the practice of using non-contracting party vessels.
What is more, this wording is drawn from the language used in other legal texts, for instance the Council decision concerning the approval by the Community of the FAO compliance agreement and the Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non-contracting parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.
Amendment No 2 is relevant and will be taken on board.
Amendment No 3 is not acceptable to the Commission.
There is no need to impose an obligation on individual vessels.
If it merely involves spelling out a faculty for individual vessels, there is no need to regulate.
Furthermore, the terms "proceed to a formal sighting" can be construed as an obligation for the Community inspection vessel to direct itself towards non-contracting party vessels in order to make a sighting formal.
Such an obligation would divert the inspection vessel from the performance of its existing tasks, which is certainly not acceptable.
I hope that what I have had to say has contributed to a better understanding and thank you again for the time and effort you have put into this proposal.
The debate is closed.
I have been up in my room just now, and it is little surprising that Fridays are so devalued.
The television technicians have gone home, so the television pictures are of the Assembly and no longer of the original speakers.
The staff are apparently running for the exits from 9 a.m. on Friday mornings, so it is hardly surprising that Fridays are being devalued.
I would ask you to check that the whole service of Parliament is available so long as the House is sitting.
I will pass on your comments to the Bureau but as regards the TV system we have considered this question before.
During the last Parliament, when Mr Gutierrez traditionally took the chair on Fridays, he asked for full television coverage of the sitting.
We tried this for a period of six months and no television network ever took any of the broadcasts and so the practice was discontinued as it was extremely expensive.
I do not wish to embark on a discussion of this issue now but you can rest assured I will pass on your remarks to the Bureau.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE
I would like to congratulate Mr Varela on his report on vessels flying non-Community flags that are non-contracting parties to NAFO, which was adopted unanimously.
As Ms McKenna rightly said, the use of flags of convenience makes it possible to flout all the regulations.
My father had a bar in Genoa next to the Panama consulate - and I am not criticising the Panama consulate or any other consulate, for that matter - and I am therefore very aware that laws are violated.
For example, people who did not know how to swim or row were allowed to set sail, for only a passport was required, not a seaman' s book.
We will be staffing ships with sailors who do not know how to swim, next.
Protection of juveniles of marine organisms
The next item is the report (A5-0103/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fifth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 570 - C5-0041/2000 - 1999/023(CNS))
Mr President, Commissioner, before I begin my speech, I should like to highlight the unanimity in this House over the previous report so that the Commission reflects upon the reasons underlying the amendments we have tabled.
I hope that such unanimity leads them to reconsider their position on these two amendments that you said you would not adopt.
In any event, regarding the report we are currently debating, I should like to point out that the specific aim of these technical measures is to protect juveniles of marine organisms in order to reduce the threat to future yields.
As a result, alongside the Commission, we are aiming and endeavouring to protect fishery resources.
As you know, such measures include rules on the size of fishing gear, - and of meshes in particular - minimum allowable landing sizes, specific closed areas, protection of endangered species and so on.
The governing Regulation No 850/98 entered into force on 1 January of this year, but it must obviously continue to be periodically adapted to incorporate any new data and scientific innovations which may emerge.
In the case we are currently dealing with, we are discussing the fifth amendment which will enable the Commission to include various new measures that, in our opinion, are fully justified.
We are talking about nets for shrimp fishing, closed areas for fishing for sand eels and a review of the minimum size for certain bivalve molluscs and crustacea.
The Commission' s proposed revisions and additions to Annex XII appear to be reasonable.
However, in the newly added case of deepwater rose shrimp, the carapace length of 24 millimetres seems excessive and could cause problems for fishermen. As a result, your rapporteur has introduced an amendment, which has already been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, suggesting a compromise of setting this restriction at 22 millimetres.
This compromise, of course, has already been agreed with the Member States as being more appropriate.
We also feel that reducing the size of carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres, which has been widely called for by the sector, is a very positive step.
Therefore, it is now a question of adapting certain measures that will have a positive impact on economic and social spheres whilst strictly respecting scientific reports.
To sum up, it is essential that this regulation is kept up to date and that it is based on the best available scientific recommendations.
This will not be the last amendment made given that there will be a continuing need to adapt to specific conditions and to scientific reports that emerge in the future.
For this reason, with this amendment - which I think should be taken into consideration - we accept the overall proposal from the Commission and I hope that the Commission will in turn accept our amendment.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you can see, we are dealing thoroughly with the conservation of the fish population.
A short while ago, we were still dealing with measures within the sphere of NAFO. We will now depart from the subject of offshore fishing in the ocean and go into detail on fishing in EU waters.
It is not always just whales and seals which the public wants protected, and which attract, without doubt, greater attention from them.
No, we must also direct our attention now and then to less popular species which do not look as cute.
Who as a child has ever taken a carpetshell (venerupis polastra) in his arms as he would a soft toy?
We certainly have a heart for children, but nothing concerns us quite so much as whether the juvenile fish are thriving.
We are therefore always prepared to take the necessary measures to protect them.
We must protect the periphyton of marine organisms now in order to preserve all species.
The regulation which we are dealing with is not a new one.
In fact, it is being amended again today for the fifth time.
In view of the developing populations, however, it must be amended time and time again in accordance with the requirements at a particular moment in time.
The mechanisms are improved, and new minimum sizes and fishing methods to protect species are established, as is deemed necessary by the fisherman on the spot.
In the end it is the theoretical expert who must give way to practice.
We do not have any objections to the amendments which the Commission is proposing, right down to the last detail.
They represent the latest technical and scientific developments.
I think the Commission likes to hear this, and it is also therefore appropriate to emphasise the work done by the experts dealing with this in the Commission.
Ultimately, Parliament has no interest in branding the Commission as its general scapegoat.
On the contrary, I would like to use this report to show that things can also be done differently.
The Committee on Fisheries is particularly benefiting from positive cooperation with the Commission and its services.
This cooperation is imperative for the preservation of sea populations.
Who, apart from the Commission, should monitor them and protect this natural resource?
It is not always possible to fall back on artificially bred substitutes, which furthermore have been genetically manipulated wherever possible.
Does it sound healthy to you, for instance, when I say that it is possible to breed super salmon which grow eight times faster than before?
Quantity instead of quality?
The awareness that we need to do something to preserve a healthy variety of food and the willingness to take appropriate action are the needs of the moment.
We cannot go onto a fishing ground like the Huns, destroy it, and then simply move with the caravan onto the next one without taking responsibility for what is left behind.
If the matter is worth something to us, economically as well as ecologically, we must also take appropriate action on our own doorstep and not just in the North-West Atlantic.
These measures are a step in the right direction.
I do not think that tourists, on boat trips in the future, will be able to watch sand eels as well as seals being reared, but maybe, in a few years' time, we will once again be able to say, with a clear conscience, that we can fish for this species because its preservation is guaranteed.
Mr President, we are now discussing the fifth amendment in two years to the regulation on technical measures for the conservation of juveniles of marine organisms.
This is a report of a technical nature which is of no interest whatsoever to the majority of MEPs.
However, perhaps their attitude would change a little if we were to explain exactly what it is about and how a report of this type can impact on the lives of the peoples of Europe.
For this reason, Commissioner, I shall refer specifically to the carpetshell, which is mentioned in paragraph 4. I shall refer to carpetshells as I am delighted that the Commission has reduced the minimum size for selling carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres.
Ladies and gentleman, this is a matter of 2 millimetres of carpetshell.
These millimetres are important because when the landing size was increased to the current 40 millimetres, this caused serious problems for women who harvest shellfish in my region, Galicia, as it did for the whole marketing sector and for consumers themselves.
In Galicia, shellfish gathering on foot - and this is how carpetshells are collected - is only done by women.
It would take a long and complicated explanation to say why.
The fact is that men gather shellfish at sea and using technology, albeit basic, and women gather shellfish on foot using a hoe.
Approximately 10 000 women in Galicia extract carpetshells, as shellfish are not fished but rather extracted.
These women work in a self-sacrificing way, working long days digging up hectares and hectares of beach in very difficult conditions for very low incomes. These women then see their income dwindle away as more than half their annual income is consumed by social security contributions.
Evidence seems to contradict any research the Commission used to increase the minimum landing size of these molluscs as, from 30-32 millimetres upwards, the carpetshell is mature and can reproduce.
Environmental conditions in densely populated areas where the carpetshell breeds and reproduces, such as in the estuaries of Galicia, do not allow them to reach the 40 millimetres required by the regulation which we are going to change today.
The truth is that 80% of naturally produced carpetshells fall short of the current size requirement.
If shellfish gatherers were to wait for carpetshells to reach this size, mortality would be considerable and such loss would be due to environmental conditions and not to the women' s actions.
In places where molluscs are most abundant - and I am thinking of the Ferrol and Arosa estuaries - the size of carpetshells does not exceed 36 or 38 millimetres.
Carpetshells measuring 40 millimetres are neither produced, sold nor consumed, simply because there are none.
If we wish to avoid encouraging non-compliance, one of the tasks of this or any other Parliament is to ensure that the rules reflect real conditions. In the case of harvesting shellfish on foot, such non-compliance leads to illegal fishing and to a black market subject to no health checks.
This House must realise that, by drawing up these technical measures, we are trying to protect juveniles, by allowing them to reach a certain size and breeding age, whilst at the same time trying to reduce unnecessary yields.
But for a regulation to fulfil its purpose, it must be adapted to real conditions.
As a result, not only will we benefit hard-working Galician shellfish gatherers but we will also benefit consumers as they will have access to a product that has passed all health checks. We will also encourage traders who will cease to feel persecuted by legislation that, if it were fully complied with, would lead to a shortage on the markets.
For this reason, the Group of the Party of European Socialists - which I represent - supports the proposed amendment to this regulation, in the same way as it supports the amendment from the Committee on Fisheries on the size of deepwater rose shrimp.
The only thing we hope, Commissioner, is that we do not have to review the regulation again within a year, because this would mean that both we and the European Commission had once again made a mistake in our calculations.
But, if need be, we will be here to amend it once again.
Mr President, I should like to express our support for Mr Varela' s report and, at the same time, thank the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries for being so cooperative in the Committee.
Technical measures in order, especially, to protect juvenile fish- and thus secure the quantities which can be fished in the future - may be necessary.
Up until now, measures have consisted of reductions in quotas, minimum mesh sizes for nets and fishing bans in certain periods.
It stands to reason that such measures and arrangements should be modified in the light of new needs and knowledge.
What is new is that the fisheries in which sand eel are caught off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland are to become protected areas. The reason for this is the low breeding rate of the kittiwake in recent years.
Denmark is the Member State which will be most affected by this limitation, which will reduce many fishermen' s potential catches and, in that way, affect their livelihood.
As a matter of form, I would point out that Denmark has agreed to this technical measure for a limited period.
I should like to ask the Commission if the fishermen have been compensated for their losses or been directed to other likely fishing grounds.
Because bird colonies are affected by many factors in addition to fishing, I wish to propose that the Committee on Fisheries be included in future discussions about closures or limitations on quotas against the background of what is happening on land.
What I want is for us to have the opportunity to look in depth at the different factors of relevance to bird colonies and, in that connection, to discuss the bird colonies' influence on catch sizes in relation to the principle set out under the common fisheries policy whereby the fishing industry is to be safeguarded through the optimum exploitation of marine resources.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on today's fisheries reports, both of which I am sure will receive the overwhelming acceptance of this House and both of which are extremely important in terms of protection and conservation of fishery resources.

I welcome the Commission's updating of the regulation on the protection of juveniles.
We all know that sustainable development is a learning process and we must be able to update and adapt existing legislation to protect our fish stocks.
I have paid particular attention to scientific advice which indicates the requirement for the closure of fisheries for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland.
This does not just concern the maintenance of sand eel stocks themselves, but the preservation of the entire ecosystem in these localities.
The low breeding rate of the kittiwake that Mr Busk referred to is of particular concern.
I am also happy to note, as Mr Busk confirmed, that Denmark as a Member State principally concerned with sand eel fishery has accepted these measures.
However, while these measures will hopefully contribute to improving the state of fishery resources, I am concerned that the Commission has not got it right in certain other areas: for example, in the recent report on the implementation of MAGPs and the drastic cuts that it calls for in some fleets which is of grave concern to Scots and other fishermen.
I would like to ask the Commission if they have really looked at whether cutting fleet sizes actually improves the conservation of fisheries.
I quote from the Commission's own document which says: "The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries found no evidence that stocks had, in general, deteriorated or improved since the adoption of MAGP4."
Surely we must question the effectiveness of MAGPs as a conservation measure.
The Commission also failed to take into account how fleet sizes are reduced.
I call for a more thorough investigation by the Commission into this.
In those states which have, on paper at least, been complying with MAGPs such as Spain and Portugal, what has happened to the vessels which are removed from the register?
How many would be decommissioned?
How many were scrapped?
How many were sunk and so on?
How many were simply transferred to another flag?
How many vessels continue to fish either here in the Community or elsewhere under what is, in many cases, a flag of convenience?
The Commission must get conservation measures right, but I am not convinced that MAGPs are the way to do that.
They can be circumvented easily and they do not fully take into account national measures such as days at sea.
How can the Commission reconcile this with the fact that its own report says, and I quote again: "It could be argued that a reduction in activity would have a more direct impact on the exploitation rates than a reduction in capacity."
I hope that the Commission will review its position and not impose swingeing cuts on our fleets.
In Scotland, the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas.
The new proposals to cut fleets will, ironically, fall mainly on the Scottish pelagic fleet where MAGP targets have actually been met through control measures.
I welcome today's reports on this agenda, but I hope the Commission will think again when it comes to the interrelation between fleet sizes and other conservation measures.
We have got to get this right so that in the long run fish stocks in Europe are conserved, thereby ensuring the continuing viability of our fisheries communities.
Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude for the fact that my suggestions were taken into account when this report was drawn up and, in particular, the recommendation that the size of deepwater rose shrimps be set at 22 millimetres rather than at the 24 millimetres proposed by the Commission.
Although I think that the Commission' s proposal is not unreasonable, we have to bear in mind that the size limit is being set for the first time and that this species is an important part of the catches of certain fleets in southern Spain and Portugal where, until now, they have been fishing for shrimps without any size restrictions.
In a species that does not grow very large, 2 millimetres is a great deal when trying to determine whether the profitability of some very small-scale fisheries will be increased or decreased. As I said, such fisheries are not used to fishing with minimum size restrictions.
What is more, Portugal, the other Member State involved, wanted this minimum size to be even smaller. As a result, I feel that the compromise reached is acceptable and to be commended.
I should like to thank the Commission for being so prepared to listen and to accept both suggestions from this House as well as from the Council, which were along the same lines.
I am also especially interested in the Commission' s proposal on the temporary halt on sand eel fishing in Scottish and English waters.
I must also welcome the fact that Denmark, the country most dependent on fisheries, has not raised any major objections to this measure. Their attitude should enable us to progress towards a more realistic management system of fishery resources used for industrial purposes.
I have often expressed my doubts about the idea that we should maintain large fleets in depleted ecosystems, such as those of the Community, which means that fish stocks are being destroyed in order to produce fish meal or oil.
In the European Parliament Resolution of June 1998 on this type of fishing, which was based on a report drawn up by Mr Kindermann, it was highlighted that 60% of Community yields in the North Sea, Skagerrat and Kattegat are intended for this type of industrial use.
Reports from the FAO and environmental organisations estimate that 70% of fisheries production is used to this end and say this is contributing to the destruction of stocks on a worldwide scale.
Evidently, these figures also highlight the high socio-economic dependency of some Community regions on such activity.
For this reason, while I have no desire whatsoever to eliminate this activity completely, it may be an opportune moment to debate the possibility of achieving a greater balance, taking account of the various fleets' objectives in the use of resources. Eventually, this new balance should be borne in mind when distributing Community funds for structural measures as well as administrative and market policy measures.
Mr President, firstly, can I congratulate the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries on his report on the revision of the regulations on the conservation of fishery resources and technical measures for the protection of juvenile marine organisms.
This report, whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following, the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation.
Firstly, with regard to separator trawls or nets with sorting grids used in shrimp fisheries; secondly, the revision of minimum sizes for a number of bivalve molluscs and crustaceans; and thirdly, with respect to the establishment of a closed area for fishing for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland.
It is on the last proposal that I primarily wish to speak.
This is a very good example of the eco-system approach to fisheries: taking action for environmental reasons beyond those applying strictly for fish stock levels.
In 1998, a report by the Working Group on Eco-System Effects of Fishing Activities of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas identified for the first time that sea birds, specifically the kittiwake, which has been experiencing low breeding success over recent years, were in fact in competition with the industrial fleet, primarily Danish operators fishing for sand eels off the East coast of Scotland and England.
The United Kingdom requested the Commission to submit an appropriate proposal in the light of that report and the United Kingdom made initial approaches to the Danish government to encourage their support for the initiative.
It was suggested that a closed season for sand eel fishing should be introduced between April and August when the breeding birds were most dependent on sand eels for food.
The ICES subsequently looked at the science again and suggested a closed area stretching from mid-Northumberland northwards to include the Grampian coast.
This closed area is the one proposed by the Commission in December as part of the annual TAC Regulation and adopted by the Council.
These measures have, I understand, already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved.
I therefore hope the Council will be able, after this debate, to reach a speedy agreement.
It is important for the conservation of sea birds.
It is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area.
Mr President, this is an important subject.
It is highly technical and not easily understood by the public.
A gradual improvement in the regulations will contribute in the long term to the future health of the marine environment for the generations that will come after us.
We can improve our resources.
