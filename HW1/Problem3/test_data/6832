After all, this report does contain specific commitments on reducing the number of accidents in the workplace. Then there are the policies on equal opportunities.
It is important to go beyond issues relating to earnings and women's access to the labour market.
As I see it, it is also essential to ensure that the demands of the workplace can be reconciled with those of family life. National parliaments, regional assemblies, national and local authorities all have a part to play in this.
They are in a good position to identify needs. As Commissioner Vitorino stated, they are also well placed to help explore new employment opportunities with all the parties involved.
Mr President, I am going to use the time allocated to Mr Andria and Mr Mantovani too, who have asked me to express their regret because they have been detained in Italy by strikes and other such serious matters.
I shall briefly summarise their views too, insofar as I am able.
The task of the European ruling class, and the European Parliament in particular, is to rewrite the model of the social market economy, to modernise it, to revise it without reducing the social undertaking.
Job security must no longer be sought on the basis of acquired rights but through skills, hard work and lifelong learning.
Wage differentiation, which has consistently been advocated in theory but has often been disregarded in practice, must become a genuine goal for Parliament, which must specify clearly and resolutely the process to be followed to achieve it.
This commitment to reform must be upheld first and foremost by the active parties, in other words by all the social elements who will have to make responsible commitments to promoting training, innovation and flexibility, without, however, subsequently going back on them when the time comes to implement them.
The dialogue on the bargaining structure will have to reinforce both the company level and wage differentiation; where the company level is reinforced, productivity is enhanced and individual contributions are appraised.
Clearly, in order to achieve these goals, it is necessary to match bargaining at national level with bargaining at company level.
In order to provide secure jobs, we need, however, above all, as has already been said, to boost investment, the real spearhead, especially in future initiatives targeting the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Joint ventures are another way of boosting SMEs, which, we must not forget, provide over 90% of jobs in Europe.
When applying flexibility, care must be taken to ensure that it does not become an easy option for certain companies which would like to exploit this solution by creating atypical jobs such as collaboration contracts, which do not represent a secure future, especially for young people.
If we abuse this instrument, we will be in danger of creating future generations of precarious, insecure workers, but also, above all, of creating low-income future pensioners, in other words poor future pensioners.
We must therefore avoid giving way to populism in these major reforms and endeavour to take resolute, practical, achievable steps forward.
Mr President, I too wish to thank Mr Herman Schmid for his constructive work on this report.
For the benefit of Commissioner Vitorino, I wish to mention a couple of amendments that we Christian Democrats, including myself, have been involved in wording.
It is a question of the demographic challenge which, in Stockholm in March 2001, was identified as one of the Union's most important issues for the future.
It is estimated that, by 2050, the European Union will have 40 million more pensioners than at present and, thus, 40 million fewer people of working age.
This is stated in Amendment No 1, as an important part of Mr Herman Schmid's report.
I want to ask Mr Vitorino how he regards the crisis in the pensions system in relation to economic development and the survival of whole districts within the European Union against the background of the serious demographic trend.
It is encouraging that a number of amendments, including Amendments Nos 28 and 38 concerned with the reconciliation of family and professional life, are now part of Mr Herman Schmid's report.
This is an incredibly important issue, but it is not good that Amendment No 43 states that work and family life will be reconciled notably through commitments to develop childcare services.
It should be more a question of children having the right to more time with their parents than of our necessarily having to develop a form of childcare that gives children less time with their parents.
Amendment No 9 is also important.
It is about the need to strengthen the taxpaying ethic, about competition on equal terms between companies and about stepping up the fight against undeclared working.
Allow me in conclusion to put in a good word for Amendment No 60, which emphasises the value of families, family enterprises and the transition from one generation to the next.
If we are to do anything towards creating long-term jobs, the issue of how such transitions are carried out needs to be resolved.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0172/2003) by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU-USA agreements on judicial cooperation in criminal matters and extradition ((INI)2003/2003).
Mr President, I think that during our debate in the House on 14 May I stated what we perceived as the positive and negative features of the agreement now before us.
I believe the recommendation I am presenting today on behalf of the committee I chair gives a faithful account of our views.
Firstly, it is important that these agreements serve as instruments for broadening the scope of the protection of fundamental rights. This should be in line with the concept developed by Europe on the basis of our constitutions and the jurisprudence of the courts at Luxembourg and Strasbourg.
The European Union cannot base negotiations on standards lower than those it demands of itself.
This seems obvious to us and we cannot agree to extradition or to cooperation in criminal matters if the death penalty or an unfair trial might ensue. Military tribunals are an example of the latter.
Secondly, these agreements can provide an opportunity for both parties to improve their respective procedures and even their legislation.
The issue of data protection to be implemented on both sides of the Atlantic should be a case in point.
Thirdly, no international agreement can make sense unless a reciprocity clause applies to both sides. We therefore call for the situation of those European citizens detained at the GuantÃ¡namo base to be resolved once and for all.
My group does not wish signature of the agreements to be conditional on resolution. Nonetheless, we wish to state in the strongest possible terms that this situation must be resolved immediately.
Fourthly, these agreements should also provide an opportunity to strengthen our internal legislation, making it more efficient. Existing arrangements between Member States should therefore take precedence.
The European arrest warrant is a good example. These agreements should not compete with other relevant treaties such as that of the International Criminal Court.
Fifthly, agreements as important as those signed with the United States must be monitored by the Council and the Commission.
The agreements must also be monitored at parliamentary level by a joint committee comprising Members of both the European Parliament and the United States Congress. It is in both parties' interest to set up such a committee as soon as possible.
Finally, I should like to turn to the most sensitive issue, namely the procedure announced by the Council in the course of the most recent debate in plenary.
We have failed to note a positive response to our request for formal consultation between the decisions on signature and ratification of the agreements.
These are the first international European Union agreements based on both the second and the third pillar. Regular consultation of Parliament is therefore required for a number of reasons.
One reason is because consultation must be the norm for the adoption of acts pertaining to the third pillar, including acts that fall into the category of international agreements.
Another is that parliamentary monitoring of this type of agreement is the rule in all Member States. Such monitoring must therefore be deemed a common principle, and the European Union is bound to take account of it pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty of European Union.
For all these reasons we believe that consultation with Parliament is the only procedure that would comply fully with the principles of democracy and the rule of law referred to in Article 1(6) of the Treaty on European Union.
Let me put a question to you, Mr President. Now that we are drafting the a new Constitution for Europe, how could we justify to the citizens of Europe that agreements impinging directly on their human rights might come into force without being reviewed by the European Parliament?
We feel that a Council decision to consult the Parliament concerning ratification of the treaties based on Articles 24 to 38 would be very much in line with the Treaty. It would also be entirely appropriate from the point of view of institutional policy, as has already been suggested by the Commission.
Mr President, we trust the General Affairs Council will change its stance in the light of these arguments. It can only be in its interest and that of the Union as a whole for it to change its attitude and avoid creating a serious democratic deficit.
.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament, in particular Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for this report on such an important and sensitive issue.
I welcome the fact that the draft agreements have been declassified and that the opportunity has been given to the European Parliament to examine them in parallel with the examination by national parliaments in the Member States.
One must recognise that these agreements under Articles 24 and 38 are negotiated by the Council.
The Commission is not the negotiator of these agreements in the external arena.
Therefore, in this debate the Commission participates as it is associated to the negotiating process, but the Council of Ministers has the final word.
We would like to recognise the efforts made by the Belgian, Spanish, Danish and now the Greek presidencies to launch these agreements following the decision taken by the European Council after the events of 11 September 2001.
On the basis of this authorisation, and the directives for negotiations that were adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, the Commission welcomes the fact that this consultation procedure should be concluded in time to allow for signature by the European Union and the United States of America during the summit at the end of this month.
Pursuant to the authorisation given by the Council to the presidency to negotiate the agreements with the United States in April last year, the Commission assisted in the negotiations from the beginning, so it is particularly well-placed to appreciate the real difficulties experienced therein.
We understood that the Commission's role was to help to reach a positive result.
Like Parliament, in its draft recommendation, the Commission is of the opinion that stronger solutions would have been preferable on a number of points covered by these agreements.
I had the opportunity to have a constructive discussion on a number of the concerns raised by Parliament in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, together with the Greek Minister of Justice.
The Greek minister also discussed a number of these concerns in the debate that took place in plenary last month on the EU-US agreements.
Let me stress that the United States side did not get satisfaction on a number of points of major importance to them and which were strongly opposed by the Union, such as the extradition of European Union nationals and the limitations of the political offence exception to extradition.
We now need to make an overall assessment of the result of the negotiations.
One of the criteria for this assessment is the added value of a Union agreement compared with the situation that currently exists on the basis of bilateral agreements between Member States and the United States of America.
This assessment has to be made taking due account of the fact that this is, as the President mentioned, the very first Union agreement in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, and it will be a historical precedent.
In addition to the incontestable advantages that the agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance with the United States will bring in terms of concrete judicial cooperation in criminal matters and the fight against organised crime and terrorism, I would focus on the following, trying to address some of the major concerns raised by this Parliament.
Regarding protection against the death penalty, the draft extradition agreement compares with the strongest anti-death penalty clauses that can be found in existing bilateral treaties, whether an agreement with a Member State or one with a candidate country.
This means that as far as all the other bilateral agreements are concerned, this anti-death penalty provision is stronger in the current European Union agreement than in the vast majority of others.
In addition it allows the invoking of all grounds for refusal available pursuant to a bilateral extradition treaty between a Member State and the United States, and will open the possibility of consultation in the event that constitutional principles or final judicial decisions binding upon a requested state may impede the fulfilment of an extradition.
This provision, combined with specific references in the recitals to individual rights, fair trial and an impartial tribunal, offers significant guarantees.
I would insist that Member States be bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and its protocols.
Nothing in these draft agreements should lead to decreased compliance with these international obligations.
It is also my deep conviction that the European Convention will conclude positively on the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future constitution, thus giving it a legally binding and constitutional status.
As regards Article 10 of the draft extradition agreement, and in particular the situation of an extradition request that conflicts with a European arrest warrant, a Member State confronted with such a situation of conflicting requests shall take into account a number of criteria in order to take a decision that widely corresponds to the lists of such competing requests already provided by the framework decision creating the European arrest warrant.
The designation of the competent authority is left to the requested Member State.
This can be a judicial authority unless the existing bilateral treaty between the Member State in question and the United States foresees an executive authority.
In addition, the final wording of the agreement drafted very recently at the last negotiation session has improved in the sense that it better underlines the fact that the framework decision on the European arrest warrant could be amended in the global context of further European Union integration.
This might in turn lead to the adaptation of the agreement with the United States in line with the natural evolution of the legislation on the European arrest warrant.
Finally, regarding data protection provisions, the relevant provision in the draft mutual legal assistance agreement with the United States is modelled on the two most recent European texts: the European Union's Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters of 2000 and the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the agreements under discussion today are important and positive, as already pointed out by both the Commissioner and Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, who has produced an excellent report on this matter on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
As has already been mentioned, this is the first time that extradition and legal cooperation agreements have been concluded between the European Union and a third country.
Closer cooperation between the United States and the European Union is also to be welcomed, since this will make the fight against international crime more effective, as well as providing appropriate protection for our democratic societies, our common values and our citizens.
I add my voice to those critical of the secrecy surrounding the negotiations, and of the Council's attempt to classify the text of the agreements as confidential, thus excluding Parliament.
This attitude is incomprehensible, since we are dealing with something which is going to have a direct impact on the fundamental rights of our citizens.
Fortunately, the Council reconsidered this absurd and unacceptable classification.
Overall, we support the two agreements before us, but there are certain aspects which it is essential to safeguard.
Firstly, the treatment received by the United States in relation to the European arrest warrant must never be the same as the treatment given to Member States of the European Union, since the US is subject neither to Community law, nor to the Convention on Human Rights, nor even to European data protection legislation.
Secondly, any request for execution of a European arrest warrant or for attendance at the International Criminal Court should take precedence over requests for extradition to the United States.
Thirdly, there should be a guarantee that extradition to the United States cannot take place if the defendant could be sentenced to death, or tried in exceptional or military tribunals.
Fourthly, there should be an explicit reference to Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as well as to the European Charter on Fundamental Rights.
Fifthly, a demand for effective and proportionate data protection provisions, to guarantee, at the very least, the same level of protection as that provided by the Council of Europe Convention.
I hope the necessary guarantees will be made in these areas when the agreements are signed at the European Union-United States Summit on 25 June.
Mr President, this is indeed a significant agreement.
It is the first time the European Union has negotiated an agreement of this nature in its own right.
A precedent is being set. In my view therefore the concerns raised by the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs concerning the conduct of negotiations and approval of the agreement are entirely justified, and I support his views.
I believe Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar has done good work. I would also like to congratulate him on his presentation, on what he was explaining to us.
Regarding content, I think it would be very positive to come to an agreement with the United States. It is however impossible to disregard the differences between our two systems.
In particular, it is impossible to disregard the death penalty.
The reservation on extradition is therefore quite clear. I believe the situation concerning legal cooperation is less clear, and consequently find Article 9 inadequate.
I do not think it is reasonable either that a request submitted by a Member State should not take precedence over one submitted by a third country, as stated in Article 10. I also have problems regarding the United States position on the International Criminal Court.
The same is true of other European states. I believe the text of the agreement should make it clear that a request submitted by the International Criminal Court takes precedence over one submitted by a third country.
It would be ridiculous for this not to be the case when the European arrest warrant takes precedence even over a Member State's request.
Finally, I should like to revisit the issue of the political wisdom of signing the agreement without dealing with the situation in GuantÃ¡namo. I do not believe it would be wise to do so.
Accordingly, I shall support the view that signature should be conditional on finding a solution to a problem affecting many European citizens. We are actually unaware of how many of our citizens are being held in GuantÃ¡namo together with citizens of other countries around the world.
I find the situation quite unacceptable.
I very much hope that the Member States and Community institutions will really pull out all the stops. Habeas corpus really is a basic right.
It is enshrined in all the conventions. Politically, we simply cannot enter into a special agreement with a third country that continues to hold people in these conditions.
Mr President, it obviously makes sense to smooth out the difficulties involved in making two sets of legal systems work together to catch criminals and terrorists.
Often in the field of law enforcement and intelligence different agencies are jealous of their patches and prerogatives, reluctant to share information because knowledge is power, and bureaucratic requirements must be examined critically.
However, it is another matter altogether to justify brushing aside legal safeguards, defendants' rights and privacy concerns in the name of the war against terrorism.
We have objections to these agreements on grounds of both procedure and content.
As others have said, the degree of unwarranted secrecy imposed by the Council has been utterly scandalous.
I am sorry to see that the Council is not here today.
No adequate explanation has been given.
The only possible explanation is the wish to avoid accountability to Parliament.
The failure to consult the European Parliament formerly is a disgrace, and the justification for this democratic deficit - that the agreements fall under foreign rather than justice policy - is thin in the extreme.
I very much hope the new EU Constitution will stop this ever happening again because we will have future agreements of this kind.
I wish the European public could understand - and one day they will - that the real threat to their rights comes not from this Parliament or the Commission - the Community institutions - but from the arrogant, executive powers wielded in intergovernmental cabal by the Council.
I just hope Commissioner Vitorino is right that the preamble and the text will ensure that no extradited European citizen or resident will face the death penalty, and that no European will end up in GuantÃ¡namo Bay without charge or without trial or will face a military tribunal which has the power to impose a death penalty without appeal.
I also hope time will prove that the Member States' obligations to the International Court are not compromised, because otherwise there really will be outrage in the European public. We must solve the disgrace of Europeans in GuantÃ¡namo Bay before ratifying this agreement.
I do not have the confidence in the Council that I have in Commissioner Vitorino.
I am sorry the Council is not here today to hear our objections.
Mr President, my group has grave concerns about the agreement that the Council wishes to conclude with the United States.
Problems arising as a result of greater police and judicial cooperation are being glossed over for political reasons.
Greater cooperation does of course enable us to catch wrongdoers more effectively, and that is a good thing.
However, this cooperation has to be subject to strict conditions regarding the rights of suspects, because, otherwise, people's trust in the authorities is undermined.
We must make sure that we do not shoot great holes in our rule of law in order to please the Wild West.
My concerns regarding the legal system of the United States extend beyond excrescences such as the death penalty and GuantÃ¡namo Bay. My concerns go to the heart of the US system.
Upwards of 92% of all convictions are based on plea bargains.
This means that, in more than 92% of cases, evidence is not examined, but, rather, punishments are negotiated with suspects driven by the fear of absurdly severe sentences.
That is not a fair process, and indeed I welcome the reference in the resolution to the European Convention on Human Rights, because that prescribes a fair process.
Another positive aspect of the report by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar is that it emphasises that there are alternatives to the extradition of European nationals to the United States, particularly with regard to crimes committed on European soil.
The United States just passes the evidence against a suspect on to the competent EU Member State, then we can try our citizens according to our own traditions, with our own guarantees, and people can serve their time close to home.
That is what I would call a testament to constructive cooperation between equal partners.
Mr President, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar's report is full of good intentions and we will no doubt approve it. It also, however, suffers from a most curious naivety.
How can we conclude legal agreements - or even discuss the law - with a state, the United States, which has no concept of or respect for the law, for the very notion of the law?
How can we contemplate extraditing our nationals to a country, a state, which does not obey the same legal conventions as us, or does so less and less?
That is the question asked by this report.
For, in the final analysis, we are negotiating with a state which enforces the death penalty, and to which we are thinking of extraditing our nationals; a state which does not respect fundamental human rights, particularly in relation to anti-terrorist legislation; a state which submits ever more cases to its military tribunals, so that we may perhaps see our own nationals judged by a US military tribunal; a state whose personal data transfer legislation is in flagrant contravention of our laws. Ultimately, we might ask ourselves, in view of all this, why we pass laws on these matters, and on many more besides, if we are then to put ourselves into the hands of a state which deliberately breaks those laws.
Lastly and most importantly, this state behaves like an ancient tribe, kidnapping our nationals, imprisoning them without even taking the trouble to charge them (I am thinking, of course, of GuantÃ¡namo Bay, but I believe there are other examples) and even, in all probability, indulging in a few acts of torture, sadly far from the prying eyes of any journalists.
In fact, the state in question does not respect the law, and, in my opinion, we do not have to honour any legal ties, or at any rate judicial or penal ones, with it.
I doubt, however, that the European Union will be capable of taking a firm stand, since it has sprung this trap with its own hands and behaves towards the US with a type of passivity which will sooner or later end up by leading us into ruinous situations.
I might add that we are seeing the first signs of some examples of this.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate our chairman, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, on the contortions he has had to perform in order to bring this text to plenary.
It has not been an easy task.
If we are to understand the importance and, above all, the scope of the agreement, we must remember what prompted this initiative. It was not the emotion immediately after September 11 so much as the urgent need, following those tragic events, to create a network to monitor and combat the terrorist organisations operating throughout the world.
To quote the resolution adopted by Parliament in December 2001, any agreement on judicial and police cooperation signed by the European Union must respect the Convention on Human Rights.
The primary concern - as has already been said - is not to permit the extradition of prisoners who would be liable to face the death penalty in the United States.
Now, without prejudice to this principle, I cannot see what other concerns there might be.
We feel it would be excessive in any case to presume to make the implementation of this agreement conditional upon an undertaking to do something about the situation at the GuantÃ¡namo base.
We can demand clarity and transparency from the United States with regard to what is happening at that base, but we must not hinder the progress of an agreement whose effect is much wider than that, which is, in other words, in the interests of world security, not just US security.
That is why we voted against the amendment on GuantÃ¡namo in committee, seeing it as a separate issue which can, if necessary, be addressed on its own.
As for accusing the United States of being a country which fails to respect human rights, all I can say is I would not want to be the council for the prosecution. We must remember that the United States was the first genuine democracy to be created in the world in the history of civilisation.
My opinion is that some views are to be considered to be decidedly partisan.
The agreement is a major step forward in combating not just terrorism but financial crime, the drug trafficking multinationals, money laundering, cyber crime and the trafficking of human beings too.
These may appear to be unrelated issues, but they are, in actual fact, linked by the urgent need for resolute, timely, unconditional action.
Mr President, there are three fundamental questions to be answered: does this agreement make the fight against crime any more effective, will it strengthen the European Judicial Area, and is there any added value with regard to guarantees for the accused?


These questions cannot yet be answered in the affirmative, in my opinion.
That is partly due to the procedure followed.
Commissioner Vitorino said that this is the first Union agreement.
It is a milestone, but milestones require a different procedure.
Back-room discussions, confidential documents and a lack of appreciation of the European Parliament and the national parliaments - that is not the stuff milestones are made of.
The fault for this lies entirely with Europe.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council deserves to be graded an emphatic 'unsatisfactory'.
It beggars belief that here in Europe we have to fight for fundamental democratic rights such as parliamentary scrutiny.
The subject matter of the agreement also raises a lot of questions.
In itself there is nothing unusual about this, but, that being the case, one has to be able to discuss them.
For example, who ultimately takes the decision on extradition: the judges or the Ministries of Foreign Affairs?
Who is extradited?
How do we deal with the system of plea bargains?
Mrs Buitenweg went into detail about that.
For example, an in-depth analysis of the impact of the recent Homeland Security Act on data provided by the Union or its agencies is lacking.
There is a risk of undermining the International Criminal Court.
There is still no clarity as regards legal aid or the use of data for other purposes.
Then there is the point about GuantÃ¡namo.
Various speakers - Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in particular - have spoken wise words on this subject.
Something really has to be done about this.
In short, this is an agreement that cannot just be rushed through.
The Council started in plenty of time, but has systematically had its back turned to both the national parliaments and the European Parliament, in contrast to the United States, which at least still consults its Congress.
Is this a milestone, then?
Not yet.
The agreements between the United States and the EU are, of course, really about integrating the EU countries' and the United States's criminal law and rules of criminal procedure or, at any rate, essential aspects of these.
The agreements should provoke protests from any serious politician specialising in the law.
These agreements represent the current low point in the development of the EU's legal policy.
In the Nordic countries, specialists in the field thought that the low point had been reached with the two framework decisions concerning the European arrest warrant and measures for combating terrorism, but matters are now still worse.
Note that the only professional investigation implemented by the institutions of the EU concerning these crucial issues of legal policy are open to serious criticism on the grounds of principle due to the fact that, in the context of the rights that are a crucial part of our democratic basis of values, the EU's acts violate a range of basic principles in the fields of criminal law and procedure.
We are concerned here with what is termed the EU network of independent experts in basic rights which, on 31 March of this year, issued a comprehensive report on, as they put it, the balance between freedom and security.
Has anyone within the EU system attended to the criticism by the group of experts that the acts compromise legal certainty?
Definitely not.
As I say, these agreements make matters still worse.
The EU system and the Member States will now, in the first place, accept the extradition of citizens of the Member States for criminal prosecution and imprisonment in the United States, which is a banana republic in terms of legal policy.
Quite a few speakers have referred to the scandal in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, where EU citizens are being detained and mistreated under circumstances that decisively violate international law and basic legal principles.
It is incomprehensible that an agreement can be entered into with a juridico-political banana republic.
The American investigation services will, moreover, subsequently be permitted to operate within the Member States.
A year's secret negotiations were conducted in advance and, as the Council put it, protecting the Council's negotiations was a more important interest than democratic scrutiny.
Can we sink any deeper?
I also refer to the minority opinion on the report, which I have been a party to issuing on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
Mr President, Commissioner, I regret that the Council is not present, because the Council is the one that does the negotiating, and it could at least listen to what Parliament has to say.
Clearly there is reason to go on the offensive against internationally organised terrorism and internationally organised crime by means of cooperation.
However, the question facing this Parliament at this moment is: have the conditions under which this cooperation is to take place been satisfactorily fulfilled?
I think that Parliament - through the voices of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, and very large numbers of fellow Members - has indicated the minimum conditions which are required by Parliament and which really must be fulfilled.
For example, there must be no cooperation with exceptional or military courts, and no extradition if this could lead to the death penalty.
Parliaments must be consulted on the procedure for concluding the agreement and regarding the scrutiny of its implementation.
I have heard quite a few questions, and I concur fully with these, for example regarding the unilateralism which is displayed by the United States in its foreign policy and which may result in extraditions, too, displaying a unilateral aspect, and in European countries having very little to expect in return.
Mr President, the HernÃ¡ndez Mollar report provides an excellent commentary on the content of the extradition and readmission agreements between the US and the EU.
The report rightly supports the two agreements, but the tone of the resolution with regard to the United States is too critical.
It is true that the legal systems of the EU Member States and the US are different, but the US, too, is a democratic nation that safeguards human rights.
The sense of moral superiority exuded by the resolution and this debate, too, is therefore inappropriate.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about democratic scrutiny, another target of criticism in the resolution.
The agreements have to be approved by all the national parliaments before they can be ratified.
If, say, their content contravenes the existing bilateral treaties between individual Member States and the US or the human rights conventions, I am confident that the national parliaments will be capable of exercising their democratic rights.
There certainly will be scrutiny, therefore.
Mr President, the present text of the resolution leaves nothing to be desired as regards clarity.
The European Parliament's message is: the draft agreements must not be concluded unless the Council removes some fundamental objections on the part of Parliament.
I continue to hope that the Presidency will duly take these objections into account, as, after all, it is obliged to do on the basis of the European Convention.
It is the first time that the EU as such is concluding an agreement with a third country regarding judicial cooperation in criminal matters, but it is setting a bad example.
In future, the Council should involve the elected representative bodies of the Member States and the European Parliament in the negotiations at an earlier stage.
The texts of the draft agreements have been kept secret for too long.
That is inadmissible, especially as fundamental civil rights seem to be squandered under the pretext of the United States's fight against crime.
Stating this fact has nothing to do with a sense of moral superiority or anti-American sentiment.
The administration of justice in the United States does not provide sufficient guarantees for the rights of suspects.
The negotiated procedures common in criminal proceedings mean that it is not precluded that suspects may be convicted although innocent, or convicted on insufficient evidence.
This situation is exacerbated by the new legislation and practices in the United States since 11 September.
If the European Union wishes to take its own legal protection seriously, it must only conclude the two agreements with the United States once the guarantees called for by the vast majority in Parliament have been incorporated into them.

The Council has to redo its homework, and it is an illustration of the weakness of the democratic system in Europe that the Council has up to now been able to take the liberty of ignoring the views of the elected representative body - but of course we are not stupid.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although these agreements on judicial and police cooperation are extremely important, our values must still be respected.
I would like to ask two questions.
Given that the death penalty still exists in the USA, even if we conclude an agreement that would prevent it from being carried out, the problem remains: the death penalty is counter to our values.
Given that, if crimes are committed, there is a hierarchy between US citizens, who cannot be tried before the International Criminal Court, and European citizens, who can be extradited to the USA in order to be tried before the US judiciary, such discrimination is also counter to our principles.
The case of the GuantÃ¡namo Bay prisoners is the most flagrant illustration of the fact that the USA does not respect fundamental rights, insofar as it has brought these men before special courts and completely violated their right to defence.
They are suffering degrading, inhumane treatment, counter to international law and to the universal declaration of human rights.
In these conditions, do you truly think it possible for the Union to accept extradition to the USA of any individual, regardless of their nationality?
In conclusion, what guarantees do we have that the USA will in fact respect an agreement signed with the Union, when it does not respect its international obligations, ignores international law, and considers itself above the law and entitled to take unilateral decisions as shown in its attack on Iraq?
Mr President, the events of 11 September were tragic and deeply unforgivable.
No one wishes to see them repeated, but it would be almost as tragic to see them exploited for the purposes of violating fundamental human rights and guarantees of legal certainty by which, as EU citizens, we are normally protected.
As the minority opinion rightly points out, the agreements between the EU and the United States do not merely contain dubious measures for combating terrorism; the agreements are a slippery slope towards extradition and legal cooperation on criminal matters generally.
According to the agreements, European citizens who are alleged to have committed a crime carrying a sentence of at least one year may be extradited to the United States - a country that, as many have pointed out, practises the death penalty.
In no way can I support the thinking behind these international agreements, and I am therefore voting against the report, but I should like to call for support for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
Mr President, I wish to say that it is indeed infuriating that the Council is absent from a debate such as this, especially when the European Parliament had already given the Council advance warning during the previous Plenary.
It would be good if the Commission and the Council were to pay attention when the European Parliament gives advance warning, especially on such important issues.
Perhaps the Council's only justification for not being here would be if its President-in-Office were locked away somewhere reading the Amnesty International report for 2003, which tells us that the big threat to rights today are the measures being taken by the United States at global level on the pretext of 11 September in the aim of undermining and withdrawing citizens' democratic and other rights.
The case we are examining now in connection with the agreements on judicial cooperation and extradition is an export from the United States of restrictions on rights, notably on the question of the death penalty.
The United States are exporting them to us and we, with no shame whatsoever and, unfortunately, with a Greek Presidency, are importing them under these agreements.
I should like to ask Commissioner Vitorino to give us his opinion.
Commissioner, as long as you are here and are not yet Secretary General of ????, why in your opinion in Article 13, which refers to the question of a request for a person who may face the death penalty to be extradited, does the agreement read: 'the request for extradition may be denied' by the European Union to the United States of America rather than ' will be denied'?
Why?
Please explain it to us in terms we can understand.
.
Mr President, in this debate the Commission acted like an amicus curiae because it was not the negotiator, it assisted the successive Council presidencies in their negotiations.
Therefore, I will just try to clarify some of the points raised and give the Commission's opinion on those points.
I shall begin with Article 13.
I shall try to make myself clear.
The US-EU agreement is a bilateral agreement that regulates the relationship between the European Union and the United States of America.
It does not regulate the relationship between the Member States of the European Union among themselves or the obligations that Member States have under other international legal instruments.
All the Member States have subscribed to the European Convention on Human Rights and to the specific protocol that forbids the death penalty.
This means that, acting in accordance with their international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, Member States will refuse extradition where the death penalty is concerned.
That does not derive from an obligation between the European Union and the United States of America. It derives directly from the obligation of the Member States to be in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, with the protocol and, I hope, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union that will have constitutional status and be legally binding after its inclusion in the new Constitutional Treaty.
When it comes to the International Criminal Court, I would draw your attention to the fact that Article 10 of the agreement does not apply to the International Criminal Court because that court is not a state and Article 10 only regulates the criteria to be used when there is simultaneously, in regard to a same person, a conflicting request by a third state - like the United States of America - and by a European Union Member State.
It does not deal with requests from the International Criminal Court.
Therefore, nothing prevents the Member States from deciding what they want to do as far as a request from the International Criminal Court is concerned, irrespective of any bilateral agreement with the United States of America.
When it comes to the European arrest warrant as such, I can even agree with Parliament.
However, unfortunately, the Council did not adopt the Commission's proposal on the primacy of the European arrest warrant.
Therein lies the problem.
We are not talking today about a fully comprehensive primacy of the European arrest warrant over any other request for extradition.
It does not exist.
The framework decision on the European arrest warrant already recognises that when there is a demand under a European arrest warrant and a simultaneous demand for extradition by a third country, there are a number of criteria that will have to be taken into consideration in order to decide which demand has primacy.
So we are not changing the legal system of the European Union.
The Commission regrets that this primacy was not recognised in the past when the Council adopted the European arrest warrant.
However, today this primacy does not exist and therefore cannot be affected by the terms of a bilateral agreement with the United States.
What we were careful to say was that the possibility of recognising in the future the primacy of the European arrest warrant could not be undermined or limited by this kind of bilateral agreement.
There is a specific provision on the revision of this kind of bilateral agreement with the United States in case we decide to recognise the primacy of the European arrest warrant in the future.
I hope that sooner or later we will do that.
Finally, on the matter of special courts.
It must be said that the key issue for me - and I have always said this to Parliament - is not the nature of the court, it is not the question of special courts as such - even some Member States have special courts in the European Union.
The question is one of due and fair process and guarantees, so that extradition is only granted where there are guarantees that the requesting Member State will follow a due and fair process.
There are two recitals in the agreements that address this issue.
The first one concerns due regard for the rights of individuals and the rule of law; the second one concerns the guarantees and the respective legal systems which provide for the right to a fair trial of an extradited person.

Above all, there is Article 16a on non-derogation, which in paragraph 1 maintains all grounds for refusal relating to a matter not governed by this agreement available under a bilateral extradition treaty in force and which in paragraph 2 calls for consultation where the constitutional principles of the requested state may pose impediments to the fulfilment of its obligation to extradite.
In my interpretation, everything that might be considered as a demand for extradition to a court where the rule of due process is not respected can give leverage to the application of this Article 16a on non-derogation.
Finally, I sincerely hope that in the future Constitution we will have specific provisions not only on consultation of Parliament concerning these kinds of agreements, which will become more frequent in the future, but also concerning the competence of the European Court of Justice to guarantee the full compliance of these agreements with the future Constitution of the European Union.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0137/2003) by Mrs Roure on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal from the Commission with regard to the adoption of a Council directive (COM(2002) 548 C5-0502/2002 2002/0242(CNS)) on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of study, vocational training or voluntary service.
Before we embark on the debate, I would like to ask you all to keep strictly to your speaking time, or otherwise we will have difficulties when it comes to the votes.
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin, first of all, by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Roure, for the work she has done, and by thanking her for the admirable spirit of cooperation she has shown in preparing this important report.
With this text, which complements the other three proposals, on family reunification, economic immigration, and the status of long-term residents, the Commission brings to a close the legislative work aimed at laying the foundations of a joint legal immigration policy, since we have decided not to table a proposal designed to cover all individuals not included under the previous proposals.
I welcome the fact that Parliament has responded to the Commission by adopting this report so quickly.
This proposal targets migration by third-country nationals for the purpose of studies.
This is a special type of immigration to the extent that it is temporary and lasts no longer, in principle, than the educational course itself. It also brings reciprocal benefits for both the countries of origin and the host countries, not to mention, of course, the migrants themselves, who profit directly from it.
This proposal integrates immigration policy but should also be viewed in the context of Community action in the field of education.
Clearly, our aim is to promote migration for educational purposes, above all by accepting the greatest possible number of third-country students into higher education.
The proposal for a directive was devised in this spirit.
The entry conditions anticipated in it were rendered as objective as possible, in order to guarantee the quick and easy processing of applications. They are also phrased clearly and thoroughly so that the Member States can combat attempts to abuse them.
This is also, I believe, an innovative proposal which fits into the context of the growing internationalisation of education, especially the recognition of students' right to move to another Member State to continue their studies, after previously being admitted into a first European Union Member State.
The proposal also covers the vocational training sector, setting entry conditions for unremunerated trainees such as those who come to take up a placement with a company.
It is thus designed to complement the proposal for a directive on the admission of workers that covers remunerated traineeships.
Following meetings held with non-governmental organisations, provisions on secondary school pupils and volunteers arriving in the European Community were introduced into our proposal.
The aim is to facilitate exchange programmes for secondary school pupils.
Encouraging the discovery of culture by pupils who will later be tempted to return as higher education students will reap enormous benefits for the Community.
In addition, a provision regulating the admission of volunteers was added to the proposal, protecting such individuals from a potential legal loophole.
It must be obvious that the Commission did not lose sight of public security considerations.
The proposal contains a public order and security clause providing Member States with enough room to manoeuvre for them to take precautions against the terrorist threat, in particular.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction to my speech, I would like to thank most sincerely all the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups.
Thanks to the work we have carried out together, we can send a strong signal in this highly sensitive field.
I would also thank the Commission for its support, which was particularly welcome.
It is vital that our countries offer an appropriate welcome to foreign students, just as it is vital to have a common policy on this welcome.
In this way we can contribute in a positive manner to the training of future executives in third countries and increase cooperation with these countries in terms of education in order to meet the challenge of the internationalisation of teaching.
This proposal for a directive would make it possible to achieve significant progress that we can all support.
We would point out that a legal basis has at last been provided for volunteers.
We would also point out that this instrument might enable us to catch up with the United States, where residential study programmes are broadly encouraged and facilitated.
We are entering into a strategy that aims to increase cooperation with third countries in terms of teaching as set out, for example, in the Erasmus World programme.
The votes in committee allowed a few clarifications to be made and I shall now cite some of these.
We would call for the introduction into the directive of researchers, who are no longer students but do not carry out paid work.
We would also emphasise that we wanted to contribute to the fight against brain drain from South to North.
Receiving third-country nationals for study purposes must not lead to an increase in brain drain from these countries.
We would similarly like to see an improvement in procedural guarantees and we therefore propose reducing the deadline for notifying applicants of decisions on applications for admission or renewal from 90 days to 60 days.
We also propose greater flexibility concerning the student residence permit.
Where the study programme is shorter than one year but longer than nine months, like many programmes, it would be a shame not to grant a one-year residence permit to enable students to work during the holidays preceding or following the study programme in order to earn some of the money required for their stay, or to improve their knowledge of their host country for a few weeks.
The proposal for a directive grants students and unpaid researchers the possibility of working for a maximum of 10 to 20 hours per week.
This right is essential in order to allow third-country nationals to boost their income in order to live decently.
Furthermore, with regard to unpaid researchers, I believe it is very important for trade union representatives to be informed of their specific situation in order to be able to monitor compliance with the provisions of the directive.
Withholding the right to work in the first year of residence or withdrawing the right to work if students do not make sufficient progress in their studies is unjustifiable and would tend to encourage illegal employment and exploitation of these nationals.
Where there is insufficient progress in studies, attested to by the teaching establishment, the Member State could possibly have the option of reducing the number of working hours so that the student could devote more time to their studies.
That is why I believe the amendment tabled to that effect to be satisfactory.
We have the concerns of some Member States about the possible effects of the right to mobility and the right to work granted to students.
I understand these concerns, but the proposal for a directive itself contains responses to this, in particular with regard to the mobility of students, which is very clearly defined, with specific conditions, in Article 7.
Thus, the proposed directive does not apply to the mobility of students wishing to exchange student status for immigrant worker status.
This status, granted by a working residence permit, is the subject of the TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ report that we adopted in plenary last February.
A change in status from student to immigrant worker is of course possible, but is outside the scope of the directive in question.
We would point out that the Commission is simultaneously for an open policy with regard to the admission of students from third countries, in accordance with the wishes of the Member States, and for a policy of firmness with regard to persons or networks which voluntarily abuse the system.
I therefore believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we should seize the opportunity to send a strong message to the Council calling for it swiftly to reach an agreement on this important matter in order to ensure a welcome that is worthy of our Member States.

Mr President, I should first like to thank Mrs Roure, the rapporteur, for her hard work. In particular, I should like to pay tribute to the great effort she made to reach a consensus across the political groups.
As stated previously, this Commission initiative supplements others regulating immigration for reasons of employment, self-employment or otherwise. It also supplements the directive on family reunification.
In so doing it contributes to approximation of national legislation in this area, as recognised at the Tampere European Council.
Students enjoy ever-greater mobility. They are always on the go, and third-country student exchanges certainly contribute to our cultural enrichment.
It would therefore also be beneficial to promote exchange visits by European Union students to third countries, although this is not the aim of this directive.
It is undoubtedly beneficial for Europe if third-country students undertake part of their studies here.
Europe certainly gains, but it is also important to ensure those students receive the best training so that they will be able to make a useful contribution to the development of their countries of origin.
Whenever there is discussion of immigration from developing countries it is always stated that promoting growth and development is the best way of combating illegal immigration. I therefore share the concern expressed by the rapporteur.
I believe the European Union must grant entry to immigrants wishing to study here. It is however essential for those students to return to their countries of origin on completion of their studies.
They should be able to put the knowledge they have acquired to good use.
We must not be party to creaming off the most able individuals from developing countries.
Turning to the entry requirements we are currently considering, namely specific requirements to regulate immigration for study purposes or for volunteering, we should take account of the circumstances of each Member State.
This is stated in the Commission's proposal. A monitoring system is called for, to help combat illegal trafficking networks and exploitation in the workplace.
Consequently, I support the Commission's proposal to grant Member States authority to order the expulsion of a migrant for reasons of public order, or to refuse to renew a residence permit.
Immigration for study purposes needs to be regulated to prevent ghost centres from springing up. The latter could then set up illegal immigration networks.
It is important to ascertain that the higher education or vocational training institutions are legally recognised. In addition, these centres should be in a position to guarantee quality learning for the students.
In the case of apprentices, it is also important to ensure that they can gain practical experience in specialised centres or companies.
Care should be taken to ensure that entry permits for apprentices do not become a cover for illegal employment. The centres need to be properly equipped too.
Turning to residence permits, it is certainly appropriate to be able to renew a residence permit for student exchanges when all the conditions have been met. This would allow students to complete more than one academic year in the same institution.
The period of residence granted could even exceed the duration of the studies, though as Mrs Roure stated, a limit must nonetheless be set.
My group tabled an amendment providing for a period of residence of one year if the higher education course was of nine months' duration. That is the usual length of an academic year
In addition, safeguards or restrictions applying to students who fail to make satisfactory progress in their studies must also be put in place.
Failure to do so would amount to opening the floodgates to students whose sole intention was to come to work. There would be little incentive to make good progress on the courses of study.
My group has therefore also tabled an amendment allowing Member States to reduce the period in which students may work if they do not make satisfactory progress in their studies.
The rapporteur has included in the report a number of amendments aimed at ensuring that this directive covers third-country nationals who are unpaid researchers.
I am not opposed to the idea. It might however be appropriate to have a specific Commission initiative on the subject.
Nonetheless, it is certainly the case that unpaid research and vocational training could be dealt with in a similar way.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Roure for the work she has carried out, and to underline what Mr Oreja ArburÃºa has just said about ensuring that the measures we are about to approve benefit their intended targets and are not cynically exploited.
I would also like to remind you of the Lisbon strategy, approved at the European Council on 24 March 2000, in which the challenges facing the Union in the new knowledge-based economy were set out.
In that strategy, mention was already made of emerging teaching, research and training needs, which must not be confined within the Union's geographical borders.
At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that every one of these areas exerts a potential attraction all over the world, as befits Europe's extraordinary cultural and scientific heritage.
It is thus the responsibility of the European Union and the Member States to implement policies which attract third-country students.
We therefore welcome this proposal, which is another step towards approximating national legislation on admission and residence conditions for third-country nationals, the final goal being to create a comprehensive legal framework regulating admissions on the basis of the reasons for immigrants' visits.
The internationalisation of education and the increased mobility of students is in line with the aim of developing quality education, as laid out in Article 149 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. It helps in promoting inter-cultural understanding, energising European educational systems and attaining high-quality teaching standards.
For all these reasons, I think that the Commission's proposal is quite positive.
It constitutes a forward step in strengthening cooperation with third countries and in developing that quality education.
The admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, vocational training or voluntary service has the peculiar distinction of being temporary and independent of the host State's labour market.
Mr President, we are all agreed that never has so much been achieved to promote the future of Europe with so little money as through the Erasmus programme.
Offering young people from other states the opportunity to spend some of their formative years in Europe is something we should all be seeking to do, because we all stand to benefit from it.
I do however believe that establishing clear, specific and common standards is crucial to the success of these programmes. This will avoid subjecting students to difficult procedures that could also be humiliating.
The criteria for choosing a place to study or to undertake voluntary work should always be its appropriateness or excellence. The existence of entry or residence facilities should not influence the choice.
Clear rules and flexibility are certainly needed to allow a student to earn money legally in reasonable conditions for his or her stay.
Common principles are called for, such as the Commission's proposal. I believe this proposal is very helpful.
We recognise that reasonable restrictions are required. In particular, this is to ensure that the students return to their countries and put what they have learnt to good use.
They can also spread the new skills and approaches developed during such an experience. That is probably even more important.
It cannot and must not be achieved solely through strict regulations.
I venture to suggest to the Commission that this proposal should be included in future generous and ambitious actions involving the countries of origin of such students. There needs to be scope for mobility, for example, to maximise the benefits the Union can gain from hosting these individuals.
I trust no further difficulties or reasons will emerge that will prevent the Council from adopting the proposal on this occasion.
I have in mind a threat to the security of Europe, for instance.
The proposal needs to be fast-tracked through the Council.
Mrs Roure deserves to be congratulated on her work.
I commend this helpful report to the House and call for it to be endorsed by a substantial majority of Members.
Hopefully this will be achieved for once, and a precedent set.
Mr President, the proposals presented to us aim to encourage further the entry of immigrants into the European Union.
The most obvious example of this is the last report concerning the right to family reunification, the Fourtou report, in which the concept of family had become unrecognisable, such was the extent to which it had been extended and denatured.
In its frenzy to allow needy foreigners from all over the world into a Europe that it would like to be respectful of human rights and to have a humanist, not to say humanitarian, vocation, the Commission is planning the death of nations by drowning and suffocation.
It should be noted, however, that this report, even though it supplements the measures that have already been presented with regard to immigration for the purposes of employment and family reunification, does not take the same approach.
It concerns students and school pupils who would enter the Union in order to study.
In this regard, nonetheless, we need to establish the length of stay, methods of monitoring their studies, and procedures for non-renewal of the student residence permit.
This exchange and this form of cooperation between Europe and third countries is clearly a source of intellectual enrichment between students of the country of origin and the host country.
Should we not, however, devote our efforts more to aid to development in less advantaged countries, in order to allow these countries to train their elite at home and keep them there, in order to prevent brain drain, which, unfortunately for them, is often inevitable?
Of course, this would require a genuine cooperation policy with disadvantaged third countries and a sea change in immigration policy in Brussels.
Sadly, we are far from achieving this.
Mr President, this is a very timely report.
We know the importance of the entry of third-country nationals for temporary periods of study, which brings enormous benefits and advantages for the host country and the student alike.
The number of students undertaking such international exchanges is greater than ever and demand continues to grow.
This must be welcomed by all sides, apart from the previous speaker.
Indeed we need to put into place measures to ensure that the European Union continues to remain a centre of excellence in this field.
I congratulate the rapporteur on this report.
It sets a broad framework to encourage third-country nationals to enjoy the best educational facilities available in Member States without over-prescribing and over-regulating.
Common practices to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals can only be a good thing.
However, I am afraid certain elements of this proposal are problematic for my country, the United Kingdom.
Colleagues will be aware that the United Kingdom and the English language have a magnetic appeal for huge numbers of students, not just from European Union countries, but from all over the world.
Whilst this is welcomed and understandable, it creates special challenges, not least of which are the proposals here and how they affect the national minimum wage in the United Kingdom.
The national minimum wage is one of the greatest steps forward in the United Kingdom since 1997.
It requires employers not to take on third-country nationals unless they are paid at least the going rate for the job.
Unfortunately aspects of this report, referring to volunteers, undermine the minimum wage in the United Kingdom, which seeks to protect the rights of both migrants and nationals, ensuring that those engaged on a voluntary basis, without adequate conditions of service, are not there in place of a full- or part-time worker.
The concerns are specific to the United Kingdom.
In general the report is balanced and sensible.
I shall be voting for it in the hope that the UK will be joining later on, as in other cases.
Mr President, Commissioner, I shall adopt a technical approach, but please also allow me to make some more general comments.
The Europe of the future must become a land of exchange, of meetings and mixing.
What could be more important than knowing our neighbours, their culture and their language?
In any case, that is what we say every morning.
For fifty years, we have been building a multicultural Europe, not a one-sided Europe.
Our Europe, that melting pot of cultures, languages and people, is possible thanks to free movement and study programmes.
Furthermore, we would like to build a Europe based on knowledge and lifelong learning.
However, a knowledge-based Europe can only exist through exchanges, in particular exchanges with third countries.
As the Nobel Prize-winner Octavio Paz so rightly wrote, 'every culture is born of mixing, meeting and confrontation; quite the opposite, it is isolation that destroys civilisations'.
Thanks to Mrs Roure's excellent report, we have the privilege of enabling young people from all over the world to come to this old Europe of ours in order to learn a language, study, or hone and share their knowledge.
As Mrs Roure so clearly pointed out, knowledge-sharing is a source of enrichment both for immigrants and for countries of origin and host countries.
By allowing easier, more homogenous access for students, researchers and volunteers, we are also allowing Europe and our fellow citizens to enrich and share their knowledge and experiences.
We cannot, therefore, close our doors to all these people who wish to learn, share and understand.
All the conditions must be met in order to allow third-country nationals to come to Europe to train or hone their knowledge, because knowledge is the only thing that increases when shared.
. (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that we are late for the vote, and will therefore be very brief.
I want to thank Mrs Roure for her excellent report. I want to express the Commission's preference for not including rules for researchers in this directive, since Mr Busquin and I intend this autumn to present a general proposal on third-country researchers in the European Union.
The Commission will consider further the rapporteur's proposals on brain drain, the stand-still clause and on reducing the decision period from 90 to 60 days.
Finally, I would encourage Parliament to seek a broad consensus in favour of adopting Amendment No 37, on conditions of access to work.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Mr President, on a point of order, yesterday in order to come to Strasbourg I left my home at 6 a.m., flew to Dublin, flew to London, flew to Paris and flew to Strasbourg, arriving at 6 p.m.
My point is that Air France has cancelled direct flights from Britain to Strasbourg which means that it is now enormously difficult for Members from Britain or Ireland to come here unless they take the whole day to do so.
I could go to America and back in the same time!
For that reason the time has come for this Parliament to consider whether or not it can recreate direct access to Strasbourg.
If not, then it will have to relocate to a place where it can do so and be more efficient.
Mr Hume, personally, I very much appreciate your remarks because I come across the same problems myself.
To add insult to injury I was even stopped by the police for speeding on my way here this week.
As far as I am aware the Strasbourg authorities are currently looking into the matter.
I hope that it will be resolved before too long.
I believe that the more pressure that is brought to bear, the better the result will be.
Mr President, on a point of order, in relation to the point that has just been made I would like to thank President Cox on behalf of my group.
As soon as that suspension took place, he wrote on behalf of Parliament, having received representations in relation to this issue from the leaders of the three largest groups from the UK.
The work that is now being undertaken by the Strasbourg authorities, and also by the French authorities, has been prompted by the very swift action taken by the President.
My point, however, is that we are meeting on a day when there is a national air strike in France.
I look around the Chamber and see that many Members are absent.
Our democratic legitimacy, in terms of the votes that we take on important issues, is bound to be diminished if Members are prevented from participating in the democratic process because of action of that sort.
I ask you, therefore, to convey to the President a request from the House that an analysis be undertaken of attendance here in part-sessions, on the occasions when, with alarmingly increased frequency, industrial action has been taken, which has made our job as representatives of the people of Europe infinitely more difficult.
(Mixed reaction)
Mr Evans, that message will certainly be passed on to the President of Parliament.
I hope we can look at it within the Bureau.
Mr President, although I feel it is legitimate for Mr Hume to raise a practical issue, the need to improve air connections, and I support his request, I also find it shocking that a Member of Parliament should challenge the right to strike in the countries of the European Union.
I would point out that this case is not specific to France.
On 13 May, Austria experienced its first national strike in fifty years, on the same subject: pension protection. I welcome this.
If we want to remedy the mistrust that currently separates the European institutions from the citizens, therefore, we should not follow Mr Evans' bad example.
Quite the opposite, we should show solidarity with our fellow citizens.
Mr President, I should like to thank the House for rejecting this draft directive.
This is consistent with the House's rejection of an earlier draft directive that led to the one before us today.
Mr President, I must ask for an oral amendment to be made that has been negotiated and discussed with the political groups.
Instead of having the quantitative targets found in two of the clauses, that is to say instead of writing 50% etc, we just want to write 'significant reduction'.
This is noted also in the voting list.
Mr President, criticism has already been expressed this morning of the ways in which strikes are bringing life in France to a standstill.
Although, along with the criticism, there has also been sympathy, I do not comprehend how it is that strikes in France are a reason for this House's air conditioning not working.
All morning, it has been quite impossible to do any work in the offices on the side of the building facing the sun.
As far as the current temperature in the Chamber is concerned, the union probably would not allow work to be done under these conditions.
(Applause)
I will ensure that the college of Quaestors is aware of what you have mentioned.
Mr President, I would just like to clarify one point with regard to the voting list.
I would ask that we vote against the Committee's Amendments Nos 21 and 26 in order to be able to support the compromise amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Mr President, I just want to clarify something in the German text.
Rather than 'translated', it has to read, 'interpreted'.
The term has to be incorporated in all versions of the original Article 12.
Mr President, the adoption of Amendment No 6 makes it necessary to make a technical correction to Article 33 (1) and to Article 34 (1).
I take it as read that the plenary is happy that this technical correction should be made by the responsible Committee.
Mr President, my name has been added to Amendment No 23.
I did not sign that amendment and do not support it.
I shall therefore vote against it.
Mr President, I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur.
We now have a majority.
The House has been divided and different groups have had the opportunity to put on the record their preferred optimum solution amongst the options available.
I came to vote today with my colleagues in the ELDR.
I departed only once from that list: to show support for what was available.
Tomorrow, when we vote in the light of a Commission opinion, I would make the strongest appeal to Members of this House to give the largest possible consensus.
I understand that many people have deep reservations about aspects of what this final statute may contain.
However, I and the rapporteur will need to go to other institutions, and we have to go fortified by the weight of this House.
We can go with a 'yes' or we can go with a 'no', but there is no debate on the basis of 'yes, but...'.
I ask people to reflect overnight and when we come tomorrow to vote in the light of the Commission's opinion, to give to those charged to represent this House the widest, most thorough mandate possible to say: 'This is what is available; this what we bring forward; and this commands the support of a great majority of Parliament'.
That is my appeal - to reflect overnight and tomorrow to put our collective weight behind what is available, for that is what we shall work with.
.
(FR) The European Parliament has just rejected the proposal for a Council decision which aimed to establish practical measures for the application of the directive on mutual recognition between the Member States of decisions that each one might be led to take in order to expel third-country nationals.
Fortunately, this House was only consulted for an opinion, and this draft can therefore at last undergo the adoption procedure.
We feel that its content is entirely justified, and that Parliament is trying to start an unreasonable quarrel.
Most of the House maintained that Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty could not constitute a valid legal base: it does concern the adoption of common measures to repatriate illegal residents, but this provision would authorise measures concerning content rather than procedure.
This is a specious distinction, which even the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market could not support.
Here, in fact, Parliament is showing its normal pro-immigration bias: what it does not like about this draft is that it might facilitate the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
Of course, we did not support it.
.
(PT) Due to the need for consistency with the position previously adopted by the European Parliament in plenary session on 11 December 2000, when the French initiative - which lacked any legal basis - proposing the adoption of a directive on mutual recognition of decisions concerning expulsion of third-country nationals, was rejected, I do not feel able to adopt any other stance on this initiative than a similar rejection.
As was already the case with the Directive itself, the issue is not the proposal's substance or its actual political content, which in fact I consider quite positive, since it seeks to introduce rules and suitable practical methods for correcting any possible financial imbalances resulting from the implementation of the Directive in question.
In other words, the Member State responsible for the expulsion decision must reimburse the Member State which enforces that decision, on the basis of the real costs of the operation, up to a maximum level, which should be reasonable, comparable and balanced, and should cover transport, administration and accommodation.
Nevertheless, since we have before us an initiative on the application of Directive 2001/40/EC, which was rejected due to its lack of a legal basis, we are once again unable, by the same logic, to adopt any stance other than a rejection of this initiative.
.
(PT) I concur with the position of the rapporteur, who, while substantially in agreement with the proposal's content, advocated its rejection due to its legal basis.
Fundamentally, the draft directive does not in fact seek to establish substantive conditions for expulsion, but only deals with the mutual recognition of expulsion decisions already in force.
In other words, it does not specifically cover Community expulsion decisions on the basis of a rule adopted according to the terms of Article 63 of the European Community Treaty. Rather, it covers expulsion decisions taken on the basis of national law.
This directive, then, concerns the applicability of decisions; it does not define the substantive law on expulsion.
Article 63(3) of the EC Treaty, however, only provides for the latter and says nothing about the mutual recognition of decisions taken on the basis of national law.
.
(PT) I voted against this report, because I believe that it says nothing new. It simply synthesises a vision of Community law, in an obviously tendentious manner, and gives voice to expansionist desires which, though not new either, are no less surprising for the clarity with which they are declared.
In her argumentation, the rapporteur completely forgets the basic principle of Community legal intervention (whether from above or from below): the principle of subsidiarity.
In doing so, she provides national legal legislators with proof of their own subordination.
The rapporteur's vision is centralist rather than federalist.
She reduces national legislations and legal ordinances to an unacceptable level of subordination, in the belief that blanket application of Community law is the panacea which will solve all Europe's problems.
This is not to mention the subordinate role which the rapporteur unfortunately confers on national parliaments.
I am profoundly doubtful of the usefulness and benefits of this type of interpretation of the application of Community law. It merely serves to turn the application of the principle of subsidiarity on its head.
Mr President, last night, I dreamed that the Italian, French, German and Portuguese Ministers for Finance and the Finance Ministers of other countries said to me: 'You see, Mr Fatuzzo?
Mr Belder's report on macro-financial assistance provides for aid to be given to states which need money for their budgets.
Can it be a good thing to have a budget deficit, then?
Why do we not do the same here in Europe - we can reward those who have a deficit and launch an infringement procedure against the states which manage to balance their books?'
I put the question to the House.
. (PT) I supported this report, which reviews the logic hitherto underlying European Union Macro-financial Assistance (MFA) to third countries, with a view to proposing a more structured approach and, in particular, guaranteeing democratic legitimacy and a fundamental principle of accountability.
The fact is that we often know nothing about how MFA is handled once it is transferred directly into the budget of the beneficiary country's central bank.
Above and beyond that, moreover, given the exceptional character of MFA, it should be an occasional, short-term and one-off subsidy, in contrast to current practice in several beneficiary countries.
I also think that it would be a positive step to make MFA exceptional by definition, for example, and to transform it, through suitable inspection provisions, into a crisis prevention system.
Additionally, like the rapporteur, whose approach I warmly applaud, I think that the decision-making process, follow-up and assessment should be carried out with the greatest openness.
Mr President, I voted for Mr Schmid's report on employment but, as representative of the Pensioners' Party and all pensioners, I would stress before the House - which listens equally carefully to the explanations of vote of all the Members and, in particular, as we know and as we can see, to my own - that it is possible to both balance states' books and increase pensions if we can only manage to administer better the money handed over to the state by workers and citizens during their working lives which is to be restored to them subsequently when they grow old.
There is too much wastage, too many people interested in receiving money who do not deserve it.
If we put our finances in order we will be able to have lower taxes and duties, smaller contributions and larger pensions.
. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats support the proposal for the employment strategy.
It is important for the European Parliament to give its support to this strategy.
The proposal contains many positive features. For example, the aspects relating to equality are emphasised, improvements demanded for disabled people in the labour market and full employment declared to be an overarching objective.
A proposal by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is based on the view that a general reduction in taxes is beneficial to employment.
We do not share this view.
The facts show that there is no connection between tax levels and employment.
We choose, however, not to vote against this proposal, but to abstain.
The reason is that if the PPE-DE Group does not get this proposal through, that group will vote against the whole report.
If the whole report were to fall by the wayside, that would be far more serious than this individual proposal going through.
That is why we are abstaining on this point.
. I have voted for the Schmid report because I believe it supports and makes a contribution to the achievement of the three main goals of the 'European Employment Strategy', namely full employment, increased productivity and greater social inclusion within society of marginalised and disadvantaged groups.
I believe that the report's addition of a fourth goal, namely, mainstreaming of male-female equality is laudable.
The implementation of the guidelines on the 'open coordination method' is the correct way forward, as it involves national parliaments fully in the discussions and adoption of national employment plans.
This will make the report meaningful in constituencies like mine where unemployment is concentrated in small pockets of poverty in London despite the low unemployment nationally of the UK.
.
(EL) The spread of flexibility and atypical forms of work, in order to share out unemployment, entrepreneurship, the extension of working life on the pretext of the ageing of the population and sustainable pensions and lifelong learning are the basic Commission guidelines on employment.
At the same time, by making not only relative but also absolute cuts in wages and linking them to productivity, cutbacks in the welfare state and social protection and the non-application of what are inadequate safety regulations in the workplace are being promoted.
Unemployment is rising constantly and exceeds 10%, not counting hidden unemployment.
This situation, especially the large number of long-term unemployed and unemployment among the young and women, who are unable to enter the labour market, is giving rise to acute manifestations of poverty and social exclusion.
The term employment policy is completely misleading.
The proposed measures are essentially measures to reinforce the unaccountability of big business by granting it new privileges.
This policy represents an escalation of the attack on workers' rights, the objective being the further promotion of plans for a cheap workforce, with no employment, insurance, wage or trade union rights, and increased profits.
The workers are not only rejecting these measures, but are also reacting proactively and en masse against pro-monopoly choices by stepping up their fight.
. (SV) We believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions should be taken as close as possible to those they affect.
That is why we are actively pushing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone.
It must be perfectly clear to everyone that the EU must only deal with those issues it is best placed to tackle, namely cross-border issues.
All other issues should be dealt with at local, regional or national levels.
Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU should only have limited competence, except where freedom of movement for people within the EU is concerned.
Every Member State should have full responsibility for determining its own social security systems, together with the right to do so.
Health care, childcare and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas that are not directly cross-border.
The same applies to labour market policy.
That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere.
At the same time, we wish to emphasise that we fully share our fellow MEP's, Mr Schmid's, commitment to social cohesion, integration and, especially, equality.
.
(FR) Lifelong learning, work and the elderly are all highly important subjects that are highlighted in this report, and employment strategies are vital.
We want more jobs, but also better-adapted jobs.
The fight against poverty is key.
We cannot accept that families should still be living below the poverty line today.
It is a matter of solidarity.
The objectives we set must be accessible.
We need to invest in high-quality services so that women can reconcile employment with family obligations.
We need a more effective partnership between the Member States.
In order to foster the participation of women in social life and the labour market, we need to define a series of specific actions aiming to provide services that correspond to childcare needs, but which also enable us to provide assistance for families with other dependents.
It is essential to invest in public services in order to respond to the needs of families and society as a whole and it is vital for all the actors concerned to be involved in implementing employment strategy.
Furthermore, the existence of high-quality public services requires appropriate taxation.
. (FR) The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposes that we ratify the draft Council directive laying down a global employment policy for the European Union for completion by 2010.
This policy falls within the context of the Lisbon strategy which aims to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
The amendments made to this legislative resolution improve the initial text in certain aspects, in particular with regard to gender equality objectives and taking account of qualifications and vocational training.
The amendments, however, do not challenge the liberal idea of reducing company taxation and flexibility in the labour market.
What is even more important is that the resolution retains the objective of increasing the average age at retirement by five years at Community level by 2010, while millions of people are demonstrating in France and in other European countries against this idea and to protect their pension systems.
For this reason, I did not vote for the report.
. (PT) Whilst not playing down the significance of the report's more contentious aspects, I agree with the Commission's view, supported by the rapporteur, according to which this form of immigration is a source of mutual enrichment, both for the migrants directly concerned and for the country of origin and the host country.
It contributes to promoting intercultural understanding, to the dynamism of training in Europe and to the quest for high standards in education.
Information sharing and 'best practices' must become a reality beyond the Union's territory.
The training of students and researchers is a key sphere of action for increasing well-being, information and the quality of life, to which the Union is committed, in particular through the various association agreements and development funds.
In fact, because of the special contribution it makes to personal development, which will hopefully also benefit the countries of origin, this proposal should be carefully studied by the Member States in the context of their individual immigration policies.
What is particularly interesting is the Union's commitment to finding jobs for nationals in their country of origin and to regulating the system of voluntary work.
In the end, I voted in favour of this report, because Amendments Nos 36 and 37 have been adopted, adding considerable balance to the arrangements laid down in Articles 11(1) and 18(2)...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out, on behalf of all my colleagues in the French Socialist delegation and on my own behalf, our position on the report on the adoption of a Statute for Members.
The Statute needs to be adopted as a matter of urgency due to the imminent completion of the current enlargement process.
We are in favour of the principles underlying this step, even though we disagree with certain provisions concerning the sum and taxation of remuneration for Members.
The compensation system for Members did need to be rendered more comprehensible, but the text proposed does not seem to us to respond fully to this need.
That is why the French Socialist delegation wished to amend the text by voting for Amendment No 8 to Article 7 of the draft Statute, which it tabled alongside other political groups.
We feel that intelligent implementation of this principle means that remuneration would be adapted to different standards of living in the various Member States, even if certain inequalities would have to be corrected.
We are sorry that this amendment was not adopted.
In the current context, increasing remuneration for Members of the European Parliament would run the risk of causing an unfavourable reaction, at a time when the legitimacy of differences in remuneration between the economic and political elite and the rest of the population is in question.
When I woke up this morning, Mr President, I thought I was Mr Rothley and, on my way to Parliament in the car with which we are provided, I thought, 'I want to table an amendment to my report' - speaking as Mr Rothley - 'which gives Members of the European Parliament a salary which is twice as large as that paid to judges'.
When I got to Parliament, however, I looked in the mirror and saw that I was Mr Fatuzzo.
I had no hope of succeeding and so I had to resign myself to voting for the motion: it is better to be half a judge than to be a nobody.
Mr President, I would like, first of all, to ask you to take note of the following correction.
I actually wanted to vote in favour of Amendment No 8 to Article 16, rather than against it, as I am of course in favour of differential weighting of living expenses.
Now, by way of an actual explanation of how I voted, let me say that I have always been in favour of a Statute for Members of the European Parliament, but the reasons why I voted against the Rothley Report were as follows: I cannot understand why, today, we have not managed to make the actual costs of travel transparent and take them into account.
Before now, the Statute always had to serve as a pretext for such a rule not existing.
Now, we want a Statute, but we are rejecting transparency and the accounting for the real costs.
I find that dishonest; we cannot explain it to the public, who, when they travel on business, can of course claim only the actual costs.
Nor do I think it right that we have not substantially raised the pensionable age.
(Applause) In Germany, we have just had a debate on increasing the retirement age for people at large, and I think the same should obviously apply to us.
Apart from that, I am also in favour of us paying the same taxes as those who elected us, so as not to give the impression that we are establishing special rights for Members of this House.
That is why I had to go against my original intention and vote against the Statute.
I think that Parliament?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I can, fundamentally, do no other than agree with Mrs Breyer.
For years already, we have been wrestling with a solution to the issue of MEPs' salaries, and opinions can differ very widely, particularly when it comes to whether the current national system is preferable to one applicable right across the EU.
The one thing, though, that the creation of a new Statute must not do under any circumstances is to create privileges and new rules that cannot be got across to the public.
In view of the ongoing debate about how best to secure Europe's pension schemes, people will see the idea, contained in the Statute and in an amendment, of pensioning MEPs off as early as 60 or 63, as a provocation.
It is not only in my own country that people are, at present, being told that they will have to work for longer; in the European Parliament, on the other hand, the intention is obviously to guarantee politicians early retirement, which is not what social policy demands.
Neither can I, nor will I, vote for a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament in this form.
The same goes for the rule on lump sums for expenses.
In future, the reimbursement of expenses - of whatever kind - must relate only to those actually incurred, and it must no longer be possible to draw additional expenses under any circumstances.
It is imperative that rules for travel costs should be transparent and comprehensible.
Mr President, I want to offer an explanation of vote on behalf of the ELDR Group for our final vote on Mr Rothley's report on the Members' Statute on which we mainly abstained.
We have the greatest respect for President Cox, and this group, under his leadership, and subsequently, has always fought for reform.
We have been able to compromise on some matters but there are others of principle on which we will not compromise.
We, therefore, abstained on the following issues: we wanted reform now, not reform later at an uncertain date; we wanted equality for our colleagues from the acceding states.
If we want to be treated equally here ourselves, why should we offer them a worse deal?
We wanted the option of national tax so we could be treated with equality with the citizens we represent; we wanted a clear message that expenses should be transparent.
Those items did not find favour with the majority in this House.
Whilst Parliament has given its decision, it pains me as a parliamentarian to say that I hope the Council makes a better fist of it than we have.
. Members of the European Parliament are elected as representatives of the Member States and they should receive salaries and pay taxes similar to members of the national parliaments (MNP).
Attempts to differentiate between MEPs and MNPs will not strengthen any links between the two and extreme salary increases combined with EU taxation will alienate voters further.
We strongly support any efforts to make the remuneration and allowance system more transparent and in accordance with prudent accounting standards.
At the same time, we believe it is hypocritical to legislate on corporate governance while not being able to apply the same standards to an institution ultimately funded by taxpayers' money.
We have voted against the Rothley report as a consequence of the attempt to establish the idea of MEPs simply being 'European' and completely removed from their national settings as well as increase salaries substantially, but without a thorough 'cleaning-up' of the allowance system, cf. Article 27.
. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats wish to account for our reasons for voting against the draft decision in the report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
We cannot support the draft Statute, since our Amendment No 30 on national taxation has been rejected.
For ourselves as Swedish Social Democrats, it is extremely important for us to be able to retain national tax, since that is the system to which we adhere and of which we make use.
Joint funding via income tax is required for funding our common welfare policy.
We therefore believe that Members of the European Parliament should pay national tax in their own countries.
Elected political representatives should follow the same rules as everyone else.
Another key issue has been the way in which travel allowances are accounted for.
We have demanded that the new rules be based upon open accounts that are easily accessible to public scrutiny.
That is why we have worked for an open and fair system where allowances are concerned.
At present, travel and other expenses are paid out on a flat-rate basis.
We want to see a system in which refunds are made on the basis of actual costs.
We believe that salary levels too cause offence, since the new levels are very high.
.
(FR) Under the aegis of the new Article 190(5) of the EC Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Nice, this House has just drawn up a draft unified Statute for Members of the European Parliament, which should be submitted to the Council for its decision - no longer to be reached unanimously, but by a qualified majority.
The text addresses a number of technical issues that needed to be resolved in any case within the context of the recognised autonomy of the European Parliament to organise its correct internal functioning.
It also goes much further, however, by presenting a statute that standardises at European level all aspects of the situation of members of parliament and cuts essential links with their countries of origin, in particular remuneration.
As we have said a hundred times, Members of the European Parliament need to be paid - as they are today - by the citizens of their country, who elected them and whom they are supposed to represent.
Parliament's current actions correspond implicitly to the objective of establishing a super-State, where Members would represent the Union as a whole, rather than the country that elected them.
This is a fundamental, if surreptitious, change, of which, once again, our voters are unaware.
Out of honesty towards them, we refused to vote for this draft.
.
(NL) Mr President, I should like to make a couple of points by way of explanation of how I voted on the Members' Statute.
First of all, I believe that our salaries should be the same as the salaries of the members of the national parliaments.
I consider myself to be a Dutch politician, not a European official.
This is why I voted in favour of Amendment No 8 as well as Amendment No 5.
Secondly, I disagree with a net increase in our salary of at least EUR 2 800 per month.
This amount is set to increase even more if a decision is made in favour of imposing European taxes.
Such a substantial increase is unacceptable - especially since we hear it stressed on every side how necessary pay restraint is in order to maintain employment.
Taking advantage of the fact that, as a result of the Nice Treaty, the Council's decision on the 'Statute for Members of the European Parliament' must now be taken under qualified majority voting rather than unanimity, the EP is once again insisting on a proposal that contains aspects with which we disagree.
One such aspect concerns setting a monthly parliamentary allowance that is the same for all Members, regardless of which country they represent.
Members of the EP are elected in national constituencies.
Consequently, they are, and must remain, bound to these constituencies.
Establishing a single monthly allowance fits in with a federalist view of the mandate of an EP Member, by seeking to transform today's national Members of the EP into future 'European MPs'.
This is a vision that we do not share.
Furthermore, as we have emphasised, the social realities in the countries of the EU differ greatly, making it inevitable that if this measure is implemented, in various countries, including Portugal, there will be enormous inequalities and disparities between the pay of workers and that of representatives and holders of public office, which would be quite incomprehensible.
In other words, the salary of Members of the EP must be based on the salary of the Members of the national parliament of the country in which they are elected.
Hence our vote against the report.
.
(DE) One of the Statute's most controversial features is the amount of remuneration involved, and I welcome the agreement that we have been able to reach on this.
I have worked in the field of equal treatment for men and women for decades.
Our constant watchword was 'equal pay for equal work'.
Discrimination on the grounds of nationality is no more defensible than that on the grounds of gender.
Legally speaking, too, Article 12 of the EC Treaty prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of nationality.
Although the European Court of Justice has been consistent in adhering to this principle in its rulings, the fact that MEPs are a special case meant that it could not apply it here.
The amount of remuneration is a matter of dispute.
Comparing it with the present parliamentary salary, a Dane would regard 50% of a judge's salary as a lot of money, whilst others wonder why the work of an MEP is meant to be worth only half that of a judge.
Whatever the case may be, it is not the MEPs who determine what they are paid; it is the Council of Ministers that has to approve this proposal.
Moreover, this new regime will not apply until the next Parliament, that is, to our successors.
As regards the pension, I am amazed that the draft report proposed that it be payable from the completion of an MEP's sixtieth year.
(Explanation of vote cut short in accordance with Rule 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure).
.
(NL) The Statute for Members of the European Parliament has for years been the subject of two debates along completely opposite lines.
One, in which I have joined, is about the way in which we can call a halt to the financial privileges that cause the electorate to regard MEPs in a suspicious light.
The other is about the way in which membership of this House can be made more attractive by higher salaries, lower taxes and the highest level of Member protection against legal cases.
I have always been in favour of a uniform salary for all MEPs, provided that this salary is significantly lower than that in France, England and particularly Germany and Italy.
This uniform salary must remain subject to the national, regional and local taxes in the Member State of residence, as is the case for uniform salaries received by people working for international companies in different countries.
Guaranteeing the same net income by extremely low European taxes is a completely superfluous privilege for MEPs.
In addition, immunity must only protect freedom of speech of those elected and not lead to impunity in other matters.
The EU's enlargement must not affect political diversity.
The allocation of ever fewer seats in this House to each Member State prevents smaller movements from being represented.
Unlike some other Dutch people, I have only ever seen a statute as a means to an end, never the main aim.
Since the final document serves the opposite from what I have upheld, I am unable to give it my support.
. The EPLP is concerned about a number of points in the report as it currently stands: -
On tax we are of the view that Member States should be allowed to level tax at national rates.
On salaries the wise persons' report produced a formula that was acceptable to the majority of Member States and MEPs and we see no reason for the unjustified change to a salary which is 50% of that of a European Court Judge.
On expenses we firmly believe that the European Parliament has an opportunity to rectify the longstanding anomalies by introducing a system of travel at cost.
The report's stance on immunities would require changes to primary law and we feel that this is not the appropriate report in which this should be included.
Finally, on the question of the implementation date, the EPLP cannot accept under any circumstances a possible post 2004 implementation date.
The EPLP wants to go into the 2004 election campaign with this issue clearly resolved.
As the European Parliament has just voted for a date beyond that period we cannot support the final vote on this report.
.
(FR) At a time when the peoples of Europe are facing so many difficulties (unemployment, social breakdown, insecurity, etc.), I am not convinced that they will truly appreciate Parliament's determination to get its uniform statute for Members of the European Parliament adopted.
I believe it to be an entirely secondary concern and that it is being pursued for material and ideological reasons.
So far as the material aspect is concerned, there is no point in going on about it at length, but I think it is obscene to take advantage of the occasion to give MEPs a whole series of excessive sinecures and privileges.
Regarding the ideological aspect, no one is taken in: this statute's primary objective is to detach the elected representative from his State of origin completely.
Even though, in legal terms, we sit in this Parliament as the representatives of our respective peoples, they want to make us out to be the representatives of some mythical European people, in other words rootless.
It all follows on logically from Parliament's earlier vote in favour of a uniform electoral procedure, the principle of transnational constituencies or European political parties.
This report proves once again that Eurofederalism is divorced from the reality of the man in the street.
For years now, we have been wrestling with a solution to the issue of MEPs' salaries, and this is something on which opinions can differ. They certainly can when it comes to whether the current national system is preferable to one applicable right across the EU.
The one thing, though, that the creation of a new Statute must not do under any circumstances is to create privileges and new rules that cannot be got across to the public.
In view of the ongoing debate about how best to secure Europe's pension schemes, the popular view will be that the idea, contained in the Statute and in an amendment, of pensioning MEPs off as early as 60 or 63, is a provocation.
It is not only in my own country that people are, at the present time, being told that they will have to work for longer; in the European Parliament, on the other hand, the intention is obviously to guarantee politicians early retirement, which is not what social policy demands.
Neither can I, nor will I, vote for a Statute for the Members of the European Parliament in this form.
The same goes for the rule on lump sums for expenses. In future, the reimbursement of expenses - of whatever kind - must relate only to those actually incurred, and it must no longer be possible to draw additional expenses under any circumstances.
It is imperative that rules for travel costs should be transparent and comprehensible.
. (PT) The grounds for establishing a statute for Members of the European Parliament appear, at first sight, to be quite uncontroversial: to meet the need for equality amongst Members and to provide the public with greater transparency.
Such aims could be achieved, according to the rapporteur, by applying the same legal and financial arrangements to all Members, which would result in there being a single level of allowance and to this being subject to Community tax.
Adopting the Statute will, however, have significant consequences for the concept of the parliamentary mandate itself, specifically with regard to the nationals of the State in which those Members are elected - an aspect which only the rapporteur appears not to have fully understood.
A single European system would mean: subjecting Members to tax arrangements different to those applied to the citizens who voted for them; establishing Members as representatives of a hypothetical 'European people'; detracting from their standing as representatives of their own peoples, whereas they are genuine equals of the members of national parliaments, and disengaging them a little further from national and popular ties of belonging to a Member State.
Consequently, despite having voted in favour of some specific aspects, I have in the end voted against the report, because I wish once again to adopt a position of principle at a time when institutional reform, by autocratic methods, with the Convention at the very centre, appears to wish to develop in a very negative way and balance in the context ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Article 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (SV) We have today voted against the European Parliament's report on a new Statute for Members, which was however approved by 294 votes, with 171 against and 59 abstentions.
Without a system of travel allowances in which refunds are made on the basis of actual costs instead of, at present, on a flat-rate basis, the new Statute will not lead to increased openness.
Certainly, Parliament's Praesidium determined on 29 May 2003 to investigate a new system of travel allowances, but that still does not solve the problems.
A decision to refund actual costs should come into force automatically at the same time as a new Statute for Members is implemented.
In future, we should ideally like to see MEPs' salary levels set in relation to salary levels in the national parliaments.
Because MEPs live in, and represent, their Member States, tax should, in the future too, be deducted on a national basis in order to take account of the cost of living and of social insurance systems in different countries.
.
(FR) Since being elected to the European Parliament, I have heard a lot about the Members' Statute.
I believe Mr Rothley and the Committee on Legal Affairs as a whole have devoted a lot of time and energy to it, too much in my view since I have the impression that, as with the statute for European political parties, it is really about money.
These are not the great breakthroughs in democracy that will bring the European Union closer to the citizens.
What is in fact the point of these proposals, since they amend a text of higher legal status and will therefore remain inapplicable?
What is the point of this attempted standardisation that creates a rift between the elected representatives of the present 15 Member States, the new ones, the old ones, and those of the ten states that will be joining us in a year's time?
Many want a statute in order to improve an image tarnished by the abuses of a few.
Unfortunately, nothing in this statute can be considered a real improvement in transparency.
But offering the representatives of the peoples of the Member States a European system that differs from national law will further widen the gap we are wanting to bridge.
That is why I voted against this draft statute.
. (DE) I hereby declare that I have voted in favour of the Rothley report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, as I believe it to be essential that there should be, as soon as possible, a uniform statute with the same conditions applying to all Members of the European Parliament.
This also means that major differences between the salaries of Members from the different Member States are unacceptable.
In the European Parliament, as elsewhere, there must, in the medium term, be equal pay for equal work.
I am, moreover, of the opinion that salaries must, as a matter of urgency, be made transparent - it is not acceptable that MEPs should have to use the reimbursement of travel expenses as a way of topping up their incomes.
I will, nonetheless, not be availing myself of the rule's provisions.
I took my seat under the conditions that have prevailed to date, and I will, for my own part, continue to be subject to them.
Mr President, this morning, on my way to Parliament, I dreamed that I met the Prime Minister of Brazil, Mr InÃ¡cio Lula, who said to me: 'Mr Fatuzzo, this European Parliament is amazing, these regional free trade areas on which Mrs Mann has tabled a draft are amazing, and I urge you to vote for the motion.
The extension of this free trade process which you Europeans were the first to implement is so important for us and for the whole world that I dream of becoming the Romano Prodi of Mercursor.'
I immediately started to wonder whether Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, is really Romano Prodi or whether he is InÃ¡cio Lula pretending to be Mr Prodi?'
However, Mr President, as you know, it was a dream.
.
(FR) We voted against the Mann report because it calls for the complete 'communitisation' of the European Union's trade policy, which would be harmful, as I said in yesterday's debate.
But we also reject this report because of the trade strategy it advocates, which is in our view mistaken on at least two important points.
Firstly, it says quite clearly that the objective of opening up to international trade is world integration, including 'regulatory convergence'.
But while it is possible to support the idea of increasing trade to the benefit of all, it should also be added - which the report fails to do - that every country, or every region, has the right to protect its model of society.
Secondly, it is much too indulgent towards the European Union's trade policy, in particular its all-out adoption of free trade areas.
Such areas are useful if they reflect a desire for controlled opening.
But in reality Europe has so many of them and they overlap so much that no one knows what their real effects are and they are causing us to lose control over our trade relations.
.
(FR) A trade strategy reflects a particular view of the world: a pure liberalisation of trade exacerbating inequality or a fight for real development?
As the Mann report again shows, the chief aim of creating regional free trade areas (FTAs) is to ensure the EU has political and economic stability in its relations with the countries concerned (the 'strategic geo-political interests') so that nothing can get in the way of the sacrosanct free movement of goods, services and capital.
But what of peoples' access to basic rights?
What about an assessment of the social, environmental, cultural and economic consequences of such liberalisation?
What about genuine cooperation on equal terms and respecting the distinctive nature of each partner?
WTO rules must not be allowed to interfere with the EU's - still privileged - relations with its partners.
The EU cannot reduce its policy towards countries and whole regions to free trade areas alone; there is too much of that in the Mediterranean, for example, while what is urgently needed is real political dialogue and economic and social cooperation built without any concept of domination.
. (PT) The main aim of this report by the Committee on Industry is to use free trade areas (FTAs) and bilateral agreements as a 'Trojan horse' to ensure the liberalisation of world trade under the control of the WTO and the 'Doha Agenda', and perhaps even to exceed the ambitions of these by including political aims.
We read in the report that '...the constraint placed by the need to obtain consensus among WTO members complicates and slows down multilateral negotiations.
By moving faster than the global trading system and sharing its goals, FTAs serve as catalysts for change.
While FTAs undermine the non-discriminatory principle of multilateralism, as long as they are WTO-compliant and WTO-Plus, they are incentives and complementary models for new global trade initiatives...', putting the EU forward as a model to follow.
What is the point of these words?
The report also claims that the EU institutions should have exclusive competence 'for all areas of trade', and that 'QMV and co-decision should apply to all trade matters', which would clearly make it hard for Portugal to protect its national interests.
Hence my vote against the report.
. The subject of this report is an extremely important one.
That is why the Green/EFA Group was one of the instigators of an ITRE own-initiative report on the subject of regional integration, particularly with respect to its potential effects on multilateralism and on efforts to achieve sustainable development.
However, the final title and scope of this report was much less precise than we had anticipated, and its conclusions are at significant variance from our own.
Although some amendments that capture a number of our concerns were adopted, many others were not, and much of the report continues to give very uncritical support to ever greater economic integration.
One of our most important amendments would make the implementation of Free Trade Areas (FTAs) conditional on a prior in-depth sustainability impact assessment, to ensure that the FTA does not exacerbate inequalities among partners, and to establish mandatory rules to promote social justice and sustainability.
Since this - and amendments in a similar vein - were not adopted, we have been forced to abstain on this report.
. (PT) Recalling what could be called the 'relevance' of trade agreements concluded in recent years, the rapporteur emphasises that these are also driven by the desire to promote political stability, which consequently makes them an integral part of the Union's external policy.
Although the benefits of these free trade areas are undeniable, because the WTO has not clarified the situation, these areas are developing in a framework which lacks legal certainty.
Furthermore, we must bear in mind the potentially damaging consequences of a 'harmonising' strategy in the least-developed countries, whose ability to participate in trade negotiations is sometimes limited and cannot be overstretched, if we really want to see fair results.
Consequently, although I broadly agree, I feel that more prudent and gradualist guidelines needed to be defined and this is why I was inclining towards abstaining from the final vote.
The result of the vote on paragraph 21 of the proposal, however, has persuaded me to vote against the report.
In this field, which is so sensitive, it is crucial to uphold the decision-making procedure that was agreed on by consensus in Nice, as proposed in Amendment No 12.
By once again imposing the original wording, however, the majority is causing Parliament once again to persist with an approach that I believe to be unrealistic and unacceptable.
I therefore voted against the report.
.
(EL) The report on Euro-Mediterranean cooperation once again conceals the EU's arrogance towards the Mediterranean countries.
'Civilized' Europe is prepared to teach democracy and the free market to its 'uncivilised' neighbours.
It is becoming the appraiser of everything, especially when it comes to human rights, at a time when a huge network of dictatorship, repression and police states is unfolding in the EU itself.
It is disseminating its own version of terrorism, it is imposing special clauses in association agreements, while it has not a single word to say about Israeli state terrorism.
It is taking advantage of its economic supremacy not to assist in the development of the countries of north Africa and the Middle East, but to impose its terms on trade and on their internal affairs.
The report goes as far as to call on partner countries to implement policies for convergence with the euro, while pressing for the development of the private sector.
Despite pronouncements to the contrary, Euro-Mediterranean relations were and remain unequally priced.
They were and are a vehicle for intervention in the internal affairs of Mediterranean countries, in the aim of supporting the economic, military and political interests of the ?U. This policy will be stepped up given that, following enlargement, the ?U's attention is turning towards the Mediterranean.
In voting against the report, the Communist Party of Greece is expressing its support for the peoples and their fight, which is the only road to progress.
. (SV) We Swedish Moderates are in favour of the report on the annual report on the MEDA 2000 programme.
We believe however that, with its major problems in establishing a fixed budgetary framework, the EU cannot, in the current economic climate, take upon itself the increase in costs involved in this activity.
.
(FR) With Mr PiÃ©trasanta's report the European Parliament must express an opinion on the state of relations between Europe and its Mediterranean partners.
This report raises the fundamental questions underlying the partnership and gives pertinent answers which I support, in particular the need to stress the political dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership in order to foster democratisation and peace, support for Mediterranean civil societies, the systematic inclusion of the human rights issue in follow-up, and the establishment of a genuine Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly at the next EuroMed ministerial conference in Naples in December 2003.
I shall vote in favour of this report in order to give strong backing to the inclusion of these objectives in the MEDA programme.
But this programme alone is today insufficient to cover relations between the EU and its Mediterranean partners.
No additional resources have in fact been provided to this day (for 2003 the MEDA regional funding plan will have EUR 32 million and the 'Euro-Mediterranean investment and partnership facility' EUR 25 million), and the discrepancy between Europe's financial effort for the ten new members and its commitment to the Mediterranean is spectacular, not to say scandalous: EUR 185 of aid per capita for the East, half a euro per head for the Mediterranean.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated pursuant to Article 137 (1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) I voted for this excellent report.
As everyone knows, the main aim of MEDA, which, in 1995 simplified and combined a disparate series of instruments, is 'to reform economic and social structures and mitigate any social or environmental consequences which may result from economic development' in the Mediterranean basin, in three areas: 1. Strengthening political stability and democracy; 2.
Creating a free trade area; 3.
Attaching priority to the social and cultural spheres.
The MEDA programme has therefore become the main component of financial cooperation in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership (through non-refundable aid from the Commission or through other instruments coordinated with the EIB).
The results achieved by the MEDA I programme and the first two years of MEDA II, however, are such as to indicate that this model of cooperation should be continued and even stepped up (as the rapporteur suggests), substantially for the same reasons that led in 2000 to this successful programme being extended and relaunched for five more years, as the best possible means of achieving the aims of successive European Councils - Lisbon (1992), Corfu (1994) and Essen (1994): to enhance the EU's Mediterranean policy, to enable the Mediterranean Basin to become an area of cooperation guaranteeing peace, security ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(FR) The EU-USA agreements on judicial cooperation in criminal matters and extradition are entirely necessary, especially in the fight against terrorism.
However, they raise for the first time the question of the interpretation of Articles 38 and 24 of the EU Treaty, introduced by the Treaty of Nice, concerning the conclusion of international agreements by the European Union in the fields of the second and third pillars.
Those articles were drawn up and adopted with culpable negligence despite the warnings I gave in my counter-report on the Treaty of Nice.
We are seeing the consequences of that today: the national parliaments used to have the right to ratify such international agreements, but they have lost that right today and the European Parliament for its part has gained no equivalent right.
It is true that the States are now trying to find a national power of scrutiny by way of the 'constitutional reservation' that may enable them to go back to their national parliaments.
But that is far from being a perfect solution.
We see here the consequences of badly negotiated treaties.
The Convention on the future of Europe ought to correct that and bring the national parliaments back into play.
Unfortunately, it seems to want to go in the opposite direction.
. (PT) This is a matter of the utmost importance and one which should fundamentally fall within the competence of each individual country.
For this very reason, it is unacceptable that the Council should have declassified the text of the two draft agreements with the USA, only one month before these, the first agreements in this sphere between the EU and a third country, were due to be signed.
These agreements are all the more significant in political terms because they are being signed at a time when 'security' measures are being implemented that endanger citizens' rights, guarantees and freedoms and when the US is holding hundreds of people under arrest at its military base in GuantÃ¡namo, without having accused them or put them on trial, or when it demands that other States give it total immunity from the International Criminal Court.
The current wording of the agreements raises some fundamental issues, such as extradition to a country which still applies the death penalty and which has legislation that in the name of the 'war on terrorism', breaches fundamental rights; personal data protection, applied retroactively, and a lack of control, specifically of the so-called joint investigation teams.
Whilst criticising some aspects of the agreements' content, the EP's recommendation supports their broad thrust, and so we have voted against it.
Even the debate on this issue, just a few days after the criminal invasion of Iraq by the British and American forces, constitutes provocation.
Under this agreement, the ?U can hand the citizens of its Member States and their personal data over, with no strings attached, to the jurisdiction of the USA, the prosecuting authorities of which will do as they please far from any democratic control.
Joint EU/USA investigating teams will operate uncontrolled in the ?U, in violation of national constitutions and domestic law.
This is an agreement at the expense of the citizens of the Member States of the ?U. It does not result in any differentiation in the domestic law of the USA, such as the repeal of the death penalty or the discriminatory provisions in the 'patriotic law' which deny non-US citizens legal aid, changes to the legislation of states in the USA which are incompatible with European law, or an end to the inhumane detention of prisoners of war, including citizens of Member States of the EU in GuantÃ¡namo.
We call on our peoples to organise mass demonstrations against a dangerous agreement which, on the pretext of combating terrorism, will escalate prosecutions against the grass-roots, anti-imperialist movement by extraditing the fighters at its vanguard to the USA, together with anyone in general whom the USA considers suspicious; to prevent the legalisation of uncontrolled activities by the US prosecuting authorities in the ?U and to stop their governments from ratifying any such agreement.
.
(NL) In the past, countries did not extradite their own nationals.
These days, the EU functions as a single state, with a number of guarantees in place to prevent people from being punished for something that is allowed in their own countries.
Extraditions from the EU to other countries outside it go even further than that and are downright dangerous. This is certainly true for countries using a different penal system, such as the United States of America, where prisoners of war are locked up without any rights in camps that do not fall within the scope of American law and where the International Criminal Court is not recognised.
It is a matter of some importance to us Europeans that capital punishment exists over there and that innocent suspects first need to admit their guilt before they can negotiate a reduction of their sentences.
People living in Europe need to be protected from being subjected to that American system.
Anyone who does not travel to that country of their own free will and on their own initiative must have the guarantee that nobody forces them to go there.
This is why I reject the draft agreement on extradition and judicial cooperation, discussed in the Justice and Internal Affairs Council on 8 May.
I support the rapporteur's attempts to at least take a stand against military courts of justice, against what is going on at GuantÃ¡namo, and against discrimination against European citizens, and I fully share his view that any future change to this agreement should not be made outside the normal, parliamentary procedure.
.
(FR) While this agreement could have been a real step forward in the fight against serious crime and international terrorism, this Parliament believes its support should be made subject to extravagant conditions and to considerations that are humiliating for the United States.
The reservations concerning the lack of democratic control or the requirement for a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights seem almost fanciful in view of the serious accusations levelled against the United States.
Is it some kind of joke when the report says that the judicial system of some US States does not offer the same level of guarantees that the European Court of Human Rights and EU measures seek to provide for EU Member States?
And what are we to make of the remarks about the untimely nature of an agreement with the United States when several European Union citizens are still being held at the US military base at GuantÃ¡namo Bay, quite unlawfully and without the slightest guarantee that they will receive a fair trial?
When otherworldliness reaches such proportions and produces such absurdities - how can terrorists be equated with ordinary prisoners under common law? - it is bordering on stupidity.
. (PT) I have voted against the report because I believe that the rapporteur has exceeded the competences conferred on the European Parliament by the Treaties, and is seeking, through interpretive methods with which I do not agree, to increase the number and the volume of dossiers that will be subject to consultation.
In fact, my interpretation of Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union diverges from the one put forward in this report, and I believe that the words '... main aspects and... basic choices' of common foreign and security policy must not be understood to be 'practical agreements' and 'specific countries', however wide-ranging the agreements or however important our counterpart might be.
The assumption that the silence of the law lays down a specific obligation for the Council and that this supposed specific obligation results in a general rule laying down the obligation to consult Parliament is an interpretation with which I clearly cannot agree.
I believe that the attempt to impose the State model at Community level does not reflect the current State of the Union.
There is no basis for attempting to give the European Parliament competences similar to those of a national Parliament.
Most particularly, I regret the fact that the original proposal for a recommendation should have been replaced by quite aggressive initiatives, which do nothing to encourage the signing of the EU-US agreements that are the basis for this recommendation.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
A5-0197/2003, by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and support schemes for producers of certain crops (COM(2003) 23 C5-0040/2003 2003/0006(CNS));
A5-0182/2003, by Mr Olsson, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000 (COM(2003) 23 C5-0041/2003 2003/0007(CNS));

A5-0175/2003, by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in dried fodder for the marketing years 2004/05 to 2007/08 (COM(2003) 23 C5-0044/2003 2003/0010(CNS));
A5-0183/2003, by Mr Bautista Ojeda, on behalf of the Committee on and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the common organisation of the market in rice (COM(2003) 23 C5-0043/2003 2003/0009(CNS));
A5-0177/2003, by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a levy in the milk and milk-products sector (COM(2003) 23 C5-0046/2003 2003/0012(CNS));
A5-0181/2003, by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (COM(2003) 23 C5-0045/2003 2003/0011(CNS));
A5-0189/2003, by Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on multifunctional agriculture and the reform of the CAP (2003/2048(INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, my voice is not making it easy, but I shall try to speak clearly.
In January, the Commission presented its legislative proposals for a new reform of the CAP.
In addition to the significant adjustments proposed for some sectors, the proposal's main innovations can be seen in what is known as the decoupling and modulation of direct aid paid to producers.
The aim of decoupling is to convert the current form of aid into a single payment per holding, which would be decoupled from the volumes produced.
Farmers would then always receive this amount, regardless of what they might grow in future and they could even grow nothing, provided that they maintain the land in good farming conditions.
Through modulation, the Commission is attempting to apply an aid reduction rate that would amount to 19% by 2012; around two-thirds of the appropriations thereby freed up would fund future reforms and around one-third would be reserved for strengthening the CAP's second pillar - rural development.
Only farmers receiving less than EUR 5 000 per year would be exempt from this aid reduction.
The proposal that is now being presented here in plenary was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the basis of a compromise proposal tabled by the rapporteur and negotiated with all the political groups.
The essence of this compromise, which I hope will become the position of the European Parliament, is the following:
Firstly, to support only partial and gradual decoupling of direct aid, limited to the arable crop and male bovine sectors.
Consequently, all remaining premiums would continue to be awarded on the basis of the current model; secondly, to support a much more limited form of modulation, of only 6% in the less-favoured regions and of 8% in other regions, since revenue generated in this way will go mainly towards strengthening the second pillar.
Exemptions would also apply to farmers receiving less than EUR 7 500.
By adopting this position, the European Parliament intends to send certain political messages.
The first is that it unequivocally supports a reform of the CAP that makes it more rational from the economic point of view, that will make it easier to implement in an enlarged European Union and which helps to unblock negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.
The second message is that changes of this nature must be undertaken prudently and realistically.
In fact, our position is that aid totally decoupled from production as proposed by the Commission is an interesting model in theory, but poses risks in its practical application and ignores the reality of European farming, the great instability of the markets, which still need border management and protection instruments, and the extremely heterogeneous nature of European farming, in which there are huge differences in income levels and degrees of competitiveness and, consequently, greatly differing effects on the implementation of a decoupled payment scheme.
The third political message is that the risks of production being abandoned following the introduction of a decoupled aid scheme are particularly serious in the outermost less-favoured regions, which have the lowest levels of productivity and which are therefore the least competitive.
This is why Parliament has proposed a lower rate of modulation for these regions, why no decoupled scheme would apply to the outermost regions and why the particular situation of all of these weaker regions would be taken into account, in order to continue to ensure that farmers have alternative means of production.
Fourthly, Parliament also wishes to state that there is no justification, at this stage, for deciding on such a high rate for reducing aid in order to fund future CAP reforms, since we do not yet know either the costs or the timetable of these reforms.
Fifthly, I also wish to emphasise Parliament's commitment to playing a role in strengthening the second pillar of the CAP, particularly by funding new actions to guarantee food safety and quality.
Lastly, it is also worth recalling the proposal that, from 2007, the future decoupled aid scheme will no longer be based on historical reference criteria and will from then be based on two main criteria: the surface area and employment situation of each holding.
To conclude, the European Parliament is thereby making its contribution to adapting the CAP to the new needs and realities that are emerging, but is doing so in a way that avoids or at least minimises the risks of production being abandoned, of increased unemployment and of creating further serious imbalances in some farm schemes, particularly in the less-favoured and outermost regions.
I therefore hope that the Council of Agriculture Ministers, the body responsible for taking the final decision, shares these concerns of Parliament's and forces the Commission to amend its proposal in the negotiations that are now underway.
. (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, there are few things that will be as important in the world of the future as sustainable and environmentally friendly agriculture.
From the start, I have supported Mr Fischler's far-sighted ideas about coming up with proposals as to how we are to reform European agricultural policy.
Unfortunately, these ideas have deteriorated and are still in the process of deteriorating.
I believe it was a deterioration when President Chirac and Chancellor SchrÃ¶der agreed upon a ceiling which was to have been applied, rather, as a floor for the costs of agricultural policy.
I have to acknowledge, unfortunately, that, in my view, what we have arrived at here in Parliament does not improve the proposal but, instead, exacerbates it.
I am concerned that, when they meet, the ministers too will make it still worse.
Not even European farmers seem to understand what is in their own best interests.
Opposition to the Commission's proposal for agricultural reform among farmers, among ourselves in the European Parliament and among agricultural ministers must have to do with their not wishing to see the broader context.
I do not intend to talk about the details of any report, but I intend to concentrate precisely on the bigger picture in my speech.
We must remember that most of the world's food is produced at costs that are not covered by today's low prices on the world market.
Most farmers in industrialised countries therefore require aid if they are to be able to produce food, and farmers in the developing countries need to be paid more.
Aid for agricultural production in the industrialised countries increases production, and the surpluses are exported with the help of subsidies. That reduces prices on the world market.
We must change the systems in order to create a healthy world market.
It should be possible for prices on the world market to rise to a level that enables most farmers to produce food, and it is therefore quite obvious that all forms of aid that distort trade must be done away with.
The EU cannot change this situation by itself but, together with the United States, we should be able to do a lot in this area.
The negotiations within the WTO and the Commission's proposal for agricultural reform are steps in the right direction in this connection.
We must remember, however, that the world is not quite as simple as that.
Even with fair prices on the world market, large areas of small-scale European agriculture would still not be competitive.
We have tough requirements in terms of the environment and animal welfare.
We insist upon food safety and quality.
We demand worker protection.
We wish to conserve the cultivated landscape and natural and cultural environments, and we want to improve social conditions in the countryside.
The market could in theory pay for account to be taken of values such as quality.
Our requirements could be financed through direct aid from society and, more specifically, from the EU when it came, especially, to matters of collective benefit.
The route from high subsidies and collapsed prices on the world market to healthy trade and pricing must, however, be achieved via a change to the way in which aid is at present provided, that is to say through a decoupling of aid from production.
That is where my report on rural development comes in.
Unfortunately, there was too little money when the Commission drafted its proposal.
Thanks to helpful and kind-hearted fellow MEPs in Parliament, I have obtained a little money from Mr Cunha and a certain amount of money from Mrs Jeggle and have thus been able to add a little more for rural development.
That is because the proposed decoupling puts less favoured areas at most risk, and we must deal with the risks as quickly as possible.
I believe that Parliament has come up with an improvement where that matter is concerned.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if, in the EU, we do not in good time modernise our arsenal of aid to agriculture - that is to say, by moving the aid from the Blue to the Green Box, or however one wants to put it - the WTO negotiations may, if they are to lead to any result that is encouraging in a global perspective, forcibly divest us of the weapons we use to protect European agriculture and the European agricultural model.
There would then be nothing for us to have recourse to.
Prevention is better than cure.
That is something we Europeans should also appreciate.
When they meet for negotiations next week, the agricultural ministers will hopefully realise that a poor decision, or no decision at all, may in actual fact lead to a disaster for farmers, the countryside and also consumers who want to see good food in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I am rapporteur on two counts, I will begin, if I may, by presenting the report on reform of the common organisation of the market in cereals, which our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted by a very large majority, and I will then go on to present my second report, on reform of the common organisation of the market in dried fodder, which was also adopted by a very large majority.
Let us begin, then, with the common organisation of the market in cereals.
In its proposed reform, the Commission departs completely from the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, advocating the dismantling of all the vital components of the COM.
What are the Commission's proposals, in fact?
First, a reduction, a further reduction I should say, in the intervention price, taking it to a price below the cost of production, an approach that is both uneconomic and unsustainable.
Then, the abolition of monthly increments.
Then, the abolition of intervention for rye, the abolition of the minimum price for starch potatoes and the abolition of production refunds for starch.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development considered this dismantling of the oldest and most emblematic of the COMs to be neither timely nor justified.
On the intervention price, as rapporteur I had proposed that account be taken of inflation, which is 25.5% since the 1992 reform, bringing the effective decline in internal prices for cereals in real terms to 56%.
I do not need to remind you that the intervention price for cereals is the earnings index for hundreds of thousands of farmers.
Our committee did not want a further reduction, for which there is no justification, not even the trend in world prices, which the Commission itself believes must rise in the years ahead.
The zero price reduction our committee recommends requires no compensation and there is therefore no need for degression.
So far as the monthly increments are concerned, our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was anxious to point out that these are intended to cover a real economic and financial cost, namely the cost of storage, including the modernisation of silos and bringing them up to standard, especially in the matter of security, and that their abolition would be equivalent to a further reduction in the intervention price, without compensation.
Consistency therefore required that the Commission's two proposals, concerning the intervention price and the monthly increments, be treated in the same way.
For rye, where there is a real problem of surpluses, we propose cutting the amounts allocated for intervention so that cultivation of this cereal can in future be concentrated in areas where it is the last resort before leaving the land fallow and where there is no profitable alternative.
As to starch and potato starch, Commissioner, we find the Commission's determination to abolish the schemes that enable European industry to compete against imports on equal terms hard to understand.
It is a gift to third-country starch producers, with the European Union receiving nothing in return.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's proposals therefore differ from the negative measures placed on the table by the Commission, which do not seem to us to give the cereals sector any real prospects of development.
I will turn now, if I may, to the common organisation of the market in dried fodder.
For my part, I had never before seen an explanatory memorandum to a Commission proposal based on so weak an argument.
Relying in fact on an outdated comment in a Court of Auditors report, the executive - the Commission - intended purely and simply to abolish this common organisation of the market from the 2008-2009 marketing year on the grounds that, and I quote the Court of Auditors report, 'production relies on the use of fossil fuel for dehydrating and, in some Member States, on the use of irrigation'.
How casual and offhand can you be, Commissioner, to threaten the future of an entire industry on such a slender basis?
And not just any industry, but one which provides 15% of the fodder protein produced in the Community, an industry of 150 000 producers and 500 000 hectares, an industry whose dehydrating sector consists of 350 fodder processing and packaging units, most of which are farmer-owned cooperatives providing no less than 15 000 jobs.
Have you calculated, Commissioner, the amount of public rural development budgets that would have to be mobilised to preserve the rural activity and jobs that would be destroyed by this industry's euthanasia?
Our Committee on Agriculture therefore had no difficulty in realising that, given the Union's fodder protein deficit, it would be perfectly irresponsible to abolish aid for dried fodder.
If our Parliament adopts the report that its Committee on Agriculture is laying before it, it will be clearly reaffirming the position it previously adopted in the Stevenson report, which called on the Commission to quickly find and put in place the necessary means for reducing this very serious handicap, this strategic dependence, this monstrous vegetable protein deficit, which amounts to more than 75% of our needs.
I recall that the Americans, for their part, had no compunction or hesitation, after the Blair House Agreements, about introducing direct aid for soya, and the WTO did not object.
So why shouldn't we do the same?
Our Committee on Agriculture also considered that the environmental balance in dried fodder could in no way be limited to a vague and unimaginative consideration of fossil fuel consumption.
If all economic activities that consume fossil fuels were banned, you would have come to Brussels on foot, Commissioner.
Alfalfa, on the other hand, which accounts for over 80% of the Union's dried fodder production, has exceptional qualities in two vital fields - soil renewal and savings on phytosanitary products.
Moreover, there are no genetically-modified varieties of alfalfa in Europe.
This crop, which ensures that fodder derived from it is fully traceable, can therefore replace imports that raise a host of GMO issues.
As to dehydration, the amount of fossil energy used has already been greatly reduced over the past few years.
There is still room for improvement, it is true.
We therefore propose, in agreement with the sector, that 'contracts for progress' be concluded, whereby dehydration units will be able to commit to improving their efficiency, their yield, their energy balance.
It seems to us to be more constructive to put schemes in place for this sector with environmental conditions attached than to abolish aid to them completely.
Finally, our Committee felt that the sector was capable of making further agronomic and environmental progress.
That is why we are proposing the creation of a research fund financed from a small levy on aids granted to the sector.
These seem to us, Mr President, Commissioner, the positive directions that the executive - the Commission - ought to take in order to offer a particularly sensitive and strategic sector quite a different prospect than the destruction, without more ado, of a common organisation of the market, which up until now has managed to preserve one of the Union's few sources of vegetable protein.
Mr President, I should like to thank members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for supporting my report on rice by such a large majority.
I would like to thank them too for the amendments tabled concerning the report.
These also enjoyed a broad degree of consensus within the committee.
Commissioner, the least protected open markets are also the most vulnerable.
Areas that have long been cultivated and are a haven for biodiversity are now at risk.
They are threatened by climate change, prolonged drought, and by the considerable pressure exerted on wetlands and protected areas by developers and indeed administrations.
It happens that the largest and most important areas of bird life habitat in Europe are located in such traditional rice-growing areas. It is our responsibility to conserve this habitat regardless of the cost.
The Commission has put forward a proposal for reform of the common organisation of the market in rice as part of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
The proposal takes account of the imbalance caused by the significant increase in imports and in domestic production. Together with the restrictions concerning export refunds, this has resulted in substantial surpluses.
The situation is set to be exacerbated in 2006, as tariffs are to be significantly reduced following implementation of the Everything But Arms programme.
The Commission does itself recognise that it is impossible to estimate the full impact of this initiative. Nonetheless it does maintain that intervention stocks will be unsustainable because of third-country exports.
The whole philosophy of the COM reform proposed by the Commission is based on doing away with intervention. No consideration is given to the special significance of this crop in Europe.
Account must be taken, moreover, of the fact that small regional economies dependent on crops such as rice are more threatened than ever in a globalised and liberalised world.
The COM in rice must be reformed to adjust it to the new spirit of competitiveness prevailing in the markets. Nonetheless, producers must be assured of a reasonable income.
Reform should also be compatible with fair trade and promote the interests of less developed countries.
Further, the European Union must continue to play an important role with regard to landscape, as well as social and environmental conditions.
None of this appears in the Commission's proposal.
It does not feature in relation to management of the market, specific rice payments or decoupled aid.
If there is no intervention, if there is no protection at the frontiers, if the quality and safety we demand for our products is not guaranteed, this sector will cease to exist.
Effectively, through this proposal, the Commission is passing the burden of responsibility for finding solutions to famine in the third world on to rice producers.
This is unfair. A crop such as rice requires special agro-climatic conditions and is therefore bound to be concentrated in specific areas.
If single-crop agriculture ceases in these areas, drought, neglect, or salinisation will inevitably ensue.
In its report, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development endorsed the Commission's decision to reduce the intervention price for rice so as to bring it into line with world prices.
On the other hand, the committee rejected the proposal to set up a private storage regime whenever the price of rice falls below the effective support price.
