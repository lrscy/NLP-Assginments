(BG) Mr. Chairman, Colleagues, The Members of the European Parliament from Ataka Dimitar Stoyanov, Desislav Chukolov and myself, Slavi Binev, declare our firm disagreement with the independence of Kosovo announced on 17 February 2008.
This unilateral secessionist act is an impermissible precedent in international relations.
In our capacity of MEPs, we believe that the Kosovo Regional Assembly has no powers to adopt an act of independence and therefore we consider the separatist government consisting of proven drug traffickers and war criminals to be illegitimate.
The recognition of the independence of Kosovo by the individual Member States or the European Union as a whole would be tantamount to amnesty for the leaders of the Albanian terrorists who have pursued ethnic cleansing against all non-Albanian communities in the region for the last few years.
We express our great disgust and indignation that the ethnic cleansing and destruction of hundreds of Medieval Orthodox churches in Metochia, Kosovo, have taken place before the eyes of the international security forces of NATO and the United Nations.
Keeping in mind the crimes committed, we firmly renounce the artificial establishment of a new Muslim state whose sole objective is to serve as a springboard for the trafficking in weapons, drugs and people towards Western Europe.
Being representatives of the Bulgarian people in the EU, we call upon its institutions to refrain from recognising Kosovo as an independent state and to abide by the existing resolutions of the UN Security Council instead.
Furthermore, we call upon the Security Council to undertake decisive action to preserve the status quo and to overcome the secessionist tendencies in the name of the political stability of the Balkan Peninsula.
(ES) Mr President, the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 18 February will not go down in the history of the EU as a particularly glorious date.
Rather than seeking a solution between the 27, the hot potato of the decision on recognition has been referred to the Member States.
It is always frustrating that, each time we have to make a decision about a sensitive matter at the heart of our continent that affects important principles such as the inviolability of borders, we are not able to speak with one voice.
To complicate matters, the Council conclusions refer to international legality.
It is true that Parliament, like other EU bodies, adopted the Ahtisaari plan, but not as a blank cheque, rather on the understanding that the plan would have the approval of the United Nations Security Council.
Obviously this was not the case, and various conclusions need to be drawn from this.
The first is that it has been said that this case will not set a precedent, that it is a sui generis case, as Mr Wurtz said in his speech.
We need to ask ourselves whether or not we are a Community based on law.
We cannot be so on an Ã  la carte basis.
Obviously this case is going to set a precedent and when international law is flouted it does not come for free and unfortunately there will be consequences.
Secondly, Mr President, how long are we going to be living with a United Nations Security Council in which there is an anachronistic right of veto for the winners of the Second World War enshrined in the San Francisco Charter in 1945?
This is no way to construct an international order or implement fair and effective multilateralism.
Thirdly, Mr President, either the European Union learns once and for all that union is our strength and fragmentation is our weakness, or we will have to renounce our vocation of international leadership in this globalised world and confine ourselves to being what The Economist described us as: the 21st century's most prosperous third world region.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I understand the Kosovo Albanians' rejoicing and delight at the freedom and independence they have gained.
At the same time, however, I understand the consternation and grief of many Serbs in Kosovo, and of course also in Serbia itself.
Unfortunately, no other mutually agreed solution was found.
The MiloÅ¡eviÄ regime achieved anything but the integration of the population and the promotion of respect for Kosovo's Albanian citizens.
I therefore welcome the European Union's decision to create EULEX.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend heartfelt thanks to Mr Rupel, Minister of Foreign Affairs, for the way in which he tried to achieve agreement in the Council in this difficult situation.
This is very positive and should be pointed out clearly.
However, even all the assistance that will now come from Europe is of no use at all unless Kosovo itself gains the commitment of the majority to create a multi-ethnic society in the European sense.
Much of what I have seen in recent days, including the behaviour of Prime Minister Hashim ThaÃ§i, encourages me and prompts me to hope that this multi-ethnic society is firmly seated in the minds of those responsible for the country.
We will see some demonstrations in the coming days, particularly in Serbia.
We should exercise patience. We should extend a hand to Serbia.
We ought to understand that there is a kind of collective sense of loss at work here, and most of all, we should stress what Mr JeremiÄ said today in the Parliamentary committee regarding the renouncing of violence and boycotts.
That is a fundamental element and also the basis of further discussions with Serbia.
We want to accompany Serbia on the road to joining the European Union.
However, that is a decision to be made in Belgrade.
It is not for us to make that decision for Serbia.
I am well aware of the situation in Kosovo.
Many people coexist there.
Perhaps they are set against each other right now but I believe that it is possible for them to stand together, to work with one another.
This mutuality must be the goal of our policies, including here in the European Union and the European Parliament.
(Applause)
(SL) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the situation in Kosovo is quite peaceful, in a way even exemplary and promising, except in the north where the Serbs live.
Individual Serbs are committing acts of arson and that is not right.
The declaration of independence in the Kosovo Assembly was dignified, respectful of all the peoples who live in the region, and in the spirit which should govern the future.
The citizens of Kosovo have deserved our trust; we must have faith in them because they are making decisions about their future.
They sincerely wish for their future soon to be a future in Europe.
As rapporteur for Serbia I welcome the considered conduct of Serbia, which did not introduce economic sanctions against Kosovo.
At this emotional time for Serbia, I have some understanding for the harsh and threatening rhetoric of some politicians.
However, their action should be reasonable and reflect European values.
This independent status should enable Kosovo to gain access to the resources of the International Monetary Fund and to foreign investment for further development.
It is important to strengthen trade links between Kosovo and Serbia in order to stimulate economic growth and contribute to European integration.
Only states may be members of the European Union and Kosovo has become a state.
Now the Serbs in Kosovo also have a European perspective.
Serbia, too, should go ahead as soon as possible and make renewed and intensified efforts regarding its European perspective.
Government working groups must now work even harder.
They should prepare the next steps for Serbia, its economy and its citizens to get closer to the European Union, which is what the citizens desire so much.
Attacking the Embassies of the Member States of the European Union in Belgrade cannot be the way into the European Union, and this was not what the majority of Serbs wanted.
Now that the Serbian ambassadors to the countries which have recognised Kosovo are temporarily returning home, their representatives should endeavour more actively to explain the steps Serbia is taking on the road to the European Union.
There is no turning back; the only road to the future is the road to the European Union.
My concluding words are directed at Minister SamardÅŸiÄ.
Arson is illegal everywhere.
Too many villages have been burnt down in the Balkans in the past decade.
Serbs in Kosovo should be allowed to get involved and to participate in decision-making in the new, independent country.
I am hoping that Belgrade will issue a clear call for participation.
That is what both Serbs and Albanians have deserved.
That is what the whole of the western Balkans and the European Union need and have deserved.
(PL) Mr President, the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo has confronted the international community, and particularly the European Union, with a difficult and responsible task.
This event has significantly complicated the situation both in the Member States and in states with which the Union cooperates and is strengthening ties, such as Ukraine or Georgia.
The recent ostentatious meeting between the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, and the leaders of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, two rebel republics within the territory of Georgia, is a harbinger of the possible behaviour of the Russian Government.
Even before Kosovo's declaration of independence, the Kremlin was warning that it would treat its recognition as a precedent that it would subsequently apply with regard to separatist regimes that were loyal to Russia.
There is good cause for the Balkans to be regarded as one of the most explosive points on the planet.
The proclamation of independence may therefore cause destabilisation in, say, Bosnia and Herzegovina, from which provinces settled by Serbs may wish to detach themselves.
The situation that has come about consequently requires the international community to take some particularly well thought out and responsible decisions, the outcome of which will, however, be freedom and peace.
(NL) Mr President, last Sunday's proclamation of independence by the Kosovo Parliament was inevitable, and was one of the last stages in the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.
Anyone familiar with the situation in the area knows that after nine years of UN supervision and 20 years of discrimination before that, Kosovo could not just return to being part of Serbia.
In this connection, the proclamation of independence is quite a normal process.
Besides, it was made calmly, serenely and unemotionally and with full respect for the Ahtisaari plan in the country's parliament.
The Prime Minister of Kosovo assured the international community very specifically that it would fully protect and respect minority groups.
Incidentally, may I remind my fellow Members that all minority groups in Kosovo actively support independence?
Only the Serbs, with their intransigence and hurt pride, are not on board.
In this sense, the speech by the Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs was rather unfortunate.
None of this detracts from the fact that the future of both Serbia and Kosovo does still lie in the European Union, however.
I look forward to this with great excitement.
(EL) Mr President, the appeals by the Council and the Commission to international law, the principles of the UN and the Helsinki Final Act are truly ironic and provocative.
Today, by recognising the independence of Kosovo, the Council and the Commission are infringing them all, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 1999, according to which Kosovo is part of Serbian territory.
This is a flagrant redrawing of the borders, enforced and masterminded by the United States with the cooperation of the EU itself.
Stop this hypocrisy!
For two years now you have been debating about how Kosovo will become independent and how the EU will send troops to protect its interests in the region.
We believe that the situation is extremely serious.
It will trigger new points of tension and destabilisation for the Balkans in the short term, and throughout the world in the long term, because it will constitute a new precedent.
Your imperialist dogma of 'divide and rule' is well known.
There are plans to carve up a great number of countries throughout the world so that you can control them.
We believe that the peoples of the Balkans and Kosovan residents of Albanian origin will find themselves facing a new storm resulting from the clashes between the United States, the EU and Russia.
That explains our opposition.
We believe that governments ought not to recognise this 'state', which will be a protectorate in the future, and we think that the peoples of the Balkans and Europe should not allow it.
(EL) Mr President, whenever the strength of law yields to the law of the strong, the result is suffering.
It is only in Kosovo that we have seen things happening at lightning speed.
In 40 years in diplomacy, I have never seen such haste in the process not only of proclaiming independence but also of recognition by certain European states.
What they have recognised is not Kosovo, but a Pandora's Box.
I, for one, have never come across a situation so peculiar to itself.
Kosovo itself is not sui generis, but the establishment of a military base in Kosovo is.
In any case, I believe that we have deviated.
In this chamber, in front of MEPs who today represent the democratic governments of Europe, democratic parties and democratic sentiments, I have heard people say: 'You know, we have stepped in to solve the problem where Mr Ahtisaari failed.'
What are we?
Are we a body of appeal?
Is this Parliament a court of appeal?
Instead of worrying about what will happen in Kosovo tomorrow, it would be better, Mr President, for us to think about what will happen when the status of the UN is violated in this insulting, disdainful manner.
(CS) I am convinced that the question we must ask today is no longer whether to recognise Kosovo or not: the question is how to maintain political stability and security in a region dominated by ethnic hatred and fear and 40% unemployment.
Paradoxically, Kosovo's independence comes at a time when European countries are moving towards political federalisation.
The situation in the Balkans, however, clearly demonstrates that EU policy offers no solution that would prevent the division of the state while providing for the peaceful coexistence of all the ethnic and religious entities within it.
In this regard, naming this year the Year of Intercultural Dialogue sounds almost like a mockery.
Ladies and gentlemen, some years ago the United States and the European Union both declared that they would not recognise the independence of Kosovo.
Now not only the United States but also many EU countries have done so.
It is quite clear, therefore, that the process of redefining national entities exists and will continue to exist, that there is no global solution to it and that it damages or destroys relations with the original country.
In such a situation we can have only one goal and that is to prevent bloodshed.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, my thoughts inevitably turn back 17 years, when Slovenia declared its independence; the Minister of Foreign Affairs was Dimitrij Rupel.
The majority of major countries in the UN and the EU and the majority of EU Member States refused to recognise Slovenia at that time.
The Foreign Affairs Minister of one large EU Member State said that if Slovenia became independent, other countries would isolate it for 50 years.
Today, Slovenia is a recognised, respected, successful country, and a good President of the Council of the European Union.
Some of what has been said today in this House should be put into perspective by viewing it in the light of history.
I am glad that Kosovo is now independent as, after decades of oppression, the Kosovars finally have their own free, democratic state, having been oppressed for decades and more recently finding themselves the victim of genocide that was stopped only with international assistance.
I call on Serbia to realise that this is also an opportunity for the Serbian people to move forward into their European future - leaving behind the burdens of the past.
It must then renounce violence, however!
The Serbian Minister for Kosovo cannot then welcome the fact that UN guards on the border with Kosovo are attacked.
It is not appropriate then to accuse the democratically elected leaders of Kosovo of high treason instead of commencing neighbourly dialogue with these victims of genocide.
I cannot state this more clearly: it is unacceptable for Bishop Artemije of the Serbian Orthodox Church to call for war.
This is not acceptable!
This must be very clear - we as the European Union must help Serbia on the way to Europe, but Serbia must also play its part in creating a peaceful, good and neighbourly atmosphere.
Three quarters of the Members of this Parliament were and are in favour of Kosovo's sovereignty, so it is not possible to say that the European Union is divided, and I am happy that we are now entering into a good European future for the entire region.
(Applause)
(HU) Mr President, it had become increasingly clear that the declaration of a monitored independence for Kosovo had become inevitable.
Our prime task now is to ensure a successful resolution of the situation in Kosovo, to secure stability in the region, to establish an appropriate role for the European Union, to create an EU protectorate, but without it taking on the role of regent.
On the one hand I understand the pain of the Serbs: my country lost 60% of its territory after World War I. Serbia is losing nearly one fifth of its territory, and it is a great tragedy for any nation to lose the cradle of its history, statehood and religion.
On the other hand it is a fact that long ago Serbia lost any moral rights it had with regard to Kosovo because the Serbian government failed to provide a proper homeland for the Albanian community living there.
We are sure that Serbia's diplomatic response will not jeopardise the country's integration into the European Union.
We must help Serbia to deal with its loss by speeding up convergence with the European Union.
It is important to offer gestures, to send positive messages, and so it is vital for the EU to adopt a clear plan of action for lifting the visa requirements for Serbia and the other countries of the western Balkans.
Let us speed up Serbia's integration, but without relaxing the requirements in any way.
It is understandable that some EU Member States have reservations.
I feel that the concerns of Cyprus and Spain are legitimate, but I am baffled by the apprehensions raised by the Romanian and Slovakian political elites.
No-one is threatening these countries' integration.
Separation and unilateral declarations of independence must not be a precedent for the EU in future.
Implementation of the Ahtisaari Plan, on the other hand, which provides a secure regime for minorities, may set a positive precedent for Europe to follow in future with regard to protection of minorities.
Thank you for your attention.
(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Foreign Minister, Kosovo's declaration of independence and our recognition of it is not tantamount to choosing the lesser evil; it is the only appropriate step we can take in the present situation.
Negotiations have unfortunately failed to produce results; continuing failure to reach a settlement on Kosovo's status has constantly destabilised the region.
There was no other way of resolving the situation than the one that took place last week, definitive settlement of Kosovo's status and acceptance of Kosovo's independence.
We welcome the fact that a large majority in the Kosovo parliament voted in favour of the Ahtisaari Plan.
We expect Kosovo to translate the provisions of the Ahtisaari Plan into action, paying particular attention to the provisions concerning protection of minorities.
The Ahtisaari Plan represents Europe's boldest regime for protecting minorities, and it may serve as a model and an example of good practice for the whole of the region, so it is very important that we hold Kosovo to account on this matter.
The future for Kosovo and Serbia lies in European integration.
This has now become easier for both these countries.
They have rid themselves of a grave and crippling problem that until now had consumed all the creative energy of both countries.
Whether they use this opportunity will depend on them.
If they do, both Kosovo and Serbia must be given all the support the European Union can provide, especially with regard to prompt lifting of visa requirements and provision of financial support.
It is wonderful that the European Union unanimously approved the mandate of the civilian mission in Kosovo.
It is all the more worrying, however, that Member States of the European Union have failed to reach unanimity regarding recognition of Kosovo.
If the European Union expects to be taken seriously in the international political arena, failure to reach a consensus on important events taking place in a neighbouring country is something that it cannot allow to happen.
It is therefore important for the European Union to speak and act in unison.
To conclude, I wish Kosovo and all its citizens every success and all the best for the future.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President PÃ¶ttering, by saying that the declaration of independence expresses the will of Kosovo's citizens to take control of their own destiny, is making a statement of historical importance.
The independence of Kosovo is a concrete application in Europe of the principle of self-determination for the people sanctioned by the UN Charter.
Of course, many of us are very concerned about the creation of the first Islamic state in Europe, welcomed by the entire jihadist media, for example the enthusiastic leader of the Islamic satellite television channel Al-Arabiya, and about the fate of the Serbian Orthodox Christian minority, about whom we are reminded by the wise words from the Vatican.
However - and I particularly stress this - it is still undeniably an important legal and political precedent.
There is no point in denying it; it is important for the peoples of Europe, from Corsica to Flanders, Sardinia to the Basque country, Brittany to Occitania, and in our Padania, now regrettably nations without States, who aspire to the dream of self-determination and freedom.
Long live the Europe of the people!
Long live free Padania!
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as always when someone acts outside international law, Europe is divided and undone.
Unilateral acts create very serious precedents, and we have now heard what Mr Borghezio had to say.
Tension is heightened in an atmosphere that is anything but calm and is full of geopolitical comparisons.
Europe is lacking unity, authoritativeness and transparency.
We have even read of meetings between the government currently holding the Presidency of Europe and the United States Administration, which has suggested the lines to be taken.
It is no accident that this Parliament is politically impotent today, despite the celebrations for the new Treaty.
The only way of turning the page is to go back to international law and an independent vision that sees the whole of the Balkans in Europe, recognising the right of the whole area.
I hope it is not too late.
(CS) The European Union's attempt to present Kosovo as a unique case is no more than an embarrassing example of wishful thinking.
Not only does Kosovo create a dangerous precedent, it also has an historical precursor.
It is a mirror image of the situation in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s and its German minority.
How ironic it is that history repeats itself!
The first four EU countries to proclaim in unison that they would recognise the separatist republic were also the four signatories to the Munich Agreement.
Back then, 80 years ago, Chamberlain, Daladier, Mussolini and Hitler carved up Czechoslovakia; today it is again Britain, France, Italy and Germany who recognise the carving-up of Serbia.
They are tearing from Serbia the historical territory of the Kosovo Field, where in 1389 the Serbian nobility fought an heroic battle to stop the advance of the Ottoman Turks into Europe.
That is where Serbian identity was born.
Now we, the European Union, are transplanting this historic heart of Serbia elsewhere.
Shame on us, Munichites!
(PL) Mr President, in today's debate on the Serbian Province of Kosovo, I would like first of all to protest against the illegal actions of the Albanian authorities, which have been inspired by the United States.
In the face of the dismantling of the Serbian State, the reaction of the European Union and certain Member States is outrageous.
The European Union is supporting the Albanian separatists and is deciding at the same time to set up a mission in Kosovo that is dubious in the light of international law, and in conflict with the UN position.
I am outraged that the EU authorities wish to be a party in this Balkan conflict without having the right or any mandate to do so.
By what right is Brussels once again interfering in the affairs of a sovereign state, and violating international arrangements to boot?
What happened on Monday in Brussels reminds me of the Munich Conference in 1938.
Here, once again, international society is remaining silent and allowing Berlin and Washington to see their interests put into effect.
For the first time since 1945, in breach of international law, borders in Europe are being changed for ethnic reasons.
A domino effect and subsequent conflicts linked to actions by Albanian separatists are inevitable.
Not much imagination is required to see how independence for this Serbian province could impact on ethnic feuds in other parts of Europe and the world.
(RO) Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, after 20 years of political and military confrontations, after 20 years of major errors in the Balkans, we ask ourselves whether the Kosovo solution, namely the unilateral declaration of independence of the Kosovo province, is legal and opportune.
The Kosovo solution is neither legal, nor opportune.
It is not legal because no international law principle justifies the unilateral declaration of independence of the Kosovo province.
Moreover, recently, the Secretary General of the United Nations Organization has found no answer to the question of whether the solution is legal or illegal, leaving a press conference organized at the United Nations headquarters.
It is also not opportune because it creates a dangerous precedent.
Not for the European Union Member States, not for Slovakia or Romania, countries that have an emancipated and modern legislation regarding minorities, but it creates a dangerous precedent for Abkhazia, for South Ossetia and, especially, for Transnistria, where there are frozen conflicts since the time of the Kosovo conflict.
Nevertheless, it equally creates a dangerous precedent for the Balkans - the Republic of Srpska, for instance- for other regions inhabited by minorities in the Balkans.
Nevertheless, it also creates a dangerous precedent for the European Union.
It is often said that the Balkans produce more history than they can consume. It seems that, this time, the Balkans have produced more history than the European Union itself can consume.
The proof is the fact that we stand here divided from the point of view of recognizing the independence of the Kosovo province.
I can tell you that Romania will not recognize the independence of the Kosovo province and the national action is supported by the Romanian delegation in the European People's Party.
We know very well, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen in this room, here, what we should do about Serbia.
Its future is, obviously, European.
Yet, we do not know what we should do about Kosovo.
And I have to confess to you, with all the indulgence you can give me, that the visa system alone, the liberalization of the visa system, will not be enough in order to grow this region of our Europe.
(BG) Dear Mr. Chairman, Dear Mr. Rupel, Dear Mr. Rehn, Perhaps now is the time to once more express our regret that no agreement was reached on the status of Kosovo between Serbia and Kosovo but there was no way for the negotiations to continue forever since both sides remained at their mutually exclusive positions.
We could also voice our regret that, today, Serbia and the Serbian people have to foot the bill of Great Serbian nationalism, to which the country is bidding farewell, although with some difficulties.
However, we have to be realistic and emphasize that the independence of Kosovo, though not independence in the full sense of the word, is a fact, a real fact that, of course, attributes new quality to the ongoing processes.
We have to take into consideration this fact and the disputes whether to recognise it or not do now change its existence.
We cannot but think of the possible consequences that this act will produce on the stability in South-Eastern Europe, hopefully, of a short-term nature only.
Still, it is necessary for the European Union to make several important steps: first, to assist the establishment of an adequate administrative and governmental structure in Kosovo, then to speed up the integration of Serbia by rapidly signing a stabilisation and association agreement, and to pay special attention to Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro because there is the risk of missing the forest in South-Eastern Europe for the tree.
Mr President, I agree with those who say that there really was no other option but the independence of Kosovo.
The EU is taking on its largest civilian mission ever and it will be very important that it is successful.
It is quite an extraordinary situation.
It is rather difficult to explain to outsiders that, although not all Member States can agree on recognising Kosovo, they all support the EULEX mission.
Indeed, a country like Spain is supplying personnel to the mission - this is very EU, very Brussels.
But it must succeed.
I agree with Commissioner Rehn that the message to Serbia must be that the time has come to turn the page and, as others have commented, in that context it was somewhat disappointing to listen to Mr JeremiÄ, the Serbian Foreign Minister, this afternoon.
I understand the rawness and the sense of grievance, but things must move on rapidly.
I hope that Prime Minister Thaci will make it absolutely clear to his compatriots that the protection of the Serb minority and other minorities in Kosovo is an absolute priority, because violence will not be tolerated.
In that context, I was disappointed that the Serb Foreign Minister did not condemn the violence that has been perpetrated by Serbs in the last few years.
He said Serbia did not encourage or instigate it, but he did not actually use the word 'condemn', which was disappointing.
Finally, the important thing, as others have said, is going to be economic development.
There is 40% unemployment in Kosovo, and there is massive unemployment in Serbia as well.
Let us move on towards rapid integration in the EU, moving via visa liberalisation, which I hope will come very soon.
(GA) Mr President, I heartily welcome the announcement of Kosovo's independence last Sunday.
Nine years have passed since the terrible bombing of Kosovo on the orders of MiloÅ¡eviÄ's regime.
The people of Kosovo have a right to independence and in a way the events of the last nine years have contributed to the advent of this independence.
It is extremely important that the civil and political rights of the Serbian minority still residing in Kosovo are fully respected.
The European Union will have to support the Government of Kosovo in order to promote the economy of the country, because the rate of unemployment in Kosovo is at 40% and that must be rectified.
I hope this is a new beginning for Kosovo and that the European Union will be happy to support the rebuilding of this new state in the years to come.
I also hope that it will become an example of the wishes of the European Union that people and communities can live in harmony.
(EL) Mr President, the EU does not build states; it incorporates them.
The diverging European views on the problem of Kosovo constitute an admission of the CFSP's failure.
The EU has sacrificed its internal consultation to the political strength of its Member States.
Article 11 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates as a precondition that that the Union shall act in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter, including those on external borders.
Since the EU is a union of law, as Mr Salafranca has said, what is the basis of European legal liability?
Specifically, on what legal basis have certain Member States pressed for recognition on the basis of international law?
Security Council Resolution 1244 of 1999 does not provide sufficient justification or legitimacy for this.
The point of the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on the sui generis nature of the Kosovo situation is that the case in question has no precedent.
I hope that it does not constitute a precedent.
It is unique; there is a special reference to adherence to the fundamental principles of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, which, as is explicitly stated, are not in doubt.
Finally, I should like to remind you that these principles constitute the hard core of international law on vested interests.
(ES) Mr President, the debate is already at an advanced stage; I do not think that I can contribute a great deal to it, not even in terms of passion, but I do think we have to focus on the importance of international law and international commitments.
On 16 December 1991, EU Ministers adopted guidelines on the recognition of new States in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union and affirmed respect for the inviolability of all borders and that borders could be changed only by peaceful means and by common agreement.
Secondly, the resolution under which there is currently a European presence in Kosovo - UN Security Council Resolution 1244 - specifically lays down that the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries of the region must be respected.
A breach of international law, of the commitments of the European countries and of the UN resolutions has been committed.
The consequences will be costly for all of us.
(PL) Mr President, recognition of Kosovo's independence is equivalent to opening Pandora's box in Europe.
This is a dangerous precedent, in breach of international law - especially of UN resolutions - which has stated unambiguously that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia.
Today, with international approval, steps are being taken to dismantle one of Europe's states.
I am saying this as an MEP from a state that has already experienced such dismantling in its history.
There can be no consent to this.
This is a dangerous precedent, since Kosovo's footsteps have been followed by South Ossetia and Abkhazia, among others, who have already announced a desire to break away and a desire to declare independence.
What shall we say about Cyprus, which is striving for unity at all costs?
With such an example, and by setting this example for the Cypriots, we are putting them in an unclear and ambiguous situation in which they will be unable to fight for the unity of their island.
Above all, ladies and gentlemen, recognition of Kosovan independence is a gift for the progressive Islamisation of Europe, and I do not think that any of us meant that to happen.
(ES) Mr President, I regret Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence.
It is not good news for Europe.
It is the last link in a chain of failures: a failure to coexist, which resulted in the crisis in 1999, a failure by the parties and the international community itself to reach an agreed solution and a failure by the Security Council.
There is a fear that the entity that some hastened to recognise is another failure.
It should provide a framework for democratic, secure coexistence, in which citizens prosper and the rights of minorities are respected; it should also avoid being a problem for the stability of the region.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has also failed, as it has not found a solution in its neighbourhood that is in line with international law.
Europe should mean union, not separation; agreement, not multilateralism; de jure, not de facto; integration, not ethnic division.
As Europeans we have a significant responsibility in this area: we were in the majority in the Contact Group, the UN Special Envoy and his team were Europeans, and it was the European Council which, in December, hastily decided to send a mission to Kosovo without legal basis.
I would like to point out that paragraph 15 of Parliament's Resolution in March said the following: 'Considers that the adoption of a new UN Security Council resolution is also crucial for the future engagement of the EU in Kosovo, and that no enhanced EU involvement should be envisaged in the absence of such a resolution.'
The circumstances in the case of Kosovo are exceptional.
However, there are irresponsible people who want to change the borders of European countries and are using it as a precedent.
This is why the inviolability of the borders of EU Member States needs to be reiterated.
Mr President, I am persuaded that the fact Kosovo was already a UN protectorate, that the solution is supported by the UN Secretary-General, and that negotiations had failed, all mean that Kosovo is a unique case in our world.
I refute those who argue that this is an illegal act.
Paragraph 11a of UN Resolution 1244 makes clear that this is 'pending a final settlement'.
Paragraph 7 specifically authorises security by 'relevant international organisations ... with all necessary means'.
I accept that this is a test of credibility for the European Union, that any failure to respect the Serb population's rights in the new Kosovo would be a victory for ethnic cleansing in reverse, and that we should emphasise that Serbia, as well as Kosovo, will be equal partners as future members of our European Union.
But let not the ghost of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ stalk this decision or this Chamber.
The entrenchment of peace, the precursor of reconciliation, the platform for a whole region - as the fall of the Berlin Wall was for Eastern Europe, so let independence for Kosovo be for former Yugoslavia.
(SL) After the changes that have taken place, our task is not to explain history or to spread alarm by talking about the domino effect, but to support the development which will ultimately stabilise the region and bring it closer to European standards and a European perspective.
It is an important fact in this extremely complicated story that the European Union has taken on a big responsibility.
It was united in its decision on the EULEX mission to help in the building-up of institutions and in political and economic development.
The European Commission has also set out measures to support the development of the wider region.
All this is aimed at defusing this dangerous situation that offers no prospects, and removing the unusual paradox that part of Europe, surrounded by the Member States, is a protectorate of the United Nations.
It is not only my wish, but also the wish of others, that the reconciliation, peace and cooperation which now characterise the European Union may become a key principle or a foundation for coexistence within Kosovo, as well as in the relationship between Serbia and Kosovo.
In these demanding days for both Serbia and Kosovo, and in the spirit of what I said earlier, I would like to welcome the words and actions of all those who have expressed their commitment to peace, moderation, openness and the future.
(EL) Mr President, we are faced with a state of affairs that may have far-reaching consequences, not only for the Balkan region but also internationally.
The claim that it is a sui generis case does not indemnify us.
The circumvention of international law and its rules is highly dangerous.
For the first time, borders have been changed with neither the agreement of the parties involved, nor the approval of the Security Council.
Once again, Europe has appeared divided on such a vital issue and has repeated the mistakes of the past.
The extent to which the 2 000-strong force can guarantee safety and stability in the region is also in doubt.
The declaration of Kosovo's independence is now a fact.
We support a peaceful, multi-ethnic Kosovo integrated in the bosom of the EU.
The solution to the crisis can only be to secure the path to rapid unification of the Western Balkans with the EU.
The immediate signing of the Stability and Growth Pact is necessary, especially for Serbia, as the only way of providing real support for its democratic forces.
Finally, the way the situation is handled will be a crucial test for European foreign policy.
Mr President, I fail to see the rush to resolve the Kosovo issue, circumventing the UN and ignoring current international law.
I believe that Kosovo's new nationhood will be difficult, with no obvious exit strategy for the EU, whose presence will be long term, given a hostile Serbia next door and the prevalence of organised crime.
Independent Kosovo's acceptance by Russia and China, who are on the UN Security Council, is very unlikely in the foreseeable future.
We have now managed successfully to injure a Serbia trying to forget MiloÅ¡eviÄ and build a democratic future.
Its loss may fan nationalist sentiments and drive Serbia towards Russia, which, in turn, may apply the precedence of the Kosovo situation in frozen conflicts ranging from Transnistria to Abkhazia.
Russia will, interestingly, now claim the moral high ground in international law - perhaps for the first time in recent history.
I have considerable sympathy with Cyprus, which has refused to join the majority of EU Member States in recognising Kosovo.
Already, Mr Talat, the leader of the so-called 'breakaway republic of Northern Cyprus' claims Kosovo as a precedent for his territory.
As an aside to Mr Howitt - UN talks also failed over the unification of Cyprus, so that issue is not unique to this case.
Not surprisingly, Spain is concerned about the Basque Country and Catalonia, and Slovakia about its Hungarian minority.
Curiously, although the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has welcomed an independent Kosovo as a potential new member, Azerbaijan, although in the OIC, is wary over Nagorno-Karabakh claiming independence and refuses to recognise Kosovo.
Therefore, whatever the EU and the US are saying about this issue being sui generis, clearly not all the countries of the world agree.
Mr President, I would like to make two points.
Firstly, the most important thing is that the independence of Kosovo was proclaimed after supervision of the situation there by the international community for a number of years, and the international community, after long deliberations, could not find a better solution to the problem than the independence of Kosovo.
Therefore, following Russian attempts to relate the situation of Kosovo to some other regions of Europe, like Transnistria, South Ossetia or Abkhazia, it is not difficult to make this counter-argument dangerous or not suitable for Moscow itself.
Would Russia agree to withdraw from those territories and leave control of the 'frozen conflicts' areas of Europe to the international community?
If so, then we, the EU, would get a real chance to reach a long-awaited solution, and we should be interested in this.
Secondly, it is well known that some countries try to warm their hands above the embers of each fireplace of international instability.
This time, Russia, pretending to defend the interests of Serbia, decided to play its own geopolitical game, pretending that, without its assent, no problem in the world would be solved.
This position is not new or unexpected.
But Russia is not the most important player this time, as it does not have real power to angle events in a way which would not be acceptable for the West.
For instance, in the future, Kosovo's attempts to join the United Nations might not be easy, but Russia cannot achieve any significant isolation of the state on the international stage because, when Kosovo is recognised by a majority of EU Member States, the United States and some other countries, the isolation will become meaningless.
I salute the independence of Kosovo and wish the Kosovar people the best of luck in building their state.
Mr President, the difference between the external actions of the EU and other international actors is respect for international legality and UN decisions.
I am afraid that, by encouraging and recognising the independence of Kosovo outside the current body of international legality and the UN, that defining characteristic of EU external actions becomes questionable, if not even untenable.
I only hope that we will not live to regret the decision we have taken with respect to Kosovo.
(SK) Kosovo has declared independence.
This is no surprise; it was to be expected.
The international community must take note of it.
If this region is supposed to be peaceful and stable then the EU Member States must act as one and give their full support to this country's development, in accordance with Mr Martti Ahtisaari's plan.
Those Member States and politicians, from Slovakia too, who spread unsubstantiated rumours that this act will be a dangerous precedent for other countries are mistaken.
Kosovo is a unique case.
We should look back at the root of those bloody events nine years ago when Serbian military forces committed genocide against the Albanians.
It is quite understandable that members of the Albanian community do not want to live within the Republic of Serbia.
Making them to do so by force would result in a war.
The EU has a very important role to play in creating a society in which all citizens are equal and where minority communities have extensive rights to maintain and develop their identity, as well as a right to run their own public administration: this means extensive autonomy for the Serbian community.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to make three comments.
Firstly, the fact that we are in this situation shows that we as the European Union were once again not in a position to hold our own between the two poles of Russia and the United States.
My second point is this: we must now do everything we can to establish minority and cultural rights in Kosovo.
The Kosovar Government would therefore be well advised to do a great deal in far-reaching, practical ways.
I would like to thank you, President-in-Office of the Council, for making an important contribution through EULEX.
Thirdly, for historical and cultural reasons, I have a lot of sympathy for the sentiments in Serbia right now and I believe that, for this reason, we need to be patient as we allow Serbia to find its way to the European Union, and that we must support that process.
We must also make it clear, however, that violence will not be tolerated.
We should continue to pay our funds - EUR 187 million in 2007 - but on condition that things proceed peacefully, in order to pave the way for a stable region.
Mr President, the Serbia of MiloÅ¡eviÄ - and even after him - followed the advice of its big brother, losing every time rather than taking a realistic stance and trying to find ways towards more amicable divorces, with the prospect of meeting again in Europe.
Maybe it will happen now.
One special remark to those worried about one-sided interpretations of international law, the integrity of states or the sovereignty of territories and peoples: we should understand and take into account the fact that a state which seeks to exterminate or expel all citizens belonging to a different ethnic population is killing not only them but, first of all, its own claim to sovereignty - sovereignty over mass graves.
Integrity of cemeteries is not a case to accept.
And no parallels with the Basque country, Quebec or Abkhazia should be accepted.
Neither Madrid nor Ottawa nor Tbilisi is going to bomb and kill those people.
Russia is different.
Russia has also been denied by its own actions of repeated genocide and has no more right to sovereignty over survivors in Chechnya but merely the medieval law of the fist.
Mr President, some claim that we should leave aside the issue of recognition of the state, when speaking about Kosovo, and instead deal with recognition of the reality.
The reality is that, after its statement of self-determination, Kosovo is neither independent nor able, for long, to be an independent, sustainable state.
It was a protectorate and it will remain a protectorate.
The reality is that the European Union is divided between the so-called realists and the so-called legalists.
The reality is that, by calling Kosovo a sui generis case, we are admitting that international law is either insufficient or inadequate and we are therefore finding a solution outside the law.
This would lead us to replace the power of right with the power of might.
I think this is neither the goal nor the basic value of this Union.
(PT) Following Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence, the worst thing that could happen now would be for the political impasse to place us in the unwelcome situation of looking on as tensions mount.
We must therefore establish the lowest common denominator in defining our future decisions and actions; from that point of view, what the President-in-Office of the Council said left me not exactly satisfied, but hopeful.
We must remind Kosovo that the path it now takes will inevitably influence its future relations with the European Union and that, therefore, we are willing to help them and we have an obligation - in our own interest, too - to hold out not one hand but both hands to Serbia and to say that we retain the firm conviction that Serbia's future is in Europe.
Twenty years after the collapse of the Soviet empire, let us not provoke what the communists of those days did not manage to do: to put Serbia in the exclusive sphere of Moscow.
We must not make that mistake.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come at last: yes, those who want the independence of Texas to be recognised by the United States, those who want to see the west of Romania separated from it as a purely Hungarian territory, those who want an independent Scotland, Catalonia, Basque Country, and all the other states that will no doubt come into existence in Latin America and Africa.
It is said that Kosovo does not set a precedent.
That is a mistake: it is a territory that has been ethnically cleansed of eight nationalities with the help and acquiescence of the occupational forces, a territory that is riddled with drugs, human trafficking, 50% unemployment and constant pressure on the remaining Serbs.
Now it is declaring independence of a second Albanian state and that sets a bad example.
It will now continue to haunt all of you who have literally massacred international law here.
Shame on you: this is a second Munich and no true democrat should ever support it.
President-in-Office of the Council. - First of all, I would like extend my heartfelt thanks to Parliament and the Members who supported the Council's position.
I accept that there are different opinions; that is normal for parliaments.
However, it seems to me that the European Union has been given support at today's session.
I would like to answer some questions.
The first question is on the system we are envisaging for command, that is to say for future responsibilities, and here I am thinking, of course, of institutions in Kosovo.
The European Union has obviously sent a special representative to Kosovo.
In its declaration of independence, the Kosovo Parliament agreed, from the outset, to the provisions of the Ahtisaari Plan.
The provision of the entire plan will be built into the Kosovo constitution and into its legislation.
Accordingly, the task of the European Union's special envoy will be to monitor the local authorities and to safeguard the obligations which the new status demands.
After the International Civilian Office has been established, the European Union's Special Representative will become the High Representative for civilian affairs for the international community.
He will also give political guidance to EULEX.
I would like to add that the European Union has done much in recent days, primarily to calm the situation and secure adequate support for Kosovo.
In addition to the mission about which the Council made a decision a few days ago, I would like to mention yesterday's visit to PriÅ¡tina by the Secretary-General and the High Representative, Javier Solana.
I would like to quote just one sentence from his address.
Mr Solana said:
'I would like to transmit that the sentiment, the joy, that you spread so respectfully on the streets over the last days now has to be converted into positive and constructive energy in order to move society forward.'
'I would like to transmit that the sentiment, the joy, that you spread so respectfully on the streets over the last days now has to be converted into positive and constructive energy in order to move society forward.'
That means, I think, that all of us also wish our friends in Kosovo to be prepared to convert the energy they have displayed in the last few days into rational action that will secure a respectable European future not only for Kosovo, but also of course for Serbia.
I think much has been said in the speeches and Members' contributions today about Serbia deserving to continue on its path towards integration with the European Union, and as I was listening to the speeches by various representatives of this Parliament, I could not help envisaging that in the future Serbian will be spoken here too.
And, I hope, Albanian as well.
I trust we will hear the languages of countries which so badly wish to become members of this Parliament and the European Union.
However, in view of the remarks we heard from some of our Spanish friends, I would not say that harmonisation of the text of the decisions was not difficult for the General Affairs and External Relations Council, but in the end, we managed to agree with our Spanish and Cypriot colleagues on a text which reflects unanimity, joint decision-making and collective thinking.
Finally, I would like to say, Mr President, that naturally I have to agree with the speech by my colleague from Slovenia, Mr Kacin, when he spoke of the need for Serbs in Kosovo to accept Kosovo as their homeland too and take part in its government.
Of course, Kosovo is their country too and every delay by Kosovan Serbs in cooperating in the government of Kosovo may be detrimental.
May I say that these debates have given me encouragement and I would like to thank you, Mr President, and the ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament for all these constructive comments.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I want to thank the House for a most responsible debate.
It was widely recognised today that the European Union has indeed left no stone unturned in seeking a negotiated solution, but this has unfortunately been in vain.
Consequently, we are now bound to steer the process to its conclusion.
Many of you also underlined the importance of not isolating Serbia, and especially of reaching out to the younger generation in Serbia.
I fully agree, and am happy to inform you that we already have a visa facilitation agreement in force with the countries of the Western Balkans, including Serbia.
This means easier procedures when applying for visas, and exemptions for certain groups like students and business people.
I am also happy to inform you that we have already started a special dialogue on visa-free travel, which is very important for ordinary Serbian citizens and other peoples of the region.
We did this with Serbia in January, and my colleague Commission Vice-President Frattini is in fact in Skopje today, and in Podgorica tomorrow, to launch dialogues with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and with Montenegro.
But in order for that to succeed we need determination and unity throughout the institutions, including the Council, in terms of ministers of the interior who have strong powers in this area.
I count on your support in this regard, so that we can make real progress, united on this matter.
(FR) As far as European unity is concerned, the fact that the EU has been able to maintain its unity on such a tricky and controversial subject is truly of major significance.
I would even say that the common foreign policy has responsibly passed one of its most serious tests since its creation.
I would like to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency on this outcome, which reflects your profound commitment to the future of the Western Balkans in Europe.
I also note, with much satisfaction, the desire of the future French Presidency to support fully the European perspective of the Western Balkans.
Therefore 2008 will be a particularly important year in the journey of the Western Balkans towards Europe.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) In central, eastern and south-eastern Europe those of us who were born in this less fortunate region of Europe have learned from experience that spoken words and paper promises have little credence.
The important thing is how these are complied with in reality.
In Kosovo the Ahtisaari Plan has succeeded in becoming an idea that can be realised beyond the promises, bringing calm to the region.
Some say it cannot set a precedent; but why not, one may ask, if it creates a functioning regime for protecting minorities?
If it is adhered to in reality, then it should indeed serve as a precedent.
Those of us who grew up as part of a minority and were not masters of our own destiny can only welcome any innovation that promises a long-term solution for ethnic communities that live side by side.
If the Ahtisaari Plan is adhered to and implemented, the story of Kosovo that is now beginning may be just such a long-term solution.
We are concerned for the minorities living in other areas of Serbia who are anxiously following these events.
Will there be a solution that provides reassurance for these minorities, or for ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina?
I ask the Council and the Commission to ensure that the general unrest does not lead to irreversible actions, to resettlement measures in Vojvodina.
Let us not allow ethnic tensions to be vented on the minorities still living there.
The events currently taking place must not be allowed to result in more instances of people being deprived of their rights, but in a strengthening of rights.
Let us ensure that good precedents are finally set in the Balkans, giving the ethnic communities living there hope and prospects for the future at last.
in writing. - (PT) The unilateral declaration of independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo is not inevitable.
It is certainly an extremely serious development and a dangerous precedent in international law, with unforeseeable consequences for the stability of borders, in particular on the continent of Europe.
It is certainly a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.
It is certainly an illegal decision in the light of the most basic principles of international law.
It is certainly the artificial creation of a pseudo-State under supervised sovereignty - and whatever that might be it will certainly have less sovereignty - or, rather, of a protectorate created and imposed by aggression and military occupation, by the USA, NATO and the EU.
It is certainly an attempt to perpetuate by means of a fait accompli policy, the political, economic and military domination of that most important region of Europe by the USA and the EU's major powers.
That illegality must not be recognised, either formally or in practice, in particular through sending and taking part in the 'EU mission to Kosovo'.
That EU mission does not actually have any UN mandate.
It is an EU mission which, in addition to being illegal in itself, is making an agreement with an illegal entity, therefore rendering it doubly illegal.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, Finnish Councillor of State Harri Holkeri, who was acting as a negotiator in the Kosovo crisis a while ago, thought that the Albanians' quest for independence could not be ignored forever, as that would be a return not to a zero score but a lot less.
As many Members have said, Kosovo's independence was an inevitability.
It has likewise been pointed out that Kosovo is a sui generis case, and so independence poses no threat to the international principles of law for resolving conflict.
Europe therefore got a new country based on sustainable criteria.
Of course it is regrettable that no reconciliation, not even any minimal level of tolerance, has been achieved between the parties.
The international community can hardly be accused of not trying, as negotiations were headed by the distinguished peacemaker Martti Ahtisaari.
Now we need to remain adamant that Ahtisaari's plan continues to be the guiding star whilst the new country is being built.
Its requirements offer a chance for the Western model of rule of law and internal and external stability in the region.
The security of Kosovo and the west Balkans is above all a European issue.
Whilst, therefore, it is once again evident that the UN Security Council is incapable of taking responsibility for the situation, the EU has to prepare to make an effort.
The integration of the west Balkans with the general European framework of stability is probably our greatest challenge since the Union began.
Regional tensions are now threatening to increase, the nation is frustrated by unemployment, and corruption and crime have taken hold.
The declaration of independence in Kosovo was eagerly awaited, and it led to real joy among the populace, which, as a European, I can easily relate to.
Now that exhilaration should be tapped to build what is the hardest thing: lasting peace and stability.
It succeeded 50 years ago elsewhere in Europe - why not in the Balkans at long last?
in writing. - (NL) My group and the national delegation of my party in the European Parliament have decided recently to reject the present path towards Kosovo's independence.
I can understand this, as the EU is currently behaving like a superpower, unilaterally imposing its will on Serbia, which has already been humiliated many times, and treating Kosovo as its protectorate.
This does not mean that I take back what I have said on the subject in past years.
Under the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974, which gave Kosovo almost as much autonomy as the six federal republics of the time, it might have remained possible for Serbs and Albanians to coexist peacefully within a single federal state.
The unilateral abolition of that autonomy in the 1980s made the Serbian State a pointless and even harmful entity in the eyes of most inhabitants of Kosovo.
Kosovo has been behaving like an independent state since as long ago as September 1991, with its own president, parliament and educational system.
If, back then, the outside world had acted in a timely fashion and recognised that state, along with the other successor states of Yugoslavia, no violent UÃK would have arisen, the inhabitants of Kosovo would not have been condemned to resort to crime as a source of income, and there would have been no cause for the war of 1999.
in writing. - (EL) Eight years after NATO's war in Yugoslavia, the Kosovo problem not only remains unsolved, but also has become more intractable.
The 'standards before status' criterion (i.e. democracy, return of refugees, conditions of multicultural coexistence, etc., before the final regime is decided upon) established by UN Resolution 1244 has not been fulfilled in basic terms.
Nevertheless, the Bush Administration pushed the leadership of the Albanian Kosovars towards a unilateral declaration of independence, with all that this entails for peace and stability in the Balkans, as well as for other international issues.
By approving a new mission in the region, the EU is supporting this policy and is contributing to the violation of UN Resolution 1244 of 1999.
The unilateral declaration of Kosovo's independence will cause a chain reaction of destabilisation in the Western Balkans and a negative precedent for many international issues.
We must base a solution on international law, in a way favouring neither the politics of divide and rule, nor local nationalist and expansionist ideas, nor changes to borders.
We believe that it is still possible to find a mutually acceptable solution within the framework of the UN, based on international law.
We are therefore in favour of continued negotiations.
in writing. - It is unfortunate that the European Union stands divided on the issue of Kosovo.
The European Union has taken a longstanding commitment to secure stability in the Western Balkans and, as the most influential supranational organisation of the continent, we need to convey a clear message and speak with one voice.
Peace and security in Kosovo ought to be a priority for the Union, since it neighbours the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a candidate country to the EU, and we should play a leading role as a mediator between Serbia and Kosovo.
It will not be an easy task, when there is no agreement in the Union, whether to recognise the independence of Kosovo in corpore or not.
Current indecisive behaviour of the Union creates only more confusion in Kosovo.
The Member States need to find a way through their differences in order to start carrying out our commitment to the region.
in writing. - (HU) I was in PriÅ¡tina myself on Sunday.
It is a rare thing for us to be present when a country declares its independence.
I intended my presence to be a message: even if this decision is painful for many, it was announced in circumstances where we were not afraid.
Independence was announced in the hotel where, years ago, guests were welcomed by the following sign above the door: 'Entry prohibited to dogs and Albanians'.
The process leading up to Kosovo's independence was not instigated by the EU.
Serbia started it by not guaranteeing fundamental human rights, individual and community rights to its citizens living in that territory.
The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (DAHR) takes the view that Romania should recognise Kosovo's independence as soon as possible.
Those who are reluctant to acknowledge the situation perhaps have unfinished business with the minorities in their own country.
Since its inception, the DAHR has wanted and still wants to fight for the rights of Transylvanian Hungarians using only political and parliamentary means, and rejecting violent means.
It may now become clear to everyone that the question of the individual and collective rights of traditional national minorities cannot merely be an internal issue for a country.
It is time to draw up a standardised agreement in the European Union (EU) that applies compulsorily to everyone and reassures minorities.
The main duty of the European Union is to offer help to stabilise the region in the areas of economy and social development, not only to Kosovo and Serbia but to the whole western Balkan region.
in writing. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bid Kosovo a heartfelt welcome as one of the countries of Europe.
The declaration of independence was a brave act on Kosovo's part.
Now the country and its people need to show the same courage and self-assurance as they start to build their own multicultural society.
It has been obvious for a long time now that the struggle for Kosovo's independence was a one-way street.
It was only a question of time.
The deadline for independence would have been Serbia's accession to the European Union.
Fortunately, they did not need to wait that long.
Kosovo has been under UN administration now for 10 years.
The situation is completely different from what it has been in other separatist regions.
The years to come will require far-sightedness and wisdom on the part of Kosovo's leaders.
I believe they will show those qualities.
War, ethnic hatred and an administration run by the international community are experiences from which lessons have to be learnt.
The most important thing now is to focus on building a stable civil society.
Independence also removes the uncertainty which has kept both domestic and foreign investments away.
Mr Ahtisaari's plan provides an excellent framework for the initial stages in the country's independence.
Success will only be possible if the leaders and the people perceive the building of their country as their very own project, and not as a set of rules and regulations dictated to them from abroad.
The international community also needs to be able to keep a distance and let the country's Kosovan and Serb populations build their own model of coexistence.
There are almost as many examples of multicultural countries as there are European states.
Kosovo is no exception where this is concerned.
Once again I offer my congratulations to the Kosovans and welcome them as a newly independent country.
in writing. - (HU) Kosovo's declaration of independence is making big waves in our region.
The Romanian parties that are currently preparing for elections are using the occasion to create anti-Hungarian hysteria.
They are all lining up against Hungarians in Transylvania, which is similar in size to Kosovo and has a similar population to the Albanian province.
The 'deep concern' of the Romanian parliament is completely unfounded and unjustified.
Romania must not be afraid of the Hungarians.
Our national community in Transylvania does respect the Romanian constitution and territorial integrity.
At the same time, however, we have reason to expect that, based on the principle of 'territorial rights', Romania will deal with the situation of our national community in a European way, and ensure the personal autonomy of Hungarians (1) and the regional autonomy of Transylvania and other regions (2) on the basis of the principle of self-governance that applies in the European Union.
In line with Council of Europe Recommendation 1609/2003, based on the Gross report, we admit that autonomous regions largely promote conflict resolution and reinforce the stability of Europe.
At the same time, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that Romania itself may also benefit from the new situation since the autonomy model of the Kosovan Serbs may also provide a solution for the Romanian communities living across the border in Serbia and Ukraine.
Taking all this into account, it would be advisable for Romania not to subordinate its amicable settlement to ethno-political prejudice, but to recognise the independent Kosovo as soon as possible, like most other Member States of the Union.
in writing. - (HU) I welcome the European Union's active participation and assumption of responsibility in looking for a solution for Kosovo.
I acknowledge my satisfaction that the Kosovan parliament has assumed the responsibility for Kosovo to respect the principles of democracy, equality of citizens and protection of minorities.
I hope that solidarity will develop among the Member States of the Union, in the interests of assuming an effective role in Kosovo.
Solidarity among the Member States of the EU in connection with Kosovo must manifest itself in the Member States recognising the independence of Kosovo as soon as possible.
The European Union must support Kosovo in its endeavours to become a European democratic state.
I welcome the fact that the Union will continue to guarantee its emphatic presence, since in this way the Union can contribute directly to stability in the Western Balkan region.
I am sure that the Serbian minority in Kosovo will fully guarantee the individual and collective rights necessary for them to stay in the land of their birth.
The European Union's assumption of responsibility in Kosovo is exemplary.
We know that the situation of every European minority is unique, so there are no general solutions, but the Union must play a part in ensuring the individual and collective rights of minority communities, using its influence to reinforce the effectiveness of democratic dialogue and political agreement between the majority and the minority.
It is crucial for the minority communities living in the Member States that legal regulation of the protection of minorities in the Union be established.
Seventh Human Rights Council of the United Nations (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Seventh Human Rights Council of the United Nations.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I am pleased to have been given an opportunity to talk to you about the Human Rights Council.
By placing this item on the agenda for the plenary, the European Parliament has confirmed the importance that Europe as a whole gives to the Human Rights Council.
It is a central, global body for the protection of human rights.
The European Union is a firm advocate of an effective Human Rights Council.
We have worked very hard to ensure that, in its final form, it offers a firm basis for a fast and efficient response to the most serious human rights violations.
As we know, in December last year the final institutional package for the Human Rights Council was adopted and now is the time for the Council to be fully operational.
The sixth session of the Council which took place in September and December last year produced many important results, which I am not going to list here.
It is our ambition to continue this work at the seventh and eighth working sessions.
The seventh session will take place next month and it will be very busy.
Together with the eighth session, to take place in the first two weeks of June, it is to debate the extension of 25 special rapporteurs' mandates, regular reports by special rapporteurs and several disturbing human rights situations in some countries with regard to certain topics.
From the point of view of the European Union, the extension of mandates for the special rapporteurs for Burma/Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea, and Somalia is of crucial importance for the seventh session of the Human Rights Council.
In addition, the European Union will use every opportunity offered by the Council to draw attention to the worrying state of human rights in other places around the world.
To that effect it will get involved in interactive dialogues with individual special rapporteurs and with the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Interactive dialogues are a significant new instrument of the Council, and the European Union will continue striving to consolidate it as one of the key means offered by regular Council sessions to address individual issues.
Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, for the period of its Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Slovenia has listed intercultural dialogue as one of its priorities.
Therefore, we are pleased that this issue will also be given due attention at the seventh session of the Human Rights Council.
The invitation sent to the High Representative of the Alliance of Civilisations, Mr Sampaio, to attend the session indicates an enhanced awareness that the activities of the Alliance of Civilisations help to strengthen religious tolerance, which is also one of the European Union's priorities in the human rights area.
Allow me to present another very important development within the framework of the Human Rights Council, namely the introduction of a universal periodic review, to which the European Union attaches great importance.
This instrument should offer a means of reviewing the human rights situation in all the Member States under the same conditions.
Members of the European Union which will already be subject to this mechanism by the spring (April and May) are currently making thorough preparations for this review.
We will strive for maximum transparency and efficiency in that process.
The method by which this periodic review is going to be conducted will have a significant effect on the credibility of the Human Rights Council as a whole.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to address Parliament on the subject of the Seventh Session of the Human Rights Council.
Let me start by putting the Human Rights Council in what I believe to be the appropriate context.
I have said this before, but it is important to keep it in mind: the Council is a work in progress.
This becomes clear when one looks at the past year and a half of its activities.
Despite a rocky start, with deep divisions over the Lebanon crisis and a negotiating environment which continues to be difficult for the European Union, important results have been achieved.
I am thinking here, particularly, of the innovation of human rights pledges submitted by candidates for election; the ability to hold special sessions on urgent human rights situations, a far cry from the annual ritual of its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights; the development of 'interactive dialogues' with UN special procedures, a very public means of focusing attention on human rights violations; and, finally, the adoption of the all-important institution-building package by consensus.
The President of the Council, Ambasador Costea, was in Brussels last week to brief the Council and Parliament on preparations for the Seventh Session.
He described the Council as being 'better than expected and worse than hoped for'.
This may sound cynical, perhaps reflecting the reality of day-to-day UN work, but I think it also sets the tone accurately.
There is both good and bad in the Council, but it is making progress and is, therefore, on the right path.
Priorities for the Seventh Session fall between addressing urgent human rights situations effectively - increasingly, the standard by which the Council should be judged - and continuing to implement the institution-building reforms. On the human rights situation, effective follow-up to the special session on Burma/Myanmar is paramount.
Amongst other priorities, the human rights violations in Sri Lanka and Kenya should also be addressed in this session.
Implementing the institutional reforms is, arguably, just as important, given their impact on the future success of the Council.
Here, agreeing criteria for the election of members of the Advisory Committee and the transparent appointment of suitably qualified candidates for the special procedure mandates to be renewed are key concerns of the Seventh Session.
Finally, let me make a couple of comments on the universal periodic review, or the UPR, as it is known.
The President reported this week that the states under review in the April and May sessions are taking their responsibilities seriously.
I hope so.
The early sessions of the UPR are likely to set the tone for the remainder.
It is, therefore, vital that the EU Member States being reviewed lead the way with frank critiques of their human rights records.
This should be no beauty pageant.
Furthermore, I see an important role for the European Union in the 'outcome sessions' of the UPR.
The UPR is, more than anything else, about the international community cooperating with states under review to achieve concrete human rights improvements after a genuine self-analysis of failings and needs.
The European Commission and the Member States should not be slow in offering technical assistance where it is merited in these outcome sessions.
To do so would show our genuine commitment to the promotion of human rights in an important public setting.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, Parliament is sending a delegation to the Seventh Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.
The delegation will be mandated to voice Parliament's concerns on the HRC's work and will report to the Subcommittee on Human Rights during its visit.
We see the Seventh Session of the HRC as a crucial one, because it will be the first to examine a large range of substantial issues under the new working methods stemming from the institution-building reforms package adopted in 2006 and 2007.
The credibility of the HRC rests on the implementation of these reforms and mechanisms, and our goal is to strengthen the Council's ability to address human rights violations around the world, especially the most urgent ones.
We pay tribute to the positive results of the HRC, in particular the developments in the implementation of the universal periodic review, and the review of special procedures, as well as to the positive achievements of the Human Rights Council Presidency.
We welcome the participation of civil society and human rights defenders, as well as the special procedures, which are at the core of the UN human rights machinery, and play a critical role, especially in the Human Rights Council.
At the same time, we condemn certain decisions of the Human Rights Council, such as that not to renew the mandates of the special rapporteurs on Belarus and Cuba.
Taking into account the lessons of the past, we stress the importance of competitive elections being held in all regions, in order to provide real choice among UN members.
The reason is that, to our regret, some countries with problematic human rights records have so far been elected.
Once again, I call on the Council, Commission and Member States to continue to press for the establishment of membership criteria for election to the United Nations Human Rights Council, including the issuing of permanent invitations for special procedures.
Speaking about EU involvement, we recognise the active role of the EU and its Member States in the first year of work of the HRC.
It is very important for the EU to speak with one voice when addressing human rights issues, and we call on the Commission and Council to adopt a common position so as to ensure EU Member States automatically sign and ratify all international human rights instruments.
Last but not least, the EU should make more effective use of aid and political support to the countries in question so as to give them incentives to cooperate with the Human Rights Council.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, the United Nations Human Rights Council is one of the most interesting areas in the field of human rights for the European Parliament.
We closely monitor the activities of that Council, and the European Parliament sends its missions to Geneva twice a year.
I would like to make three remarks.
First, I would like to pay tribute to the positive achievements of the Council Presidency and, at the same time, I would like to stress the importance of support from the European Union and, equally, of candidates with high standards of integrity for the elections of the new President of the Council, to be held on 23 June 2008.
Second, I would like to stress that special procedures are at the core of the United Nations human rights machinery, playing a critical role, especially in the Human Rights Council, civil society and democratic states.
In particular, the EU States need to monitor and pressure Council members to fulfil their responsibilities to promote human rights.
The European Parliament has to condemn the Council decisions not to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteurs on Belarus and Cuba.
We should welcome the renewal of the country mandates of the Special Rapporteur on Sudan and of the independent experts on Liberia, Haiti and Burundi.
Third, much legitimate criticism of the Council centres on its disappointing treatment of specific country situations.
Particularly one-sided international sympathy for the Palestinian cause and the agonised efforts of Islamic states led the Council to address the Middle East conflict, but there was repeated criticism of only one state - Israel - ignoring violations by Hezbollah and some Palestinian factions.
The challenge is to build the political will for the Council members to effectively address such a situation in a just manner.
, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, on the eve of the Seventh Human Rights Council, Parliament wishes to send a message of support, vigilance and mobilisation.
The Council is the only international body that actually fights human rights violations, and particularly that responds to emergencies, to human rights crises, but also that works long term with the special rapporteurs and in an interactive dialogue with NGOs.
The Council is unique and is at a difficult turning point in its history.
One year will not be enough to establish its effectiveness.
On the other hand, it may be enough to discredit it, and there have been many attempts to weaken and divert it, as we know.
I would first like to mention the situation of Mrs Sigma Huda, Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons.
She is in prison in deplorable conditions in Bangladesh.
Next, concerning these same special rapporteurs, the Advisory Committee's proposals will finally be decided by the President as a last resort.
That gives you an idea of just how important his role is, and I would like to salute the excellence of the work done by President Costea, and at the same time draw your attention to the fact that he will be replaced in June.
That is why the EU has to remain attentive and proactive.
Its action is decisive.
We saw it in Gaza.
The EU's abstention waters down the message considerably, and weakens the Council itself.
However, when the EU takes the initiative of a special session and throws its whole weight behind it, the Council grows and achieves results.
To do this, our Member States need to strengthen their transregional alliances to convince others and prevent any block reaction that would send the Council back into the throes of political contingencies.
We therefore call upon our governments to step up their efforts and set an example.
Set an example by appointing an independent expert when they participate in the assessment of another government as part of the UPR and by themselves being open to criticism and self-criticism, and set an example for the election of new members.
A standing invitation to the special procedures should be a criterion of prime importance for EU Member States.
Mr President, I commend this resolution to you.
Indeed, I commend the work of the Parliament's delegation to Geneva where, as well as holding our own EU representatives to account, we work with them to engage in dialogue with countries in other regions of the world, demonstrating Europe's strength and solidarity in upholding human rights and international humanitarian law.
I am grateful for the inclusion of my amendments in the text supporting the call for a special session on violence against women and for the signature and ratification by all our countries of all international human rights instruments.
I call for Europe's support, in particular, for the renewal of the mandate of the Special Representative on Business and Human Rights.
But having just returned from Gaza, I would like to commend to you paragraph 34 in particular.
This is a state of siege, with mediaeval conditions being imposed on the people of Gaza.
Today we will identify it as a clear breach of human rights.
If even Tony Blair cannot get Israel to allow the import of equipment to stop 40 000 litres of untreated human waste poisoning the water supply, it is time for Europe to act.
European troops under a new mandate could help supervise the reopening of the borders and, as I now ask for your support, European countries can achieve agreement on all sides in the UN Human Rights Council to seek enforcement of international humanitarian law.
We, as Europe, can take the initiative, as was suggested by the Slovenian Presidency at our Human Rights Subcommittee in Brussels only last week.
We can propose a balanced text that recognises that both terrorist rocket attacks as well as the collective punishment of the blockade both break the fourth Geneva Convention.
In doing so, we can achieve a consensus in Geneva which can make a real difference to the humanitarian crisis suffered by the people of Gaza.
(FI) Mr President, a critical examination of the old mechanisms and ways of working and the establishment of new practices have inspired much hope in the ability of the Human Rights Council to act as an effective body which focuses on how human rights violations are dealt with and allows political situations to fall clearly within the competence of the UN bodies.
The credibility of the Human Rights Council also depends on the new special procedure mandate holders who are to be appointed in March.
It is hugely important that expertise, impartiality, independence and objectivity are the crucial factors.
Like many others here, in the current situation I too would like the decision of the Human Rights Council not to extend the mandates of the special rapporteurs on Belarus and Cuba to be reconsidered.
The EU Member States should also try to guarantee that the mandate of the independent expert on the Democratic Republic of Congo is extended.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I would like to thank the Members who took part in this debate and offered their opinions, which will undoubtedly help the Presidency of the Council in its preparations for the seventh session of the Human Rights Council.
I would like to stress in particular that I strongly agree with the statement by Mrs Andrikienregarding the need for the European Union to appear unified, speaking with one voice, at the Human Rights Council.
I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the Presidency is also hoping for good cooperation with the European Parliament delegation.
The importance of the European Union's role in the promotion and protection of human rights is indisputable, which is why we would like to have the best possible cooperation of this revered assembly.
I would like to end by saying that the seventh session of the Human Rights Council will start with the meeting of ministers, which will be addressed, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, by the President of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, Minister Dimitrij Rupel.
A number of other high representatives, perhaps even the Secretary-General of the United Nations, will be taking part.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the European Union is a very important body that has to go in the right direction and lead the Human Rights Council in that direction.
The Council has yet to prove itself as an effective human rights organ within the United Nations; that much is clear.
However, as I said before, it is too early to pass a final judgment.
Indeed, to do that at this stage might even hinder its future progress.
That is why it is important that the human rights community continues to support the Human Rights Council, albeit with a critical eye.
In that vein, I am pleased that a delegation of the European Parliament will be attending part of the Seventh Session to assess its work at first hand.
Like Ms AndrikienÄ, I think that the European Union will have to strive to speak with one voice on this issue.
Voting patterns of EU members on the Council are very harmonised, and the more harmonised they are, the more important our voice will be.
Concerning the criteria for membership, so far it has proved impossible to draw up such criteria.
However, the pledges on human rights commitments will be important steps towards more responsibility for the candidate countries and, as I have said before, this is an important step.
Concerning the special procedures, the EU is fighting actively to extend existing mandates and establish the new ones we deem necessary.
Finally, let me say a word on Belarus and Cuba.
The Council can be criticised for not continuing the mandates for those countries, but this was a compromise made necessary to save many of the other country and thematic mandates that are currently being reviewed.
Similarly, for instance on Sudan.
It is regrettable to lose the mandate of the Expert Group on Darfur, but this was unfortunately unavoidable in order to save that of the Special Representative on Sudan.
Therefore, in order to achieve consensus, the European Union sometimes has to be prepared to make difficult compromises.
But, again, on the whole, we are a very strong motor and body in this area, and we have to go on working to ensure that the Human Rights Council really works and goes in the right direction.
The European Parliament is a very, very strong tool to help us on that path.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 21 February 2008.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B6-0010/2008).
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Subject: Immigration in the wake of the EU-Africa summit
Can the Council provide information on the measures proposed for adoption in order to implement the agreements reached at the recent summit held in Lisbon between the EU and the countries of Africa on the subject of immigration?
President-in-Office of the Council. - It was agreed at the EU-Africa summit held on 9 December last year in Lisbon to establish a strategic partnership which would encompass all areas and issues of mutual interest.
I would especially like to draw your attention to three important documents which were adopted at that summit: the Lisbon Declaration, the EU-Africa Joint Strategy and its First Action Plan.
This First Action Plan of the Joint Strategy establishes a partnership between Africa and the European Union in the supplementary fields of migration, mobility and employment.
The partnership between Africa and the European Union in the areas of migration, mobility and employment should ensure comprehensive responses to these issues with the specific aim of creating more and better jobs for Africans and better control of migration.
At the moment, the competent bodies of the Council are studying further measures that will need to be undertaken on the basis of the decisions of the Lisbon summit and on the basis of the EU-Africa Joint Strategy and its First Action Plan, including the partnership in the area of migration.
(ES) Madam President, the question is: what type of measures can be taken effectively, because the migratory pressure on Europe is still very high, as a result of the distressing social and economic situation in many African countries.
The specific question that I wanted to ask was whether, in fact, the Council currently has any concrete plan, because time is marching on, the situation in Africa is not improving and, in particular, many European countries are complaining of uncontrolled immigration and of the inability of the European institutions to control it.
What are we actually doing at the moment?
What can we expect in the short term?
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr Medina Ortega, the problems you were mentioning will not be resolved in a short period of time.
The situation in Africa in the fields of economic development, security and peoples' welfare are of such dimensions that the time span for their resolution can only be long-term.
A long-term easing of migratory pressures can only achieved with improved living conditions on the African continent.
The summit could not offer answers to all the issues; in particular, it could not offer quick solutions.
As I have mentioned, the summit took place in December and debates on the measures to be adopted for implementation of the agreements reached at the summit are only just starting now.
I can say that the EU-Africa summit established a framework for all the talks on migration management which have been conducted at several conferences between Africa and the European Union.
The EU-Africa summit now integrates the Tripoli process, the Rabat process and all the other processes.
This is the first achievement, the consolidation of our efforts.
I would like to mention the essential feature of the European Union's policy on migration in relation to Africa.
We are primarily striving for a global approach.
This is an approach which includes the fight against illegal migration, efforts to improve the management of legal migration, prevention of human trafficking, better border controls and, above all, development of the countries from which such migration originates.
Only this development will provide a long-term solution to the migratory pressures facing the European Union.
The other measures I have already listed are at best short-term solutions that will not eradicate the essential problem which you yourself mentioned, the problem of the conditions prevailing in the countries of origin.
That is the essential driving force behind migration.
(DE) I salute the way you are looking at the big picture here and distinguishing between medium- and long-term strategies.
You referred to a summit coming up soon.
Are you, as President-in-Office of the Council, prepared to call for an agreement by the relevant states in Africa on the readmission of illegal immigrants as a condition for positive cooperation, for more economic assistance and more assistance of other types?
President-in-Office of the Council. - The Council's policy on the return of illegal immigrants is well-known.
It is one of the constituent parts of the European Union's migration policy that is being implemented with our African partners.
Development aid is also an aspect of migration policy, that is to say it must be taken into account, and immigration policy should be viewed from that perspective too because it addresses the long-term problem of creating better conditions in the countries from which the migration originates.
Frankly, I do not wish to speak about the direct application of conditions on development aid in relation to these aspects.
It is a fact, however, that they are elements of the whole migration policy, which are still to be linked together and strengthened in the future.
(DE) President-in-Office, if there is one area in which people in Europe want the European Union to shoulder responsibility, it is the area of illegal immigration and immigration policy as a whole.
Although, in my opinion, Parliament and the Commission are very active in this area, I am not so sure about the Council.
You said that everyone knows what the Council is doing on this matter.
I know what it is doing - and that is to do all it can to prevent the creation of vitally important European competences.
That is what it has been doing for years.
I would be interested to know what makes you so optimistic that anything will change and what concrete measures you are putting in place to bring about change.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I should say in response to Mr Moraes' question that the inter-institutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management has defined the financial framework for the European Union and the 27 Member States for the period between 2007 and 2013.
This interinstitutional agreement was adopted in May.
In July 2007 the legislative package on cohesion policy was adopted on the basis of that agreement.
In short, after the enlargement in January 2007, there was no need for a reallocation of resources.
You spoke about the wider analysis of structural funding, but you may be aware that, last week, Eurostat published figures which showed which were the richest areas in the European Union and the richest cities.
These included my own constituency of London, yet I live in a part of London which ranks among some of the poorest areas in Western Europe in terms of child poverty and so on.
Really, my question to you was: will you continue to take into account the fact that even in the richest areas, like London and Frankfurt, there are still pockets of poverty, which have been left behind, and should not be left behind just because we are quite rightly helping the poorest parts of Europe?
President-in-Office of the Council. - Thank you for this additional question.
I think I now have a better understanding of the original question about the effect of enlargement on regional financing, to which my answer was that there was no effect because the resources had been appropriately allocated before enlargement.
However, the supplementary question is also a reasonable one. The question is whether such phenomena should be handled within the framework of regional policies.
Affluent regions should perhaps be allowed or obliged to do more to eliminate pockets of poverty.
This is probably done more easily by affluent regions than by those less well-off.
In short, we must take into consideration the concept of regional politics and regional resources within the framework of the European Union.
This does not alter the reality of the problem you have pointed out.
(LT) Mr President, Minister, I would like to ask if you have any information, any figures, to show how the growth of GDP has been influenced by structural funding given to new accession countries and maybe even older Member States.
Research carried out in my country, Lithuania, has shown that it was not structural aid, but development of the single market and the internal market that had a major impact on economic growth.
Are you able to supply such figures?
Thank you.
President-in-Office of the Council. - No, honourable Member, I have not got those figures with me.
However, I can say two things.
Firstly, the common market benefits all the Member States, both old and new, and everyone else associated with this common market.
There is no doubt about that and it can be seen in the 2006 European Commission report entitled 'Enlargement, two years after', which mentions and evaluates the beneficial effects of the enlarged common market and other aspects.
As regards the Structural Funds, the situation is as follows: What is important is not only the level of resources for a particular purpose within the Structural Funds, but also the quality of application of those resources.
That is how I can maintain that, when applied well, these resources contribute to a higher per capita income in the country in question.
The Minister has had a very long day, so I am just going to suggest that, from the point of view of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, he look at the example of Ireland, where the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund played a major part in transforming a third world economy into what is the Celtic Tiger.
It shows what can be done.
Three out of the four legs under the Celtic Tiger were provided as a result of the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and other funding from the European Union.
We wish the new Member States well, and we wish you well in your presidency.
President-in-Office of the Council. - In December 2007, on the basis of comprehensive studies carried out by European institutions as well as social partners, the Committee adopted decisions on eight common principles relating to 'flexicurity'.
Those principles were also confirmed by the European Council.
The Council noted in these decisions that the common principles should contribute to the implementation of the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy.
Recently, the Commission presented a proposal on integrated guidelines for 2008-2010.
We can expect the Council to devote particular attention to flexicurity in the debates on this proposal, which have already started.
Responsibility for implementing the integrated guidelines will rest with the Member States.
It is expected that, when reporting to the Council and the Commission on the implementation of those guidelines, they will refer to their regulations on flexicurity.
The Council is of the opinion that it is necessary to raise citizens' awareness of flexicurity policies and of the importance of those policies for reforming European economic and social models.
Therefore, in its decision, the Council called on the Commission to instigate a public initiative to enable the relevant interest groups in the labour market to adopt the common principles more easily.
The Council also asked the Commission to keep it regularly informed about the measures in question.
As regards the two important legislative proposals in the field of working conditions - I am talking about the Working Time Directive and the Temporary Employment Directive - the Slovenian Presidency is prepared to continue working on this matter.
In view of the difficulties in reaching unanimity among the Member States, we are still assessing further possible procedures relating to that legislation.
It should be mentioned in this respect that Europe has many and varied traditions in the regulation of working conditions.
The Member States nevertheless managed to agree relatively quickly on the common principles of flexicurity, although they warned that these principles would have to be adapted to the specific conditions in each Member State.
All this indicates that the agreement will be more difficult to reach when looking for a solution in the form of binding legislation applicable to all the labour markets in the Union.
(EL) Madam President, the citizens of every Member State - employers and employees - are subject to pressure with regard to working relations.
In many cases this is certainly due to globalisation, but it is also caused by the open method of coordination that the European Union has been implementing for years.
Thus we are raising objections to the proposals for the reform of insurance systems and to other measures based on this open method of coordination.
Does the Council intend to propose structural measures to improve working relations at European level in order to remove the strong opposition and protests that we see on television in all the Member States?
President-in-Office of the Council. - Of course the Council intends to continue and develop its efforts to improve conditions in the labour market.
It is often said that improved flexibility in the labour market means reduced social security, but this is not so.
The essence of the concept of flexicurity or secure flexibility is precisely that.
The Council is convinced that this is the only correct course in the context of globalisation, which includes many issues.
What matters is not merely increased flexibility in the labour market, which should never be to the detriment of social security; there are a whole number of other measures such as life-long learning, better development of human resources, and other aspects of flexicurity.
In short, the Council intends to continue its activities in this field, and that will be one of the important issues to be debated at the March session of the European Council as par of the impetus for the new phase of the Lisbon Strategy.
(DE) As the word flexicurity suggests, the ideal is a combination of flexibility and security.
This morning there was a debate about this and a suggestion came from Parliament that a minimum wage should be introduced in Member States according to their minimum standards.
What will the Presidency do to guarantee that the minimum wage will in fact be realised in individual Member States within the foreseeable future?
Could I ask you to comment a little more on the point you made when you said that you would want to raise awareness and have a public initiative on this whole flexicurity issue.
My feeling is that workers probably know the 'flexi' part very well, but are less clear on that of security in this new world of work.
And, on the issue of the minimum wage: coming from a country which has a minimum wage, I believe the issue is to make sure everyone is getting a minimum wage.
President-in-Office of the Council. - The process of shaping the forces for the European mission to Chad, which did not go so smoothly, was completed by 11 January this year to the extent that the commander was able to recommend commencement of the operation.
On 28 January the Council confirmed the operation plan, the so-called 'o-plan', and adopted a decision on its commencement.
As we know, the Irish General Patrick Nash is commanding the operation.
The force consists of 3 700 soldiers from 14 Member States.
These forces are composed, equipped and trained to fulfil their mission satisfactorily in a difficult environment.
Their rules on the use of force are strict and in line with the mandate laid down in Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.
As we know, that mandate was given in Resolution 1778 of the United Nations Security Council.
The European Union's operation, known as the EUFOR Chad-Central African Republic operation, will be conducted for one year from the date of declaration of the initial operational capability and will be neutral and impartial.
Planning was executed from the outset in close cooperation with the United Nations.
To ensure transparency, efficiency and the possibility of modifying the measures, appropriate coordination mechanisms have been established at all levels, in New York and Brussels, at operation headquarters in Paris and on the ground.
After recent clashes between government forces and Chadian rebel groups, the security situation in Chad is now more stable.
The deployment of the EU mission is continuing and we expect EUFOR to reach its initial operational capability by mid-March.
Let me mention some decisions adopted by the Council at the last session on Monday, the day before yesterday.
The Council expressed its deep concern regarding the regional ramifications of the conflict in Darfur and attempts of overthrowing the Chadian government.
It backed the African Union and the United Nations' call for the respect of the sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity of Chad.
The Council stated that recent events underscored the need for the deployment of the mission to Eastern Chad, where their task should be to increase security.
The Council has also stressed that, in the observance of its mandate, the mission will be impartial, neutral and independent.
I will finish by adding that the Council will closely follow the security situation in Chad and Western Darfur at all levels and also assess the consequences of this situation for the EUFOR mission.
President-in-Office, you did not answer my question, which was, specifically, if you could give an assurance that the necessary equipment for this difficult mission is available.
Would you please answer that question and give an assurance?
As you said, it is under the command of an Irish Army officer, Lieutenant General Nash, and this evening 50 members of the elite Irish Army Rangers will be leaving Dublin, and will be followed by many more Irish troops in the near future.
Will there be sufficient logistical back-up?
Do they have the medical services they need, and will you give an assurance, as I asked in my question, that all the necessary equipment for this difficult mission is available?
I wish God's speed and protection for the Irish Rangers and all the soldiers who are there, in their difficult task.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I should emphasise that in principle the equipping of units is the responsibility of each individual Member State that is sending units to a mission.
Honourable Member, you are asking about assurances that the Council cannot give, because they are the responsibilities of each individual Member State.
I can only repeat what I said in the introduction, namely that the process of forming of the forces was completed successfully.
It was difficult, but in the end it was successful to the extent that the mission commander recommended that the mission could commence.
(DE) I believe that this mission is a good idea in principle - as long as it is carried out professionally - because it achieves precisely what was addressed in the migration debate we heard earlier, namely creating security where immigrants come from.
Therefore, I simply cannot understand that some hypocritical Austrian right-wing populists are against this mission.
However, what I am concerned about already is that it is a constant topic of discussion whether, in particular, the French army will conduct itself in this mission with neutrality towards the parties in dispute.
I would be interested to know what information you have about this and how you will ensure that the mission remains neutral overall towards all disputing parties.
I would also like to take the opportunity to wish the soldiers there all the best.
I have a question in relation to contact with groups which are opposed to the government.
I am not talking about rebel groups, but other groups which are opposed to the government.
Has any effort been made to bring them on board, so that we have a more unified approach to the UN mission that is going into Chad, or the European Union mission that is going into Chad?
All contact so far seems to be with the government itself.
I wonder if the way forward might not be to get people on board who may be opposed to the government, but who are not involved in rebel groups.
President-in-Office of the Council. - I should mention from the outset that on 6 November last year, the European Union High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, appointed a Special Envoy for Burma/Myanmar to highlight the importance which the European Union attaches to democratic change, reconciliation, improvement of human rights and development of the country.
Under this mandate, the Special Envoy, Mr Fassino, has asked for a meeting with the United Nations Special Adviser, Mr Gambari, and has also consulted the key partners of the European Union.
In November last year, in the margins of the EU-ASEAN Summit in Singapore, the Special Envoy met the representative of the ASEAN countries.
In December he also went on his first mission to China.
He met the representatives of Burma and its neighbours in Rome and during visits to the United Nations in Geneva and New York, and he will also be meeting their representatives in Brussels.
These consultations and political and diplomatic contacts made by our Special Representative will continue in the coming months.
Particular attention will be paid to mediation by the United Nations and the United Nations 'Group of Friends'.
At the session on Monday, the General Affairs and External Relations Council welcomed the work of the Special Envoy, Mr Fassino, in coordinating the diplomatic efforts of the European Union and its Asian partners and reaffirmed his role in supporting and promoting the United Nations mission.
I should point out that, some time ago, the European Union adopted an overall common position which includes an arms embargo on Burma and travel restrictions and the freezing of assets for a large number of Burmese citizens connected with the military and the government.
In November 2007 the Council adopted stricter sanctions to reinforce the existing measures and to set up new ones, especially measures aimed at extractive activities.
As anticipated, the Council will study the effect, efficiency, political suitability and practical feasibility of possible further restrictions.
The Council receives and studies information from its partners and many representatives in governmental organisations about their experience with the stricter sanctions.
The Council has noted that some Member States of the European Union and the Commission have recently increased aid to Burma and Burmese refugees in neighbouring countries.
The European Union would be prepared to guarantee additional aid to Burma/Myanmar.
For that reason it is calling for the Burmese authorities to adopt further measures to democratise the country and reach national reconciliation.
The official announcement of a referendum on the constitution, which should take place in May of this year, and in particular of multi-party elections in 2010, is, in the opinion of the Council, a step in the right direction.
This is just a follow-up to your response to this very complicated matter, which I much appreciate.
I would just like to raise two related issues.
Firstly, the General-Secretary of the KNU was assassinated in his home in Thailand on 14 February.
I understand that Christian Solidarity Worldwide had visited him two days earlier.
What pressure have we placed on Thailand to investigate that murder?
I understand that the assassination was ordered by the regime in Burma.
Secondly, my understanding is that refugees coming into Malaysia have been quite badly treated.
In fact, some refugees gave birth while in custody or in prison.
What pressure we have put on both Thailand and Malaysia in relation to dealing with these issues?
President-in-Office of the Council. - As I mentioned in the previous answer, the Council is following the situation in Burma/Myanmar closely and is receiving reports from various sources.
The EU, together with other countries, responded to the demonstrations of last August and September and to the violent suppression of those peaceful demonstrations, with the clear aim of displaying its solidarity with the Burmese population.
Also, it adopted stronger restrictive measures targeting those responsible for violence and the general political deadlock and conditions in the country.
As mentioned before, because of the difficult living conditions of the population and because of the numbers of refugees, some Member States and the Commission have increased aid to Burma as well as to Burmese refugees in neighbouring countries.
In addition, the European Union was among the instigators of the United Nations Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva in October 2007, which authorised the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights, SÃ©rgio Pinheiro, to visit Burma/Myanmar and investigate the violent suppression of the September demonstrations and the alleged killings and disappearances following the events.
The European Union fully supports Professor Pinheiro's recommendations in his December report and regularly calls on the authorities in Burma to implement them.
The EU has approached the Burmese authorities on many occasions.
It is also attempting to utilise meetings with Burma/Myanmar at multilateral forums to call on the authorities to begin an inclusive and overall process of reconciliation and political reforms, to eliminate the limitations imposed on Aung San Suu Kyi, to release political prisoners and to improve access for international organisations, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The EU has presented these opinions to Burma's neighbours and stressed the urgent need to improve the situation in that country.
As I have mentioned, the announcement of a referendum on the constitution and multi-party elections in 2010 has given some hope.
(GA) Mr President, I welcome the response of the President-in-Office of the Council.
He said in answer to my colleague, Colm de BÃºrca's question that he wanted Burma to be more democratic.
As regards that, I would like to ask a question about the new Constitution: is it not true that this document was drafted without the involvement of the leader of the main democratic opposition party, Aung San Suu Kyi?
That is in no way satisfactory.
And is it not evident, that the army and the armed forces will keep a tight hold on or control power?
Another important question: Will there be any independent monitoring on the part of the EU or the United Nations as regards the referendum and the Constitution?
President-in-Office of the Council. - Mrs McGuinness probably already knows that on 11 December last year the Council and the European Parliament adopted a directive to amend the Television without Frontiers Directive and rename it the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.
The first recital of the new, amended directive explains that it is necessary to amend the directive because of the development of new technologies and their impact on business models, especially the financing of commercial broadcasting.
The aim of the new directive is to find answers to these technological changes by introducing some new, technically neutral, terminology-based definitions that will enable them to be used not only for the current services, but also for those forms of service yet to be developed, such as audiovisual media services and services on demand.
To satisfy this future capability, we think that the directive regulating the audiovisual sector should be valid for a few years to come.
Pursuant to this directive, and not later than 19 December 2011 and every three years thereafter, the Commission must prepare a report of the application of the directive and, if necessary, make further proposals for its adaptation, especially in respect of new technological developments.
As regards junk food advertising for children, the European Parliament and the Council agree that this issue could be dealt with most effectively if the providers of audiovisual media services were to develop codes of conduct.
For this purpose, the second paragraph of Article 3(e) of the amended directive includes a requirement that all Member States and the Commission encourage media service providers to develop such codes.
You have answered the first part of my question very fulsomely, and I thank you for that.
On the second part, perhaps what we need is a code of conduct that is effective, because we have many codes of conduct on paper, and they are not effective.
I would ask perhaps that you make a statement in relation to when we review codes of conduct and see that they are not having an effect, will we take tougher action?
I think we may need to.
President-in-Office of the Council. - The essence of a code of conduct is precisely that it is developed by the providers themselves.
However, it is clear that if the codes are inadequate and do not meet the needs, neither the Council nor the Commission will be satisfied.
That is why my answer to your question is basically that the Council and the Commission must persist at least until the providers have developed effective codes of conduct.
President-in-Office, could I direct you to another matter in terms of the protection of children in the context of media, in particular against the background of rising and alarming suicide rates in Europe, not least in my own constituency?
This is, what can the Council do in respect of the gross misuse, in particular via internet services, of readily available advice on how to commit suicide?
I today downloaded information from one such site, which gave multiple advice on how to commit suicide.
It is quite appalling.
Even if one goes onto Wikipedia one can find information on how to commit suicide.
Will the Council address that in the context of child protection, in particular in the context of media?
(DE) My question relates to the telecommunications package presented by the Commission, where new opportunities for television arise as a result of the digital dividends, i.e. through the use of the digital spectrum of frequency allocation.
Do you see a need to modify the Television Directive based on the new technical regulations?
President-in-Office of the Council. - In view of the problem pointed out by Mr Allister and the cases which should be condemned and require action, I should mention that, even prior to being amended, the directive contained a ban on advertising anything harmful to health.
It also banned communications that may cause physical or moral detriment to minors.
I think those definitions also cover the cases mentioned.
I should also say that the amendment to the directive was published last December and the Member States have two years to incorporate it into their internal law.
As regards the 'telecom' package, I find it difficult to answer the question, which requires a more detailed analysis of the need for changes.
However, this question has been discussed.
The legislative package relating to telecommunications is being debated at the moment.
Your question will be forwarded to the Council.
I am in no doubt that if a change has to be introduced, it will be.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Madam President, I would just like to thank the services for very promptly acting upon the information that I sent them to accurately record my actual voting intention.
That has now been done, so I would like, through you, to forward my thanks to them for acting as efficiently as they have done.
The public record now shows my actual voting intention.
I am obliged to you.
(The sitting was suspended at 19.05 and resumed at 21.00)
The demographic future of Europe (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Castex, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the demographic future of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are continuing this evening began within these walls several years ago.
It will not end with the adoption of this report, which still leaves some questions unanswered, and which we will undoubtedly have to come back to in the near future.
In any case, I would like to thank the Commission for the quality of its communication, which has enriched the debate, and we have benefited from it in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
In my report, I develop the consequences of demographic change, i.e. the shrinking of the active population, the growing number of elderly people, and the demographic imbalances between different regions of Europe.
Is this to say it is impossible to act on the causes?
I would first like to remind you that the 20th century saw two vast changes.
Firstly, women gained access to education and training on the same footing as men.
Secondly, women gained control over their reproductive lives through contraception.
These are two factors of women's emancipation.
They mark great, and I hope irreversible, progress for humanity.
However, to have all the information for analysis at hand, two other things need to be added as well.
All the studies show that European citizens would like more children than they actually have, and secondly, in Member States where the employment rate among women is high, the birth rate is also high.
An active working life therefore does not prevent people from having children, provided that there is reconciliation of work life and family life for everyone, men and women alike.
There is still a lot of progress to be made in this area, in all Member States.
Another point arose during our discussions, one that nobody essentially disputes.
Economic insecurity and fear of the future are important factors behind the drop in the birth rate.
When it is difficult to plan for the future, people hesitate to have children.
This is a key point, and I think that the drop in birth rate recorded in the European Union is a serious warning from this point of view.
To regain confidence in the future, our citizens need their job security and dignified living conditions restored.
Enough of the causes, what about the consequences?
The main consequence is a reduction in the active population, falling from 331 million in 2010 to around 268 million by 2050.
How can we maintain Europe's growth and competitiveness with a tiny active population?
This is where the title of the communication takes on real meaning, Commissioner, and real force: turning a challenge into an opportunity.
Europe still has some very high unemployment rates today, and the margin for progress in the employment of women, young people and older people, for whom the employment rate drops dramatically from the age of 52-55 years, remains great.
Is not the real opportunity of this demographic challenge, the objective of full employment, which is finally realistic, finally achievable and finally necessary?
To achieve it we must implement a genuine human resources management policy and a real lifelong training policy.
I say lifelong with reason, for that also means for employees over 50 who, along with other types of discrimination, also have to face discrimination on training and on promotion at work.
In my report, I put forward the concept of the active life-cycle to stress the need to consider a period of active life of around forty years - though it is up to the Member States to decide - of continuous employment, training, requalification, potential promotion, from the beginning to the end of a person's active life.
Before considering raising the retirement age, it is necessary to make sure that everyone below that age is able to work, to exploit their skills and professional experience.
It is because there is a legal retirement age that people can think of going beyond it, depending on the arrangements defined by each Member State in line with its traditions of dialogue and consultation.
On this point, the debate remains open.
The last point I would like to mention quickly is of course the use of immigration.
There is much discussion of it making up for the drop in the active population, but immigration also stirs up a great deal of tension, as you know.
For this reason I recommend a clear and reasoned approach to this issue.
Immigration is not a new phenomenon in the European Union and, with a positive balance of two million immigrants per year - a figure that has been stable for several years - legal immigration contributes to the composition of the active population of the European Union, just as it contributes to the composition of European society.
We need to maintain this flow of immigrants and guarantee a legal status in our Member States for those we welcome, in particular fighting illegal immigration and the exploitation of illegal workers.
The human dimension of immigration must govern our policies on the subject and family integration should not disappear from our guidelines.
In a provisional conclusion to this presentation, I would like to recall that, behind the average birth rates, the age pyramids and the ratios lie the issues of birth, motherhood, the place of women in society, the care we give to our elderly and the way we ourselves wish to end our lives.
That is the reason why this debate is as interesting as it is impassioned, and I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for taking as much interest in this as I have.
Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all the Members of the European Parliament and above all the rapporteur, Mrs Castex, for her informative report on the Commission communication on the demographic future of Europe.
I am particularly pleased by the fact that besides the Committee on Employment there were four other parliamentary committees dealing with this report: the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and the Committee on Regional Development.
This clearly gives the Member States a stronger political signal and indicates the importance of demographic issues in Europe today.
The European Parliament's analysis of the main demographic issues is to a great extent in line with the conclusions of the Commission's 2007 report.
Both agree that ageing and declining birth rates are the result of social and economic development.
Moreover, both Parliament and the Commission share the view that it is possible to respond to these phenomena constructively and successfully.
Demographic changes present not only serious challenges but also new opportunities.
The report points out, however, that it is important to respond both to the challenges and the opportunities now.
It is encouraging to see that the political response and measures outlined in the report more or less correspond to the Commission's proposals.
Family policy is the sole responsibility of individual Member States.
However, as the report rightly states, the European Union also a role has a role to play.
The revised Lisbon Strategy provides a framework for modernising family policy through support for equal opportunities and above all support for initiatives aimed at attaining a better work/life balance.
In this regard, we are happy to see the new European Alliance for Families, which was established at the European Council meeting in spring 2007.
This Alliance represents another platform at EU level for the exchange of experience among Member States.
The report also rightly emphasises the changing relationship between the working and non-working sectors, stressing that the Member States will have to take all possible measures to deal with future shortages of workers in the labour market.
They must first and foremost increase the participation in the labour market of young people, women and older people.
There are a number of specific steps, which can and must be taken.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me mention migration briefly once again as it is such an important and sensitive area.
It is quite clear that inward and outward migration are part and parcel of European history and the European way of life.
It is vital to support integration from the start, rather than seeing migration solely as a security or policing issue.
Migration is part of our European way of life and for the most part has positive and necessary effects for us all.
In conclusion, I would like to mention the issue of infertility.
The European Parliament report draws attention to the increasing occurrence of infertility in couples: we know that there are some purely medical phenomena or causes of this problem, but it is also clearly connected to social conditions, in particular to couples postponing starting a family.
I just want to reiterate that we must approach this issue in a coherent and comprehensive manner, not just from a medical standpoint.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is a long list of people waiting to join in the debate, so I will conclude my contribution and look forward to the discussion that will follow.
(Rapporteur on the Commission's Opinion for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs) - (BG) Dear Mr. Commissioner, Dear Mr. Chairman, The overall demographic picture in Europe is very alarming.
According to the Eurostat forecasts, the population in the 15 to 64 age bracket will be reduced by one million persons per year after 2010.
This trend is due to two factors.
Life expectancy continues to grow in all EU Member States, which is a very positive development resulting from the good quality of life in the Community.
However, it is an alarming fact that, at the same time, birth rates are very low, which leads to growing share of the ageing population.
It is this situation that brings about reduction of the share of people in the active age bracket and drop in labour productivity.
The demographic problem threatens the stability of the European economy, the European social model, as well as the solidarity between generations.
In this context, I commend the European Commission's initiative to develop a common European demographic strategy as the only adequate way to meet this global challenge.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament lays the emphasis on the economic tools that give opportunities to improve the demographic situation in the European Union.
The proposed texts point to several major lines of action, including: development of sustainable and balanced public finance; promotion of diverse financial instruments with guaranteed transparency and security; use of tax concessions for companies hiring aged employees; acceleration of the labouyr market liberalization process, or internal migration, to quote Commissioner Spidla in the enlarged EU even before 2014; encouragement of employment among young people and those with family responsibilities through innovative work schemes such as shift work, part-time work, and lifelong learning.
The emphasis is laid on the need for the Member States to fulfill their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact as a way to overcome demographic challenges.
The text includes also some more flexible mechanisms for voluntary retention of people above the minimumk retirement age according to the "salary and pensionâ formula.
The main idea is that if we wish to live up to the demographic challenges, we have to support the establishment of mechanisms enabling flexible employment forms and to encourage the voluntary continuation of active life even after the minimum retirement age.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of demographic change are very varied.
While the outskirts of Paris are shaken time and time again by social unrest owing to the high rate of migration, in Brandenburg, where I come from, the regions are dwindling, people are moving away and the population is aging much more rapidly.
The ageing society places a burden on public budgets, with social benefits to be paid, and the Lisbon Strategy has undertaken to reduce these.
However, in light of the real causes of demographic change, I wonder whether this reduction might not be counterproductive for the Lisbon Strategy.
The Commission is making it fairly easy to blame women for the ageing of society, because they are not having enough children, but the real reasons are current and past political errors.
I would like to address just three of the points that have brought this imbalance in society into being.
The first point is that analyses show that people do in fact want to have children, but parents - not just women - do not have children because the framework conditions are not right, because they do not have any social security, because - as has already been said - it is more difficult for parents to find employment and because career and family cannot be combined.
The solution to this would be a totally new paradigm in relation to work-life balance.
The key would be to divide time for family and career equally between the sexes; the Dublin Foundation has carried out some excellent research on this.
It is also vital that children are not seen as little tickets to poverty, as is the case in many Member States.
For policies of the Member States, what this means is sustainability in the social security system and, although this is an unpopular cost factor, it would put demographic change back on an even keel.
An interesting study carried out in the region that I come from illustrates the second aspect.
In this study, it was established that young women were moving out of the area not because of the problems of combining work and family, but because of massive discrimination that started as soon as they left school.
They are top people, the best in the class, the top graduates, yet they are still offered places on the lower-quality training courses and poorer opportunities to advance their careers.
This means, then, that the European Commission can really be effective in the area where it really has competence, that is, in matters of gender mainstreaming - equal opportunities for men and women - to combat discrimination by introducing improvements to legislation and particularly by exerting pressure on Member States to implement legislation so that things finally get moving.
Thirdly, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to come back to the topic of the declining regions.
In our opinion, we are critical of the way in which the state administrations are still erecting huge barriers to effective involvement by citizens and to the development of innovation and creativity.
By doing this, they are hindering plans for successful regional development.
At the same time, there is a tendency for political leaders to simply write off regions, to withdraw from them claiming that the state has a responsibility to provide basic needs, to simply give up on them.
This is no solution for Europe because over the long term, over generations - as history shows - it will become incredibly expensive.
In reality, it is the task of the state administrations to pick up on the impetus provided by civil society and cooperate with it to pull the regions out of this dilemma.
In this connection, I call on the European Commission to pick up on input from civil society especially, to promote civil society by coordinating the exchange of experience between regions where things are going well and highlighting good examples of tried and tested practice.
These are concrete solutions in which the European Commission can be active without always holding women responsible for demographic change.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
For decades, we have been learning that climate change and pollution of the environment threaten our future.
The Hampton Court summit drew our attention to another process that is becoming risky: Europe is growing old.
Based on the responsibility it feels in this area, the LIBE Committee made three recommendations to the rapporteur and the EMPLOI Committee on matters relating to civil rights.
I would like to thank them for studying our recommendations and taking them into account.
The first area is support for families and children.
Legislating on family support systems falls under national jurisdiction, and yet the assumption of obligations in respect of families with children is also a moral question, and an important part of European values.
Equal opportunities for families with and without children are an extremely important Community interest.
The basis for ensuring the rights of children, however, is that future generations should also feel responsible for the world outside the family.
After analysing the legal and illegal forms of migration, LIBE has drawn attention to the fact that the requirements of an ageing society and of the labour market require a consistent, complex migration policy.
We are delighted that the report goes into this in detail.
In the year of cultural diversity, I might add that, according to experts and science, there may be a direct relationship between migration and the rate of population growth, since the large number of children in second-generation immigrant families is falling, while the presence of immigrants may change the desire of the host population to have children.
Ultimately, discrimination against the elderly and older workers may prevent people who are not young from staying in the labour market.
I would like to emphasise that they cannot be forced to work longer, they must have a real opportunity to choose, and lifelong learning is necessary for this.
Familiarisation with modern communications technology improves their chances of finding work and opens windows to the global world of elderly people.
In its opinion, LIBE asked the Commission repeatedly to make a recommendation on a general anti-discrimination directive, and we hope that this report will speed up the process.
Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, indeed, why are we women having fewer children?
The multitude of reasons and proposed political solutions are contained in the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
My fellow Member Mrs Castex has already successfully incorporated almost all of it in her report. Thank you, Mrs Castex.
How, then, can we help women to fulfil their desire to have children?
Firstly, equal pay for equal work!
That is the only way both parents will have an equal say when they decide who takes parental leave after the birth of a child.
Secondly, both parents are equally responsible for bringing up their children.
