Where citizens see public services and workers' rights undermined, there is no good way of communicating that, so we need to be receptive.
Finally, on the issue of Turkey, I support accession, but the issue of Cyprus must be sorted out.
This is a matter of a continuing illegal occupation.
(PL) Mr President, while we continue to talk of enlargement instead of finding a new solution, the world is changing.
I agree that enlargement is one of the Union's more important policies and that it guarantees peace and security in the region.
It is also true that the previous enlargements have been successful.
But one day, this success could turn to failure.
In the world of physics, only the universe can expand infinitely.
Other systems all burst at some point if they continue to expand.
Instead of talking about enlargement in a rigid, outmoded and redundant manner, we should develop tools for action which we should offer our neighbours, tools such as cooperation, neighbourhood policies and association agreements.
Moreover, a further, cultural criterion should be added to the list of criteria drawn up in 1993 in Copenhagen that candidate countries have to fulfil.
Let our citizens themselves decide by referendum whether they want Turkey to become a Member State of the European Union or to simply be an associate country.
If we want to expand further, then the purpose must surely be to extend European Union membership to countries that are, and have always been, European, such as Serbia, Ukraine or Belarus.
Mr President, the European Union has a seemingly limitless need to absorb more countries.
More and more power is taken away from democratic nation states and concentrated in a centralised and undemocratic European Union.
As Mr Stubb puts it, he wants to see a single entity with a unified structure and a legal personality, in other words, a 'United States of Europe'.
Mr Stubb will not be surprised to know that the UK Independence Party does not agree with that, but I have found something in his report that we can agree with.
When speaking of a revised Constitution, he calls for the adoption of a clause enabling Member States to withdraw from the European Union.
Eventually, Britain will leave the European Union, Constitution or not, withdrawal clause or not, but at least Mr Stubb has the decency to recognise that countries should have the right to secede from the new European empire.
Mr President, sometimes it is worth asking simple, even simplistic, questions: why enlarge the European Union at all?
The simple answer is: in order to enlarge the zone of democracy and stability that Europe has created.
However, the matter is more complex than appears at first sight.
Democracy is not static, but demands constant improvement with the aim of empowering the people.
This is what the deepening of integration is fundamentally about.
It is in this context that enlargement raises a particular problem, and one that has to be tackled.
The European Union insists that future Member States arrive with fully functioning democratic systems - as is proper - yet this overlooks the changes that enlargement brings in its wake within the EU itself.
The problem is this: the entry of new Member States involves not just the states but the new citizens who are added through accession.
Therefore, the enlargement of the European Union simultaneously means the enlargement of the European demos, the citizens of Europe.
Their voice is seldom heard in the enlargement debate, yet leaving out the citizens threatens to exacerbate the democratic deficit.
An EU beset by a democratic deficit cannot be fully effective in extending the zone of democracy to future Member States.
On the contrary, it could even result in exporting the democratic deficit.
That would be completely counterproductive.
Enlargement must take the wishes of the citizens of Europe into account when it comes to their own enlargement, and not take their voice for granted.
Failure to do so would undermine the goal of extending Europe's zone of democracy and stability.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to point out to the gentleman from UKIP that the constitutional treaty does give every country the right to secede from the EU, but no country has as yet done so, and nor will any - not even the United Kingdom - in view of the fact that there are far more advantages to staying in the European Union than to leaving it.
This is not something I would worry about.
There is nothing new about this sort of propaganda on the part of Members who make a speech and then walk out.
It is not worth talking about.
We all agree on the need for a deeper EU, something that we have been promised ever since Maastricht, when there were twelve Member States as against the present twenty-seven, so it is now past high time that we got it.
The same will apply after all future enlargements.
One amendment gives the impression that Croatia and South-Eastern Europe could even now be exempted this requirement, but, on the contrary, the EU must be made deeper before any new countries join it.
It must also be made plain that the blame for these problems lies with the EU itself rather than with the candidates - a point that has been made already.
Our task is to tell people about the objects and benefits of enlargement, not least for our own countries, and explain to them what these are.
All the old Member States benefit to an enormous degree from the arrival of the new ones; since the old export to the new far more than they import from them, this is a 'win-win' strategy, although that is not - alas - communicated to the public.
That is where we have some catching up to do.
There is another problem I want to mention, and it has to do with the procedure for ratifying new accessions.
If individual countries start announcing referendums on the accession of a new Member State, that is going to make matters difficult for us.
That is another issue we will have to address.
Overall, though, my congratulations to the twins on finding the right way ahead, which this House should adopt.
(HU) In today's debate almost everyone concurred that enlargement is a success story.
If this is so, then we have to continue steadfastly with the obligations we have accepted, because Europe has a crucial need for success stories.
The reform of the decision-making procedure and the debate over integration capacity must not slow down the process of enlargement, and must not be a pretext for putting the brakes on enlargement.
Croatia must be judged on its own merits.
The negotiations with Turkey must go on, but Turkey also has to show good faith and must fulfil the conditions.
For Macedonia, we have to clearly define the conditions for starting negotiations.
For potential candidate countries, there must be precise conditions for accession even in the medium term, provided they are ready to fulfil those conditions.
The European Union also has to guarantee more resources, more money and clearer, more easily attainable conditions for the pre-accession funds; otherwise our intention to continue enlargement will not be credible.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, its own enlargement is one of the most effective foreign policy instruments and means of conflict prevention in the European Union's history, but there are both challenges and opportunities in store for us.
After the accessions of Romania and Bulgaria, we can expect to have to deal with that of Croatia, and then, in a later round, not only that of Turkey, but also that of the countries of the Western Balkans, who must not be forgotten in all this.
Difficult a task though it is, the EU must, as it is enlarged, also become deeper, and that will call for reform of the institutional framework.
The problem we have is not so much with the public or with the candidate countries as with the European elites, and that is why I urge Mr Brok to take as his model that great European Helmut Kohl, who had the courage to bring home to the public the importance of a broader and deeper EU.
The time has come for a new initiative to resolve the Cyprus conflict and to bring to an end the isolation of the island's Turkish North.
I rejoice at the undertaking given by the Greek part of the island, but what is also needed is a new initiative under United Nations leadership, which will make possible a final settlement of the conflict and enable the EU to treat the negotiations with Turkey as a matter completely separate from it.
(DE) Mr President, although we cannot predict which countries we will be able to welcome into the European Union, or when, the main thing is that three facts stand out.
The first is that, after Bulgaria and Romania, there will be other accessions to the European Union; the second is that all European states that share our values and meet the Copenhagen criteria are entitled to apply to become Member States of the European Union, and the third is that the Treaty of Nice is not suitable as a basis for future enlargements.
It follows from that that extensive and in-depth reform of the 27-member EU is long overdue.
That would have been an accurate appraisal even six years ago, at the time of the adoption of the Laeken Declaration; it is now more relevant than ever.
I believe that the deepening of the EU before any more enlargements take place is an indispensable requirement, and that the constitutional treaty is the key to the European Union's future viability.
It is not acceptable that unilateral demands be made of the candidates for accession and that they alone be expected to work on themselves, and I therefore hope that it will prove possible, during next year, to find a way out of the constitutional crisis that represents a solution acceptable to all twenty-seven Member States, but the fact is that the complex political melÃ©e will make this extremely difficult.
What will be crucial in terms of integration capacity will be that it should not involve aiming at a merely minimalist - perhaps merely institutional - reform of the European Union.
There must be no retreat from the constitutional treaty in 2009.
It is also absolutely vital that we should succeed in narrowing the gulf between the EU and its citizens; the message must go out loud and clear - and not only to the people of France and the Netherlands - that we are willing to learn from the 'no' votes in those countries, and that that means that we are willing to look at other ways of doing European politics in the future.
That, in my view, means above all that the creation of a social Europe must be put at the heart of European politics - and must stay there.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate needs to send the Commission a clear pointer that it must make its vast enlargement programme contingent on the need for an overall strategy regarding the European Union's political role now and in the future.
That also - perhaps essentially - involves making a geopolitical decision about what the EU's borders ought to be.
That is particularly true and imperative in relation to the highly sensitive issue of Turkey, for which privileged partnership is finally starting to look like a solution.
I agree with these reports on one point, which is that the Commission communication on the enlargement strategy has not given sufficient thought to an essential aspect: the danger that, if future EU enlargement does not involve adequate political, economic, financial and also cultural integration, then it will inevitably result in the weakening, if not the failure, of the European Union as a political project.
It is a fact that the Commission is advancing this enlargement programme with disturbing levity, without even pointing out what financial impact it might have, whereas it is absolutely essential to be fully conscious of that prior to any accession.
We are well aware of the hard work in store for us after Bulgaria and Romania join, so perhaps the time has come to make it clear to the countries waiting to join that, for now, different prospects are opening up for them, as we have pointed out in the case of Turkey.
Let us not forget that it was extremely difficult to reach a compromise on the current financial perspective, which needs to be reviewed soon, by the way.
These arguments make us realise that the position of those governments - like the Prodi Government - that insist at every turn on extending enlargement to the Balkan countries without taking these real difficulties into account at all is the result of irresponsible levity.
Furthermore, the excessive leniency shown in previous accession procedures towards serious matters such as corruption and crime can no longer be tolerated if we want the integration of Europe to continue to conform to the standards and values in which our fellow citizens and our peoples believe.
(FR) Mr President, we, for our part, will also vote against this report, because it has sought to distance itself from the wise Europe of the early days, that is to say, a Europe of the Six, six Member States cooperating with each other in order to strike an Atlantic-wide balance.
Those who believe in supranationality have blown their project out of all proportion by enlarging here, there and everywhere, without even knowing where their borders are.
The fact is that, by demolishing internal borders and by no longer even knowing what a border is, these Euro-maniacs no longer know where to stop.
Consequently, their project is not truly political because, I repeat, there can be no politics without the concept of borders.
Today, these Euro-maniacs are discovering that there is still someone behind the wall, that they still need to enlarge further, because they cannot say 'No' to anyone.
Here they are deprived of any constitution - let them not be under any illusions! - permanently deprived of any constitution.
They are faced with a huge void, forced as they are either to give ground, that is to say to invent a two- or three-speed pragmatic Europe, which would be the most sensible option, or to launch themselves into a breathtaking headlong flight.
Here they are involved with Turkey, here they are faced with new candidate countries in the Caucasus, for example: after all, Georgia is well and truly part of the Council of Europe ...Why not the countries of the Maghreb, or Lebanon, the history of which is so closely associated with that of our nations?
Well, let us get down to it!
Since this poor Europe no longer has any structure, let us keep on enlarging it and, in doing so, let us be careful not to forget States that have been strangely sidelined - Serbia, Russia - perhaps because these countries reluctantly accept the US hegemony?
That says everything there is to say, Mr President, about the failure - yes, the failure - of the so-called European Union.
(DE) Mr President, again and again, and over a period of years, this House, at first cautiously, then - as today - very clearly, has sent out the twofold message that there can be no new enlargement without a working constitution.
By enlarging without ifs or buts and with ever-greater haste, we are doing nobody any good; on the contrary, by dividing Member States into two classes by means of derogations, and alienating Europe's peoples, we imperil that which has already been achieved.
Although enlargement is one of the EU's real successes, many people are more and more inclined to see it as a threat, and to counter that we must be opinion formers in the best sense of the word.
That is not exactly easy, for a constitution possesses little political sex appeal, nor, to a large degree, can it have any, for it essentially has to do with getting institutions to work better and with getting decisions taken by a majority in public view rather than by means of high diplomacy behind closed doors.
It has to do with a financial model that rationally balances functions against the money available for them, and, in many respects, too, with new functions for Europe, even though, even today, very many people already feel that Europe makes itself too much of a nuisance.
Even in warm weather, the energy issue has a European dimension to it, and it is an issue we must address together.
Let me conclude by saying something about Croatia, a candidate country of particular importance to the country from which I come.
Our demand for the Constitution does not mean that we want to stand in the way of Croatia's accession; the contrary is the case.
It is perfectly conceivable that it will join us in 2009 or 2010, provided that the German Presidency manages to breathe new life into the procedure for ratifying the Constitution and reviving the Constitution as an issue.
We wish the incoming German Presidency every success in doing that.
Mr President, Mr Stubb said that enlargement has been the most successful EU policy, spreading stability, peace and prosperity across our continent.
That logic still applies.
Of course it means that the European Union must adapt, especially in terms of institutional reform.
However, does it mean that we should block any enlargement until all institutional reforms have been achieved?
If that were the case, the last enlargement would never have happened, because the Treaty of Nice was clearly insufficient.
Perhaps even the 1973 enlargement might not have happened.
The fact is that enlargement is one of the factors that drive reform.
Some Member States that are reluctant to embrace institutional reform often accept its necessity as a consequence of enlargement.
Therefore supporters of reform should be supporters of enlargement.
Yet Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo said that there should be no future enlargements without the Constitutional Treaty.
Indeed, paragraph 9 of Mr Stubb's report states that 'any enlargement requires...' - and then there is a long list of items that are all contained in the Constitutional Treaty.
We have a slight difficulty with that absolute position.
Mr Brok said that those who push hardest for widening are often those who oppose deepening.
Yet if you want to force both, you need to press for both.
There is a real danger that, on the one hand, you will have people who say that they do not want enlargement until we have institutional reform and, on the other, you will have those who say that we do not need institutional reform until we have enlargement.
If you want to drive forward both agendas you need to support both, because it is both that will drive us forward to having an enlarged and a reformed European Union.
That is why our group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 9 to make it clear that we do not see as a precondition having every single part of an institutional agenda accepted before any single enlargement takes place.
We believe that the two processes - enlargement and reform - will go together; they will drive each other forward and they may, perhaps, end up being enacted on the same day - a new treaty and an accession treaty perhaps rolled into one.
(ES) Mr President, enlargement must not be a goal in itself.
It is a way of expanding a project and we cannot allow that project to be weakened as a result of enlargement.
At the end of the day, this debate is really undermining our ability to talk about what Europe wants to be, what it wants to do.
Paragraph 8 of the Brok report is very clear.
Sadly, we may be, and in fact we are, rushing ahead in a manner that is preventing us from talking about our own problems and difficulties on the pretext of enlargement.
There are institutional reforms that cannot wait, enlargement or no enlargement.
There are political and financial measures that can be implemented now without any reform.
There are serious legitimacy problems and shameful actions on the part of the European Commission, such as secretly approving rules in the field of airport safety to be imposed on airports, without any kind of democratic control and without informing the citizens.
There are many actions that damage the democratic legitimacy of our institutions.
All of that needs to be resolved.
We must clearly open up the debate on enlargement, and the two fronts must be opened up in parallel.
But enlargement must not be used as a pretext for failing to tackle the serious problems facing the European Union today, with or without Turkey, with or without enlargement.
(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Brok and Mr Stubb for their reports and highlight the problems around the possible accession of Croatia, a country that has made considerable progress in recent years and can therefore meet the political and economic challenge of the Copenhagen criteria.
Since its integration capacity would not thereby be put to the test, the EU should devise a clear and purposeful strategy for Croatia's speedy integration.
We cannot make the country a hostage to the EU's internal problems, and should take a flexible line on its accession.
If it happens, it will mean relatively little for the EU, but a great deal for Croatia in terms of its democratic future.
(EL) Mr President, I wish to comment on one of the two reports we are debating today, the Stubb report.
It is a report that promotes efforts to increase the operability of the Union at the level of decision-taking procedures and to institutionalise it such that decisions are basically taken by its leading nucleus without any right of veto for the smaller and once more independent states.
The rapporteur has obviously not listened to public opinion, which has twice rejected the Constitutional Treaty.
There is no other way to explain the fact that it digs up a dead text and adopts its anti-democratic provisions.
The content of the changes deepens the lack of democracy rather than reducing it or abolishing it.
They aim to promote the Constitutional Treaty with its anti-grassroots content by 2009.
Instead of extending the rights of citizens and information for them, they clearly understand the operability and the decision-taking procedure of the European Union as an almost exclusive right of the strong circles of the European Union.
How very sad that once again the citizen has been left out.
(PL) Mr President, when debating the European Union's enlargement strategy, we should consider our vision a common Europe.
Hitherto, ruthless political attempts to force the constitution through have reflected a desire to create a supranational political organisation where the largest European countries have the deciding majority.
The issue of European Union enlargement is generally discussed in this light.
Economic issues are sidelined.
The European Union wants to welcome as many countries as can be dominated by the largest European countries.
That is why, from the point of demographic potential, the prospect of Turkey or Ukraine joining the European Union next couple of years is not acceptable to the decision-makers.
I would like to stress that the European Union can only survive if economic issues prevails over political considerations and over the ambition of creating a new, twenty-first century Roman Empire ruled by just three or four countries.
. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Elmar Brok and Mr Alexander Stubb, colleagues from my political group, for the effort they have put into their reports.
Both texts display a thorough and competent approach to one of the most important challenges facing the European Union, namely its further enlargement.
As a citizen of a country which joined the European Community two and a half years ago, I can appreciate the benefits of membership, both for the Polish economy and for the lives of millions of Poles.
I am also convinced that the most recent enlargement benefited not only the new members.
The whole Union benefited, both in economic terms and in terms of security and stability.
The same was the case for the earlier enlargements of the European Community.
Both the new members and the existing Member States benefited.
The European Union is an example of a successful venture because it has never confined itself to an elite circle of founding members, but has been able to grow wisely, thereby becoming an increasingly influential player on an increasingly global stage.
I have no doubt that further enlargements are in store for the European Union.
The Balkan states and the Union's eastern neighbours will one day be part of the European Union and this too will benefit our Community.
I do not doubt the need for institutional reforms before the next enlargement.
However, I would like to express my fear that making this process totally dependant on adopting all the points of the Constitutional Treaty when it has been rejected in the French and Dutch referenda may create the undesirable impression that the Union does not want any new members.
This would send a very negative message to societies in countries which wish to join our Community.
We should not and I believe we do not want to restrict ourselves to the current circle of members, which already consists of twenty-seven countries.
Our willingness to accept new members should not be a pawn in our internal disputes regarding the shape of the European institutions.
(FR) Mr President, European neighbourhood policy and the presence of Hungarian minorities make Hungary the country most affected by the future enlargement of the Union: Croatia, Serbia, other countries in the Western Balkans.
Be that as it may, the main task right now is to strengthen and implement in-depth economic and institutional reforms, without, however, shutting the door on enlargement.
It is regrettable that, from the perspective of the history of the European Community, this enlargement should not have been preceded by economic and institutional development: Europe cannot be enlarged with relatively fewer resources and without a Constitutional Treaty!
The 2004 enlargement had a positive, beneficial outcome for the old and new Member States.
This is a win-win situation.
The ten new Member States were integrated without any problems, without any economic disruption, without any social dumping and without any migratory flows.
After the enlargement, the European Union was able to adopt the Services Directive, REACH and the financial perspective, and it is going to extend the Schengen system.
What is required, however, ladies and gentlemen, is a European campaign, because the countries of the West do not know the real cost of enlargement, and the new Member States have become scapegoats for problems within those countries.
Mr President, European values and the principles of justice, democracy, freedom of speech and respect for human rights: fine words, mostly spoken in excess at inconsequential ceremonies and meaningless functions of hypocrisy, but seldom seriously meant or implemented.
The decadence of the European spirit, coupled with the championship of subordination to the US Administration, reigns supreme in a European Union that is threatened with disintegration from within by the short-sightedness of Enlargement Commissioners, and through backstabbing by Britannic leaders forever poodling to the wishes of their transatlantic masters.
This is the sorry state of affairs of a Commission and Council that are gradually sinking the EU into disillusion by allowing a military-controlled Asiatic state, instead of fulfilling its obligations, to dictate its terms for granting us the honour of joining the EU.
Dear Colleagues, make no mistake.
With this kind of Turkish accession, it is not the EU that will be enlarging, but Turkey.
So, Mr Rehn, congratulations on your determined efforts to accomplish the successful accession of the EU to a revived Grand Turkish Ottoman Empire, and good luck to our citizens who are watching in dismay and helplessness!
(EL) Mr President, congratulations to Mr Brok and to Mr Stubb on their exceptional work.
I have the following comments to make:
Continuing enlargement policy: it is important and must be extended in a coordinated manner to the remaining countries of the Western Balkans, especially in view of imminent developments on the Kosovo question.
European prospects and enlargement policy are policies for peace and cooperation which we are all striving for.
Turkey: a decision was taken the other day which moves in the right direction.
However, Commissioner, I call on you to re-examine the idea of the timetable, because this would complement and improve the decision taken and would also help you to protect the credibility of the European Union.
Neighbourhood policy: the Commission communication is inadequate.
However, it is an important policy, which must be developed.
Consequently, we await a new communication, an improved and more integrated communication.
Finally, an enlarged Europe will be more democratic, more efficient, more transparent and with more social sensibilities if it finally acquires its Constitution.
The procedures are restarting, the right approach is a step by step approach to the issues and problems which constitute it, but this step by step approach also has a sell-by date.
(SV) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Brok and Mr Stubb for this debate on the enlargement process and for their reports.
I would like to start by commenting on the views expressed by Mr Brok in recital F to the effect that enlargement should not undermine the political nature of this project.
I come from Sweden, a country that has clearly stated in every study that a continued enlargement process is one of the most important issues facing the EU.
My worry today is that we are not speaking clearly about continued enlargement and about the future membership of Turkey.
Many Members of this House are opposed to Turkey's membership, a fact that has already been made clear by the request from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the vote on Turkey's membership negotiations to be by secret ballot.
Many of us, myself included, found it incomprehensible that politicians are afraid to stand up for their opinions before their voters, the citizens of Europe.
In the past year views have been put forward on numerous occasions that have made me wonder whether there is any will for continued enlargement, even if we solve the central issues that are at the top of our agenda.
We need a new Constitution, irrespective of whether more Member States join the Union, to ensure, amongst other things, a modern decision-making process.
We need to reform agricultural policy to ensure the new jobs of the future and a sustainable Europe.
We need a bigger budget for future funding.
I wonder what Mr Brok means when he says, in paragraph 11, that the Union can only function if all of its members share common values arising from a European identity.
Am I to interpret that as closing the door on Turkey?
My group, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, has tabled an amendment, number 29, which we call on everyone to support.
We are in complete agreement that Turkey must meet the requirements we set out from the very beginning in respect of Cyprus, the Kurds and human rights, as well as the requirements that apply to everyone else.
Let us speak clearly, however, and keep these different agendas apart.
(FI) Mr President, first I want to thank the duo of Mr Brok and Mr Stubb for their reports.
As we know, they are both highly competent and gifted, but the direction in which they want to take the European Union is not necessarily the one that I am in favour of.
It is true that reforms are needed, and it is true that enlargement has in many respects proven an excellent and effective way to take the European Union forward.
On some points, however, we also need to remember the limitations of enlargement.
The European Union policy cannot be one where we just expand and expand the whole time, and when there are problems we create new agencies.
We also need to be able to discuss in greater depth what the European Union will be like in the future, what sort of Union we need, and what its work really consists of.
In this respect I hope that the limitations will also be taken into account in this debate on enlargement.
We often ask questions about limits to growth in our keynote addresses, but now that we are talking about the enlargement of the European Union we forget that there are certain limits to this aspect of growth too.
(PL) Mr President, the plan of enlarging the European Union further is today losing public favour.
The most recent enlargement was logical, as it represented the definitive overcoming of the artificial division of Europe that was a consequence of the Yalta Conference.
The question now being asked is what is the point of further enlargements.
This question brings into question the purpose of the great project that is the European Union.
What is a common Europe and what should it be?
Is it only a political community which is meant to ensure the stability of democratic government for its members, respect for human rights and civil freedoms, acceptance of the rule of law and, ultimately, prosperity, thanks to an efficient market economy?
Or is it a community of values, reaching back to common roots and a common cultural heritage?
In that case, what are those roots and what is the heritage?
Cultural historians highlight the fact that the contemporary European identity is the product of many historical traditions.
In each of us, as in each of the European nations, something remains of the Greek philosophical tradition and of Roman republicanism.
We are the heirs to the humanism of the Renaissance and rationalism of the Enlightenment and, regardless of whether we admit it or not, we also have a Christian heritage.
Let us not deceive ourselves.
Even if some of us today do not want to accept this tradition, it is still part of contemporary European identity.
If nothing else, it is present in the fundamental principle of human dignity, which is the basis for a whole package of basic laws.
As Mr Elmar Brok's report states that the 'Union can only function properly if all of its members share common values arising from a European identity', he must have in mind an identity that includes our Christian heritage.
We must not forget to refer to this heritage when we draw up a constitution.
(PL) Mr President, today, the day on which I utter these words, is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the imposition of martial law in Poland, of the attempt to destroy the Solidarity trade union and the movement of Polish society towards freedom and democracy.
Twenty-five years later I am speaking in an entirely different world, in the European Parliament, in a Europe based on the principles of democracy, peace, the rule of law and justice.
This personal reference to history clearly proves the good that the European Union represents for all Europeans.
Today, we are facing the challenge of balancing further enlargement with the European Union's absorption capacity.
On the one hand, the European Union cannot turn its back on countries aiming to achieve membership, to shut itself away in an ivory tower of wealth and Western civilisation.
On the other hand, it cannot allow the social and legal foundations of the Community to be diluted or to disappear completely.
The European Union should fulfil its obligations towards countries aspiring to membership, and pay particular attention to how these countries perform in implementing the rule of law, an independent judiciary and respect for fundamental rights.
The institutions of the European Union have to provide a more precise definition of a stronger Neighbourhood Policy.
To this end we need to establish a European Union-Black Sea community.
Relations between the European Union and Russia remain a fundamental issue and cover both trade and energy, as well as, first and foremost, issues of human rights, the rule of law and democracy.
(SV) Mr President, the period of reflection has clearly shown that the great challenge now is to convince the people of Europe that they can take part in decision-making and influence the future of the EU.
It is important that they dare to trust in their abilities to influence and that they also want to give their support when, in future, the EU wants to accept new Member States, and potentially many of them.
Every European must be able to feel that he or she is represented in the European Parliament.
This goes without saying for many, but not for everyone.
As a result of the national electoral systems and the regulations on the distribution of seats in the European Parliament, a large group of Europeans will be excluded from Parliament when the enlargement process continues.
I am referring to the regional and national linguistic minorities that today constitute around 50 million people. That is fully 10% of the population of the EU.
Even in the last election we lost four minorities.
It is deplorable if large groups are to be systematically excluded from decision-making within the EU.
If that happens we should not expect automatic support from these people for the European structure in future.
This issue must be taken seriously when the EU's Basic Treaty is reviewed.
The EU must not create second-class citizens.
(NL) Mr President, I too should like to extend a huge compliment to the two rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Stubb, for their excellent work.
Enlargement, as many have said before me, is one of Europe's biggest success stories.
If people think that is obvious, all we need to do is to remind ourselves of Mr Milinkevich, yesterday's speaker in this Chamber, who has been in jail many times himself.
His son was in prison last time he was here, as are hundreds of people, simply for fighting for freedom.
Things could have been very different for Eastern Europe, and the democratic reforms of all those countries that have joined in such a short space of time are a remarkable feat in which Europe should take a great deal of pride.
In order, however, to retain support for this effective enlargement, the right balance must be struck in a few areas.
One could compare this with a house.
If one continues to add bedrooms on the first and second floors, one will need to reinforce the foundations, and that is why it is very important that Parliament should now speak out so emphatically in favour of introducing a new treaty before the next enlargement round.
This is not so much intended for the new countries as it is for us.
Rather than being complacent, we should do now what needs to be done.
Much has been said about integration capacity.
It is indeed to be welcomed that the concept has been introduced, although it now needs to be deepened at institutional, financial and treaty level.
Since, however, integration capacity also involves public support, we need to explain to them that enlargement is a good thing, we can make certain demands of the candidate Member States, and we must, by carrying out convincing reforms, try to retain the European public's support for this process.
Finally, with regard to Turkey, a clear penalty was needed, because conditions are there to be met.
At the same time, a clear and additional signal has been sent by the Council, moments of assessment have been built in, rules for Turkey have been stepped up to some degree; at the same time, there is also pressure on us to put arrangements in place for the sake of the Northern Cypriots.
I should like to repeat emphatically that we are behind the reformers in Turkey.
We hope that next year, progress will be made as regards Cyprus and we hope, above all, that we will now once again be able to turn our attention to the necessary reforms in Turkey.
I urge the reformers to make headway now in the areas of the free expression of opinion and freedom of religion, so that next year this rapporteur can be more positive compared to last year.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to make four points:
Firstly, there is a myth - because it is a myth - that enlargement and deepening are conflicting states.
In fact, since the beginning of the 1980s, it is this enlargement which has imposed further deepening on us: Structural Funds, EMU and greater cooperation in order to combat organised crime, immigration and peace in the world.
That is why it must continue.
The second point naturally concerns the Western Balkans.
I am delighted that the process of their integration is not being questioned, nor should it.
Thirdly, the saga of 'absorption capacity' or 'integration capacity', by which we mean the capacity for new countries to accede.
This is Europe's obligation.
Its obligation.
Just as the Copenhagen criteria are an obligation for the other countries.
We are not like journalists or statisticians monitoring whether this capacity exists or does not exist.
We must create it, precisely in order to allow further enlargement.
The fourth point concerns Turkey.
What a pity about the haggling I have witnessed over recent days.
While the Commission talks about the need for 'strict conditionality', meaning clear preconditions, in the case of Turkey it is sending out a conflicting message.
It does not exert pressure on it directly to apply its obligation concerning the protocol, it does exert pressure on it to recognise one of the 25 Member States, Cyprus; it haggles over whether one or two or three ports will open, completely ignoring the root of the problem, which is a military occupation that infringes all the European values that we maintain should be strengthened for the purpose of enlargement.
I call on the Commission, intensely, to get this effort back to basics with a timetable and demands on Turkey, for the benefit of Turkey itself and the democrats in that country.
(LT) Expansions, both the most recent and the earlier ones, have strengthened the Union, encouraged its economic growth and increased its importance in the world.
Therefore, we must maintain our commitment to further expand the European Union, as this is an historic opportunity and responsibility to create a unified and flourishing Europe.
However, expansion must be carried out together with the deepening of the EU, with the adaptation of its institutions to continue to operate with new members on board.
From this year forward, the EU structures apply to 27 Member States.
In order for Europe to be able to expand and function effectively, we need to perform a few urgent tasks:
1.
We need to strengthen public support for expansion, and for this we need to comprehensively explain the advantages of European expansion, its gains, economic benefits and historic responsibilities;
2.
We have to revise the financial plan, including the financial system, to adapt it to the new requirements of an expanded Union;
3.
We need to undertake the necessary institutional improvements and changes.
Therefore, it is most important that the countries, which will share the EU presidency until 2008, take the initiative to make the Constitutional consensus a reality.
Finally, I would like to note that looking to the future it is essential to revitalise Europe's neighbourhood policy, which would allow countries participating in it not only to develop reforms quicker and expand links with the European Union, but, if they wish, to ultimately aspire to become members.
(HU) Speaking also on behalf of my colleague PÃ¡l Schmitt, chairman of the delegation to the EU-Croatia joint parliamentary committee, I congratulate Mr Brock and Mr Stubb for their excellent and realistic report.
We Hungarians are glad that the reports strengthen the Copenhagen principle according to which each state wishing to join must proceed towards negotiations on its own merits.
Accordingly, in the case of Croatia, presently engaged in negotiations, we can declare with confidence that we will welcome them as new members in this wave, on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria.
In fact, Croatia's entry is essentially the completion of the fifth wave of EU enlargement, that of the Central European region.
Croatia is linked to this wave mainly through Slovenia, Austria and Hungary, by its level of development, by its legal and institutional culture and by its thousand-year-old heritage.
On another level, Croatia may serve as a good example for states wishing to begin the enlargement of the European Union in the Western Balkans.
Fortunately Croatia's admission, given its size and development, does not present problems with regard to either the internal market or the budget.
As for the institutional conditions for accession, these can be fulfilled by amending the Treaty of Nice, a task that, in the absence of a Constitution, will have to be addressed eventually for purposes of accession.
At the same time, the principle of specific merits and further enlargement really need to be examined more seriously, henceforth in the Western Balkans as well as within the Union.
That is the case as regards Croatia's neighbour, Serbia, which entertains great hopes and where the northern province of Voivodina may serve as a bridge precisely on account of its western roots.
It could keep playing this bridging role if Serbia were to strive to preserve the region instead of continuing its present practice of suppressing the traditional culture of indigenous EU peoples.
If the latter continues, then rather than a European Union based on our own cultural values, we will instead be looking at a Byzantine Union.
(FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Stubb for his work on this very sensitive subject.
His report has the virtue of tackling the problem of integration capacity from different angles.
I am therefore delighted that the text is not limited to mentioning the institutional aspects of this issue, but that it also highlights other major reforms, without which the Union could not accommodate new members.
I am thinking, in particular, of the review of the Union's financing system.
I am also grateful to the rapporteur for having succeeded in making sure that this report is neutral towards the candidate countries and in preventing the pitfall that would have consisted in expressing, on that occasion, a position on the entry of a given State.
Finally, this report rightly emphasises the enhanced role that should be granted to Parliament, not only in the context of the accession process, but also in that of future institutional reforms.
I do have one criticism to make, however: it seems to me, in fact, that, in perhaps wanting to do too much of a good job, the rapporteur has somewhat shifted the report away from its initial aim by making it more a report that concentrates on all of the reforms necessary within the European Union than on the more specific issue of integration capacity.
Rather than enumerating a long list of institutional reforms, it would have been better, in my opinion, to have concentrated solely on the reforms that constitute genuine prerequisites for any further enlargement.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, the EU enlargement process has been a great success, with the number of Member States having increased from 6 to 27.
We have been able to see a whole new Europe take shape.
To start to have doubts now and talk of 'fatigue' in respect of continuing enlargement would be to take a step in the wrong direction.
Obviously, the criteria relating to democracy, human rights and a well-functioning state under the rule of law must be met.
We have also seen the earthshaking transformation of the old Eastern and Central Europe.
It is true that the EU needs new forms of decision-making, but the Union must not introduce new conditions for those countries that are currently attempting to become members.
Commissioner, I personally find the forces within the European Union that are attempting to put obstacles in the path of a future Turkish membership quite disquieting.
Our vision of the future must be of a complete Europe - and that includes Turkey.
(DE) Mr President, in contrast to one of the earlier speakers, I regard enlargement as an instrument not of external policy, but rather of European domestic policy; that is why the process of enlarging the EU must not be allowed to burst the bounds of Europe through the accession of a large country like Turkey, which is either only partly European or not European at all.
Were that to happen, the European Union would become a Eurasian structure like the Council of Europe, with the addition of an internal market, something that cannot be an attractive prospect to anyone who seeks a really effective Europe that replaces our nation states in the exercise of essential functions, the sort of Europe that convinced federalists - myself among them - want.
On the other hand, though, we cannot block the entrance to countries that very definitely are European, and so I repudiate those attempts at interpreting the Brok report - certain points in which certainly are amenable to interpretation - in such a way as to make the adoption of the constitutional treaty appear an indispensable requirement for the accession of a central European country such as Croatia.
In their own recent resolutions, the European People's Party, the CDU and the CSU have explicitly stated that Croatia constitutes an exception in terms of the enlargement process by reason of its size, its position in Central Europe and its preparedness, and that it should actually have been taken together with Hungary and Slovenia.
It might well be described as a leftover - de facto rather than de jure - of the enlargement process that we are currently completing, and that is why I will resist all attempts at interpretations that would make Croatia - as Mr HorÃ¡Äek so rightly said - a hostage to the constitutional process.
Yes, of course we have to move the constitutional process forward in this decade; yes, of course we need the constitutional treaty in order to be able to make further strides in the next decade by welcoming into the European Union states - such as those in south-eastern Europe between Croatia and Greece - whose European nature is not in doubt, first among them Macedonia, which already has the status of a candidate state.
It is countries such as these that have an entitlement to full Member State status, and that is an entitlement we will uphold.
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, I would like to say something about communication.
I too object to the idea of enlargement as a foreign policy instrument, but my reasons for doing so differ from Mr Posselt's; I do indeed believe that we have problems, for you can see for yourself how whole brigades of well-meaning global strategists, laden down with foreign policy instruments, scurry through Europe and beyond, proclaiming: 'Worried about the threat of civil war?
Join the EU!' and see in all its clarity the reason why so many citizens of the EU say: 'No thanks, I am not an instrument.
I do not exist to solve foreign policy problems.
That is not why I regard myself as a citizen of the EU; if that is what the European Union is about, I would rather not have anything to do with it.'
The second thing I want to say about communication is that it raises the question of what actual relation there is between the constant claim that we have to discharge the obligations into which we have entered, and our willingness to take a rigorous line with candidate countries both in the course of negotiations and in the run-up to them, in order to get these countries to make commitments and stick to them, when, in this debate - and congratulations to Mr Posselt - every conceivable back door is opened in the hope of getting one party or other's favourite candidate into the EU before the Constitution has been adopted.
The man and woman in the street is very well aware of the message that sends out, so there is no cause to talk about enlargement fatigue in an accusatory tone of voice.
Those who think the only problems have to do with matters of fact would do better to get stuck in to these communications problems.
(SL) I should like to welcome both these reports as a clear expression of the political will of the European Parliament, which strengthens the credibility of the European Union.
I see them as an expression of our responsibility towards the future of the European Union, and also as an expression of our joint responsibility towards global progress.
I will not make any specific comments about the two reports, but I am, in any case, in favour of replicating their philosophy.
It seems to me somewhat paradoxical that while, on the one hand, we are talking about a crisis in the European Union, on the other, we are this Christmas literally faced with the fact that a large number of countries, in Europe and even beyond, are keen to join the European family.
Our response should not be that there are not enough chairs around the European table or that we are having problems drawing up house rules.
I am particularly pleased to note that Mr Brok's report clearly specifies that close multilateral relations do not mean an alternative to fully-fledged membership, but an additional opportunity for countries which are currently a long way off from achieving fully-fledged membership.
In addition, I support the clear stance towards the countries of South-East Europe.
I should like to see them all included by name in the next report, as none of them deserves to be mentioned in a list of the countries left over (I think that this is important for us).
Also, the following principle should be applied to Croatia and to all the countries following in Croatia's footsteps involved in the so-called Thessalonica process: as soon as a candidate country is ready, the European Union should be ready, too.
The European ambition should be rewarded.
(PL) Mr President, I will begin by congratulating both rapporteurs.
Now, moving on to the matter at hand, I would like to draw your attention to the following issue.
The European Union has proved to be a very attractive project and it has, for many years, attracted new countries.
That is why, in my opinion, today's debate on whether the European Union should expand further is academic, as the Maastricht Treaty provides the answer.
Article 49 of the Treaty clearly states that any European country that meets the political and economic criteria may join the European Union.
These criteria were drawn up in Copenhagen in 1993 and we should not tighten them up now.
Today's debate is meant to answer the fundamental question of whether we can change the criteria for further enlargements as current needs and expectations dictate.
I do not think that we can.
I believe that we are bound by the principle of keeping our word, of upholding agreements and the ancient Roman principle of 'pacta servanta sum'.
That is why the so-called absorption capacity cannot suddenly appear as a criterion used to block access to the European Union for countries which have fulfilled the Copenhagen criteria.
All successive enlargements have strengthened the Union, and have favoured its growth.
However, these enlargements had to be well planned.
I think that only a European constitution will make it possible to ensure that further enlargements are well planned.
Mr President, I agree with Mrs LehtomÃ€ki that enlargement has to continue as an open process because, in defiance of many warnings and fears, all previous enlargements have turned out to be a big success for the EU as a whole.
It has been, and will continue to be, a win-win process for all the players involved.
Mr Stubb was right to remind us that every new round of enlargement has forced the EU, in a most positive way, to deepen its internal preparedness through new reforms.
The message today is that the Nice basis is no longer sufficient for a new enlargement round.
There is no alternative to the adoption of the Constitutional Treaty and applying it in practice.
However, the integration capacity is not to be seen as an additional criterion for the new applicants.
It should be seen as an internal commitment to make maximum efforts to achieve the necessary new quality of our cohesion.
The EU should not send the wrong signal that we will close our doors to new applicants.
Every European nation is entitled to join the EU and is entitled to be treated not as a guest, but as a potential and welcome member of this ever-growing family.
Therefore, we need to show maximum openness to the interested nations, including Mr Milinkevich's home country.
Finally, enlargement is not only about the budgets and institutions.
There is a huge undercurrent of popular opinions, fears and prejudices.
This is popular psychology into which the Constitutional Treaty has tumbled.
Therefore, we need openly to address these needs and fears by stimulating frank and friendly debate between old and new Member States on our different and historic cultural experiences.
My experience is that these fears and prejudices are actually very similar, and that most of them prove to be unfounded.
There is a huge reserve of popular support for the Constitutional Treaty.
Mr President, finally there has been no collision of trains!
The Government of Cyprus has agreed with its partners to the so-called 'delay' of Turkey's train.
Let us not fool ourselves.
We are not supposed to open most of the suspended chapters anyhow as it will take some years to gather the benchmarks and closing a chapter is a formality - it means nothing once all the other work has been completed.
As to the reviews, these take place every year anyhow.
Cyprus has often been overplayed as the reason for the collision of the trains.
Now, it is essentially out of the way.
The European Union is free to see reality face to face.
Turkey has ignored and still declares that it will ignore its obligations concerning its Customs Union agreement, an obligation that existed well before the issue of the so-called isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.
The real questions are now in front of us: freedom of expression, freedom of religious minorities, the human rights record in southern Turkey, treatment of women, the issues of corruption, the intervention of the military in government and judiciary affairs.
Only two days ago, General Buyukanit admonished the Erdogan Government for not getting his permission for what finally proved to be a conditional opening of one port to Cypriot ships.
Some say that we should not see Turkey as it is today.
Think of how Turkey will be in 15 years' time!
Turkey has given us some idea as to its will to become a true European democracy.
It knows how to get away with it!
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I absolutely share the concerns of numerous European citizens who wish, before there is any further enlargement, for the institutional problems to be resolved.
It is senseless for us to want to function satisfactorily with 27 members with rules which applied when there were 9, 10 or 15 members in the Union.
Unfortunately, the Constitutional Treaty, which contained numerous positive elements, was not accepted by two nations.
Since then the matter has been on ice.
I am delighted that Chancellor Merckel has expressed her intention to table proposals on the procedure and timetable for resolving the problem.

However, I believe that, at this stage, we must aim to settle a limited number of issues, which are nonetheless important to the smooth functioning of the Union, such as the creation of the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Union, a reduction in the number of Commissioners, an increase in the responsibilities of the European Parliament, a reduction to the minimum in the need for unanimity in the method for passing decisions in the Council, the legal personality of the European Union, the abolition of the system of three pillars and strengthening the institution of reinforced cooperation between the Member States and wherever else it is considered necessary to efficient functioning.
I wonder, though, how many of the Member States, old and new, will overcome their internal pettifogging and set as the sovereign objective the smooth functioning and efficiency of the Europe of the 27 Member States.
In all events, I believe, to close, that if we do not make the Union operational, there is no point in debating further enlargement.
(PL) Mr President, anyone who is fortunate enough to be a citizen of the European Union would be committing a mortal sin by suggesting closing this door of opportunity to others who want it.
The question of limiting enlargement is ridiculous.
It is like putting limits on freedom or to democracy.
Today's discussion has shown that we view the capacity for and effects of enlargement largely from the perspective of the European Union's internal situation.
We talk about the need for far-reaching reforms, and quite rightly, as we cannot afford to be weak if we want to achieve success.
The reforms are necessary, but they need to follow a diagnosis of the situation and a carefully thought-out programme of improvements.
I think it would be a good idea to internally restructure the work of the European Commission.
If today we have twenty-seven Commissioners deciding on the scope of their portfolios, then perhaps it might be sensible to appoint two or three Commissioners who would be responsible for analysing the situation in the European Union and preparing the reform programme in such a way as to ensure that we are capable of further enlargement.
However, we cannot view this capability solely through an internal perspective.
We must remember what the citizens of the countries aspiring to join us think of the European Union and of potential European Union membership.
My own personal experiences of work in delegations with countries of the Southern Caucasus, as well as Moldova and Ukraine, have shown that ordinary people there do not believe that they will get instant membership, but they do want to be sure that the door has not been slammed shut.
They are prepared to wait twenty or even thirty years for the chance to join us.
This is a door of opportunity we cannot close to them.
The EU's information policy should clearly state what the EU is about, what its aims are and what it means to be a member of the European Union.
We must not forget this.
Mr President, the smooth successive waves of EU enlargement are a magnificent achievement of the EU.
The fifth wave, which enlarged the Union to 25 Member States two years ago, has actually been a great success, in spite of warnings that the Union would be paralysed without a constitution and that countries such as my own would suffer unsustainable immigration flows, including from the Roma population.
Regrettably, the Brok report seeks again to link further enlargement to the absolute need for an EU Constitution, whereas British Conservatives, whom I represent, would argue that this is not the case and that what we really need are Treaty adjustments, via an amended Nice Treaty, to reflect the new voting strength in the Council, the number of MEPs and Commissioners, after the expected relatively painless accession of Croatia in the next couple of years.
I am of the personal opinion that we now also need to look seriously at the top-heavy Commission.
However, I believe we should not rotate Commissioners absolutely equally amongst all Member States, but some mathematical formula must be found to preserve, at least in a semi-permanent presence, the Commissioners of the big Member States - but I know this is controversial.
The new Member States have, broadly speaking, been more Atlanticist: they believe in freer markets and competitive rates of low taxation, which is an approach I welcome.
I believe that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria on 1 January 2007 will also prove to be a great success.
As rapporteur, I believe that the European Neighbourhood Policy must be split into a southern EuroMed dimension through the Barcelona Process and a new eastern concept of an enhanced free-trade and visa-facilitated EU-Black Sea community to further strengthen our ties with European countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and the three Caucus republics.
I call on the Member States to inform Moldova and Ukraine that they are in the longer term entitled, in my view, in the same way as all the countries in the Western Balkans are entitled, to become potential candidates for EU membership.
(DE) Mr President, the vision of a Europe united and at peace was born, as we know, in the ruins shortly after the end of the Second World War, and it has been further worked on and developed ever since.
In much the same way as a conglomerate's headlong expansion can put its workforce under intolerable strain, the EU and its own people have parted company, and I do not believe that the acceptance that has been lost will be won back by PR campaigns when what matters more is that existing problems - such as jobs, globalisation, terrorism, crime and refugees - be resolved.
Nor, indeed, do I regard the worries about the EU's integration capacity as anything more than another sedative intended to take people's minds off the delusions about enlargement that we already have.
Up to now, we have insisted only on the applicants fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria, while the question as to whether the EU itself could achieve the goals of cohesion and integration was treated as unimportant.
If we are to be able to cope with the feeling of dealing with something incomprehensible and boundless, we need not only to impose geographical limits, but also to become clear in our own minds just how much in the way of social and cultural differences the EU can handle, and I do believe that the policy of unhindered immigration over recent years means that we are dealing with far more people than we stand any chance of integrating.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank everyone for this diverse, wide-ranging and constructive debate.
Although there seem to be certain areas of disagreement, a fairly strong common attitude is discernible in Parliament.
It is very clear that, for enlargement to succeed, we have to ensure that the Union develops internally and that it remains able to function in all situations.
This is a key element in integration capacity and, as was stated in this debate, the European Union needs to do its homework.
As for the enlargement processes and negotiations under way, we should remember that the homework has not been done with regard to the latest processes either.
On Monday the Council reached political consensus on the objective of enhancing economic development in North Cyprus as quickly as possible and even earlier, especially given the decisions taken in April 2004.
The other aspect of enlargement and the other responsible party is obviously the candidate countries and those interested in membership of the European Union, and they must fulfil the EU membership criteria.
The extent to which they do this needs to be judged very objectively and, if need be, critically too, and we naturally have confidence in the very worthy Commission, its willingness and its ability to carry out this assessment.
This is certainly a good way to proceed, in order that prospects of membership increase on the basis of progress made, and not that dates agreed beforehand define when membership is to be finalised.
Much has been said in this debate about the Constitutional Treaty and its future.
We all share the view that the Constitution contains plenty of elements that are important for improving the Union's integration capacity.
We nevertheless have to bear in mind that the Constitutional Treaty, or reform of the Union, is not needed for the sake of enlargement: it is needed to improve the Union's present situation and ability to function.
It is also important to remember that we cannot entrust the Union's ability to function solely to the Constitutional Treaty.
Treaties are, after all, just a tool to implement European Union policy.
Without the political will and commitment to the common European project, not even the best treaties can yield the desired result.
In other words, above all we need commitment to, and the will to accept, a common process, and if the will is there then the reform of the treaties is certainly possible.
Neighbourhood policy is linked to enlargement of the Union in a certain way, but that is also an important policy area in itself, and so cannot be seen as a substitute for enlargement.
It is obvious that at least the countries interested in joining the EU will not accept a neighbourhood policy to compensate for or take the place of the prospect of EU membership.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we will be discussing this week's European Council and its agenda later on this afternoon, and I am quite sure that in that debate we will also return to those topics that have already been considered this morning.
Thank you, Commissioner, for that conclusion in French.
As for the rest, each of us will judge the content of the speech, which I, for my part, found interesting.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed for voting time at 12.05 p.m.)
Written statement (Rule 142)
Following the reaffirmation of the commitment to full implementation of the Thessaloniki agenda and of the intention to honour the existing commitments made to the candidate and potential candidate countries with regard to future enlargement, we still have to ensure that the Union is able to function.
By integrating new Member States, the Union has to face the consequent political, financial and institutional challenges it implies.
The Treaty of Nice does not provide an adequate basis for further enlargements, whereas the constitution offers solutions to most of the reforms needed and constitutes a tangible expression of the deepening enlargement relationship.
This is why it is necessary to settle the constitutional settlement before 2009 EP elections.
Reforms are necessary before any further enlargement takes place.
The enlargement process is a process that spreads democracy and wealth further across the European continent and beyond.
We therefore bear a responsibility towards our neighbourhood and particularly towards candidate and potential candidate countries.
Finally, while addressing the question of the Union's "absorption capacity", we share the point of view of the rapporteur who prefers the positive concept of "integration capacity".

Agenda: see Minutes
I must also inform you that, with regard to Mr Leinen's report on the amendment of Rules 15 and 182(1) of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure: Election of Quaestors and the Bureau of committees, the vote on which was scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday, in the end the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has not approved it pursuant to Rule 131, and we will therefore hold a debate on it as the final item of tonight's sitting.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I understand the need for security, but I must complain about the discourteous attitude and, frankly, even violent behaviour with which some security agents stopped us Members and barred our way outside this Chamber.
That is utterly unacceptable.
I understand the reasons for security, but I do think that there needs to be courtesy and respect for our roles on both sides.
The Secretary-General informs me that we have problems with certain auxiliaries who are involved in an emerging dispute.
The security officers are trying to ensure that everything takes place in its normal fashion, but we are facing difficulties as a result of the attitude of certain contracted workers who are affected by industrial arrangements.
Mr Zwiefka, my intention was to give the floor to Mr Florenz.
You are not raising a point of order relating to today's sitting.
(Protests)
Nevertheless, it is an important issue and I can tell you that the problem that you are referring to is also caused by alterations to the way the services are operating resulting from the industrial conflict that we are facing with certain session auxiliaries.
This problem has shown itself in the manner described by the previous speaker.
The picture was restored as soon as possible and at the press conference I was able to explain what had happened to the media, which had expressed the same concern as you.
Announcement by the President
I feel obliged to express my concern, and that of the whole of Parliament, I imagine, at the Conference on the Holocaust held in Teheran on 11 and 12 December.
(Loud applause)
On behalf of the plenary of the European Parliament, I would urge the Iranian Government to do what it must to prevent any act of anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia, discrimination or denial of historical events and their victims.
(Applause)

European Chemicals Agency (REACH) (vote)
- Before the vote:
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent result, for which I thank this House, will now be followed by a series of amendments not covered by the compromise.
I will agree with many of the amendments, but it is quite clear that voting for and adopting them would mean forcing us to go through conciliation for the sake of some marginal points, and that would really be the wrong thing to do, as it would put back the application of the regulation.
(Applause)
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on a point of order, I should like to point out to the Chamber that, in respect of this debate, two speeches have been made in which voting instructions have been given during the vote.
Please, this is a sensitive moment, and the positions of those who are going to vote in favour of the amendments, for example, should also be respected.
(Applause)
- Before the vote on Amendments 176 and 178:
(SV) Mr President, the rapporteur said that there will be conciliation if these amendments are adopted.
We do not know this for a fact, however.
If we approve the amendments, the Council may well accept them, but we will not know this until COREPER has made a decision.
There is thus no automatic link between adopting the amendments and conciliation.
(Applause)
- Before the vote on the common position:
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to say thank you once again.
In this House today, I think that Europe 'batte un colpo', as we say in Italian: it has scored a victory on a very sensitive subject for the people and for the companies involved.
(Applause)

- After the vote on Amendment 167:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I shall speak very briefly, since I have only a point about the translation to make.
In order to avoid misunderstandings in the translation of the term 'production aid' and to relate it explicitly to the German original term Produktionshilfen, I ask for a linguistic clarification to the effect that, where the words 'production aid' are used in the text, they should, in the English version, be replaced by the term 'production props', and rendered in the French one by aide matÃ©rielle Ã  la production, and in German by Produktionshilfen.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
(FR) Mr President, allow me to table a procedural motion: as is inevitably the case, there are many small problems, many slight contradictions between language versions in this text.
I support what Mrs Hieronymi just said: that we did not want to raise these problems.
We believe that, in such an important debate as this, the vote must be as simple as possible.
I would like it, instead, if, when the Commission hands over this text to the Council, these linguistic contradictions were removed: that is why I would like them to be recorded in our Minutes and to be taken into account, because every word counts in such an important matter as this.
- Before the vote on Amendment 160:
Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 166, on the question of admissibility of an amendment under Rule 151(3).
It concerns Amendment 160, tabled by Mr Wise on behalf of the IND/DEM Group, which calls for a massive extension of budgetary powers into areas of Member State sovereignty, namely: 'Member States' governments and institutions or the EU shall pay for those social policy information campaigns ...'.
Could you advise on this amendment's admissibility in the light of this massive extension of EU powers?
(Laughter and applause)
- Before the vote on Amendment 219:
Mr President, I may be completely wrong, but I do not think we have voted on the original text of recital 44.
We have voted on Amendment 44, and the original text has in fact been accepted.

Mr President, I wish to inform you and the House that, owing to the agreement with the Council on the globalisation fund, all seven amendments tabled by the PPE-DE Group have been withdrawn, which will make the vote shorter.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor.
It goes without saying that I am grateful to Mr Lewandowski for having withdrawn the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets: that is going to make our task much easier.
We are on the eve of an agreement at first reading, and this will be a triple victory: a victory for European workers, a victory for the proper functioning of our institutions and, I believe, a victory over ourselves, because we will have been able to overcome our political and national divisions.

Financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010) (vote)
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, I wish to thank the members of the Committee on Regional Development for the support they have given to this report.
I also wish to thank the Secretariat for its input.
Nothing I can say can adequately express the gratitude that the Irish people on both sides of the border feel for the investment that Europe has made for the economic regeneration of Northern Ireland, the border counties in the Irish Republic and the Northern Ireland Peace Process.
To date the International Fund for Ireland has contributed EUR 803 million of funding and has leveraged a further EUR 1.46 billion in supporting 5700 projects and the creation of 55 000 direct and indirect jobs.
It is has also played a crucial role in easing sectarian tensions and bridging the divisions between the two traditions on the island.
The guns are now hopefully permanently silent and the economies of Northern Ireland and the border counties of the south are beginning to realise their true economic potential.
This will be the last time that we will ask the EU for funding for this programme, as the International Fund will cease in 2010.
We have had many false dawns in the past regarding the permanent political solution in Northern Ireland.
However, my Irish colleagues and I are confident that we are, at long last, on the brink of a lasting solution and that a devolved government will soon become a reality for the long term.

Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2006-2007 (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 29:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I propose that we should adopt Amendment 29, but also incorporate an element from the original text, so that it would end up - as an addition to the Socialist amendment - reading: 'which make up the European identity' as a combination of both drafts.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 16:
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, we have to adapt our text to take account of the latest developments in the negotiations on Turkey.
We have tried to take the Socialist Group's Amendment 16 as a basis for this, and have put it into a form corresponding to the facts of the situation since Monday's Council of Foreign Ministers.
Although you have the amendment in printed form, I can read it out if you wish.
The rapporteur and the author of the amendment are agreed on this.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
- Before the vote on Amendment 17:
(EL) Mr President, in Amendment 17 tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I wish to change the term ' Northern Cyprus' to the term 'Turkish Cypriot Community'.
I discussed this with Mr Swoboda this morning and, as far as I understood, he accepts it.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
Mr President, this is not an objection to Mr Dimitrakopoulos' proposal, but I would like to add some other words to the same oral amendment.
After this morning's debate, and after the Council last Monday expressed its support for the renewed UN efforts to solve the Cyprus problem, I would like to add the following words to the oral amendment made by Mr Dimitrakopoulos: 'in close cooperation with renewed UN efforts'.
(Applause)
(The oral amendment was adopted)

The institutional aspects of the European Union's capacity to integrate new Member States (vote)
- Before the vote on Amendment 8:
rapporteur. - Mr President, on Amendment 8 which has been tabled by the PSE Group, the version we will follow is the French original language version which refers to the 'Lisbon Strategy'.
The English version talks about the 'social model', and of course the PSE Group did not mean that.
(The oral amendment was adopted)
That concludes the vote.
Implementation of Directive 85/611/EEC (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) (vote)
Explanations of vote
in writing. (SV) We are choosing to support the compromise that has been put forward as it represents a clear improvement on the existing legislation on chemicals.
Furthermore, it is our opinion that conciliation would have been risky, since we believe it likely that this would have resulted in a weaker REACH.
in writing. (SV) I abstained in today's vote on the second reading of REACH.
I did so because I cannot support the dilutions of Parliament's position, as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in October, that the Council has forced.
My criticism of the agreement revolves around three main points, which are as follows:
The substitution principle does not apply to all chemicals.
Instead, many chemicals, including carcinogenic substances, will continue to be exempted from the requirement for substitution, providing that they are 'properly controlled'.
The right to information is being watered down in that it covers fewer chemicals and will apply to concentrations higher than those deemed desirable by Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
The principle of responsibility is not being included in the actual body of the legislative text but is instead being pushed out to the preamble.
This is serious, especially for the many chemicals with little or no associated information requirement.
My abstention is not a failure but, rather, represents the laying down of a marker of my dissatisfaction with the Council's position.
I do not, however, wish to aim any criticism at the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi.
On the contrary, I would like to congratulate him most warmly for his splendid work on a difficult issue over a long period of time.
Today's vote paves the way for REACH to enter into force at the beginning of the second half of 2007.
My work, and that of many others, to improve this legislation further starts now.
in writing. - (FR) With today's vote, the EU has provided itself with a text, the scope of which is far from achieving the desired objectives.
The project was ambitious: to adopt legislation that will enable chemical substances to be registered and evaluated, with an obligation to substitute dangerous products with a less harmful alternative, where one exists.
This project has not withstood the pressure of certain lobbies from the chemical industry, strongly supported as it is within the European Parliament, which preferred to invoke economic constraints over environmental and public health protection in order to obtain less binding legislation, particularly on substitution.
I also regret the exclusion of endocrine disruptors from the substitution procedure and the fact that the chemical safety report should not be compulsory for substances weighing between one and ten tonnes.
The concluded agreement is inadequate, but to reject it would mean running the risk of starting the conciliation procedure and of ending up with a completely meaningless text.
As inadequate as it certainly is, this legislation does exist, and on the strength of that alone, it is well worth our getting more involved in terms of demanding financial and human resources to apply this legislation, to take it forward and to guarantee substitution on a very gradual basis.
We abstained from the vote on the compromise arising from an agreement between the two largest groups in Parliament - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in Parliament - because we feel that it does not meet the legitimate rights and concerns of the consumers and of small and medium-sized enterprises as regards protecting workers and the environment.
We believe that it does not strike the necessary balance between protecting workers' health, protecting the environment and industrial development.
Indeed, the rights of consumers have not been duly safeguarded, owing to the restrictions on the right to information; nor have the workers' right to good health been safeguarded, given that information is not made available on the potentially harmful effects of the materials they handle.
Furthermore, the report does not take proper account of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and even large companies that have already expressed a wish to replace dangerous chemicals, given that the cost of registering substances will inevitably rise, without suitable support provided.
That being said, we welcome the fact that the burden of proof has shifted onto industry.
This objective, which has now been achieved, underpinned the REACH objectives.
We regret, however, that some amendments tabled by our group were not accepted, including the possibility of Member States introducing more stringent measures should they wish to.
The text submitted to today's vote puts an end to seven long years of work and heated debates between, on the one hand, supporters of the chemical industry, who have persisted in overusing arguments of competitiveness and employment in order to maintain the status quo, guaranteeing, as it does, their own financial interests, and, on the other hand, European officials, who were anxious to come up with responsible legislation aimed at protecting Europeans from the perils of the dangerous chemical substances found in staple goods.
Of course, as is often the case, the outcome does not fully meet our demands.
Proof of this is the number of goods covered by the REACH regulation - only 30 000 out of the 100 000 desired.
Significant progress has been made, however, if we consider in particular the fact that only 3 000 substances are today being studied, and that it will be up to the chemical industry from now on to assume the burden of proof concerning the toxicity of substances, that is, to demonstrate that they are not harmful to humans.
In the end, thanks to the pugnacity of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, the European Union will have the world's most binding legislation on this matter.
That is why I emphatically endorsed the adoption of this text at second reading.
in writing. - (FR) I supported Mr Sacconi's compromise on REACH because it represents a big step forward for consumers, workers from the sector and even for the industry which, by adapting itself, is going to become the world leader in safer chemical substances.
Admittedly, REACH remains slightly too bureaucratic and does not always take account of the interests of medium-sized and, above all, small enterprises, which make Europe strong.
We need to make sure that neither the Commission nor the Agency give way to a precautionary principle that prevents any risks and any decisions from being taken, and that REACH - which is, in any case, a process stretching over 11 years - is intelligently implemented, which amounts to saying that we need to limit what are, essentially, useless studies and cumbersome procedures.
in writing.
(SV) The June List works to limit EU cooperation to truly cross-border matters. Such mattes include the internal market and various environmental issues.
We are convinced of the fact that a strong chemicals directive would constitute a long-term competitive advantage for Swedish and European industry.
We are therefore critical of the watered-down compromise put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
Under the compromise, the substitution principle has been practically eliminated.
Nor is there any legally binding principle of responsibility that would make it clear that the burden of proof is to be on companies, rather than on the authorities of the Member States.
The demand for the Member States to be able to adopt more far-reaching chemicals legislation has likewise failed to win approval.
This compromise may be a victory for those in the chemicals industry that are behind the times, but it is a defeat for modern and progressive companies, for public health and for our shared environment.
We have voted against this majority compromise on the strength of the views set out above.
We have voted to support the more environmentally friendly alternative, which is to say the compromise package put forward by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
in writing. - (FR) REACH is an extremely important step in terms of the EU's chemical policy.
The reversal of the duty of care principle, which shifts from the public authorities to industry and manufacturers, is a phenomenal revolution for the entire sector.
One cannot underestimate, either, the tremendous gain in knowledge that will result from the registration, evaluation and authorisation process.
This gain in knowledge will have consequences for industry as a whole and for our means of preserving humankind and the environment.
The only remaining big regret is that the principle of substitution for 'extremely worrying' chemical substances will not be as binding as one might have wished.
Let us hope that, in the near future, this principle will be taken up and accepted by the two European co-legislators and that we will not have to wait 20 years for that, as we have done for this directive.
To have rejected the entire REACH legislation because of this regret would have been like throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and that would certainly not have led to better legislation in the short or medium term.
I call on the future agency to remain pragmatic in its attitude towards certain well-known substances - such as lime, for example - the use of which does not, in principle, present any problems.
in writing. - (FR) This agreement on REACH will enable us to better protect health and the environment, and our European industry will have to become more responsible while remaining competitive in the world market.
The adopted text includes a number of important improvements: a reduction in red tape, a reduction in useless tests, better protection for businesses' confidential information and the introduction of a compulsory substitution plan.
This regulation is going to enable legislation to be made clearer: the chemicals sector is currently subject to around 40 European directives.
This regulation is going to enable the European Chemicals Agency to register more than 30 000 chemical substances over the next 11 years.
I do, however, regret that a long-lasting solution should not have been found to the problem of imports from third countries.
Indeed, European importers of chemicals must register them, under a procedure subject to REACH.
The problem really lies in the importing of finished goods, the substances contained in which will simply be notified.
in writing. - (FR) It is very important for the European Union to have a harmonised system for registering, authorising and controlling chemical substances.
One Member State on its own cannot establish an effective system.
This system must make it possible, on the one hand, to reduce the risks to our health and our environment, and, on the other hand, to promote innovation and support for economic activities that are non-polluting.
The compromise voted on today successfully rises to the challenge of an ambitious piece of legislation, the principal aim of which is to create an effective system for protecting individuals, without hindering economic development.
in writing. I supported the initiative by my group and other members, which was a compromise that would have preserved the best of the REACH proposal whilst answering many of the concerns of business.
As things stand the new legislation is full of loopholes and exemptions and my concern is that this will allow the use of toxic chemicals in manufacturing to continue, even when safer alternatives exist.
in writing. - (FR) I am not thrilled, and I would have preferred a different version of this text, which remains a real bureaucratic monster, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
While the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the left are strongly criticising me and are going as far as to claim that I am defending the chemical industry at the expense of public health, the chemical industry and, above all, the small and medium-sized enterprises in this sector are accusing us of imposing legislation on them that is costly and difficult to manage, which could lead to large businesses relocating outside Europe and which is liable, above all, to threaten the survival of SMEs.
Some chemical substances, like some of the 130 substances used in the manufacturing of tyres, might no longer be able to be used in Europe, with the result that they would be integrated into finished goods imported from third countries, thus escaping all checks.
An overly perfect REACH is therefore just as dangerous as an extreme REACH because it would be liable to do away with thousands of jobs in Europe without, for all that, helping to improve public health.
One advantage of REACH is that this regulation combines 40 existing directives, which is an improvement geared towards promoting the single market.
The REACH issue is one of the most talked about and lobbied issues in the history of the EU.
Both industry and environmental organisations have already taken a critical view of the result.
Nevertheless, I regard the compromise between the Council and Parliament as viable and balanced.
The agreement that has been reached strikes the right balance between economic interests and care for the environment.
Harmful substances must, where possible, be banned, and I am all for industry making funds for this purpose available, as long as the burden - particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises - is not too heavy.
The directive provides for this by encouraging the replacement of harmful substances by alternatives and by supporting the SMEs when adaptations are made in line with the updated rules and regulations.
With fewer animal tests and better information for the consumer, the directive is a step in the right direction.
Once the dust has cleared, I am convinced that many opponents will gradually come round to showing their support for the directive.
in writing.
(DE) SMEs and those who work for them cannot be satisfied with everything in the REACH compromise, which incorporates neither Parliament's proposal for less stringent testing where small quantities are involved, nor the concept of better-defined categories of exposure and use, the consequence of which is that the EU is imposing considerable costs on businesses and making them less competitive.
Despite these considerable defects, I have voted in favour of the compromise, since it also bears the stamp of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the opinion of which I drafted, and on the grounds that the new directive creates Europe-wide legal certainty by replacing forty individual regulations, considerably improves information on 30 000 substances, and reduces to a minimum the safety risks for consumers and workers in the chemical industry.
The introduction of a safety report for substances produced in quantities of less than ten tonnes annually has been dispensed with, thereby freeing SMEs in particular from the substantial cost and effort involved in documentation.
There has been a marked improvement in the protection of industrial confidentiality, and it is possible for particularly hazardous substances to be permitted without a time limit, thereby avoiding bottlenecks in supply; the extension of the registration deadline for the first stage to three and a half years is another tangible relief for the chemicals industry.
The directive is due to enter into force in 2007, and the success of its transposition depends on good cooperation between the central chemical agency, the national authorities, and businesses.
in writing. - (IT) I am delighted to be able to highlight the success of the trialogue.
Despite its barbarous name, it succeeded in finding an honourable solution to the issue of registering chemical substances, as regards both safeguarding consumers' health and protecting the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises.
I hope that the compromise reached last week will be approved by this Chamber, thus concluding the work done over three years to bring the 40 existing pieces of legislation together into a single regulation.
I am grateful to my fellow Members for accepting some amendments tabled by my group to protect small and medium-sized enterprises and animal welfare.
The complexity of the regulation means, amongst other things, that safety assessments will be carried out on about 30 000 substances placed on the marked before 1981 and produced or imported in amounts exceeding one tonne per year.
That prospect is a further guarantee to safeguard human health.
Despite the considerable number of new provisions, many application-related aspects have yet to be settled in order to make it feasible for REACH to be properly implemented in certain sectors, such as cosmetics, for instance.
A great many points have been the subject of debate, as shown by the hundreds of amendments examined, but the end result is, in my view, very well balanced.
For that reason, too, I have voted in favour of the final compromise.
It has taken five years but the EU appears finally ready to pass a law on this important issue.
Given that so much time has passed, it is essential we vote for a compromise, even if we may not support it in its entirety.
This is particularly important, given that what has effectively been achieved here is a tricky, yet vital, balance between protecting the consumers' various interests, protecting the needs of European industry (which, in addition to employing thousands of Europeans, is crucial to the competitiveness of our economy) and protecting the environment.
Otherwise, if in doubt, we must follow the consumers' interests, because it is vital to them that a competitive industry can be maintained whilst protecting the environment.
We therefore voted in favour of this report.
I have one other comment, however, which is that five years is too long.
We sometimes waste time on issues that do not carry the same weight and significance as this one, and we are sometimes left without time to commit ourselves to what is most important to our economy.
We should be mindful of this, I believe, when we discuss the EU's problems.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the compromise reached with the Council on 30 November concerning REACH, following in the footsteps of the three large political groups (the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe). I did this so that our fellow citizens might quickly have legislation - the entry into force of which is scheduled for 1 April 2007 - controlling the use of chemical substances in our staple goods.
Admittedly, this compromise is less ambitious than the one to which I aspired in taking a stand, at first reading, in favour of the compulsory substitution of 'extremely worrying' chemical substances where safer alternatives exist.
Nevertheless, as the fruit of three years of preparation and of difficult negotiations, this compromise represents a weak, but necessary, balance between the need for health and environmental protection and the competitiveness of businesses.
I hope, however, that the framework provided by REACH will make it possible, in spite of everything, for the substitution process to be genuinely recognised, even if, in practice, a high number of toxic substances are going to slip through the net.
It is the act of monitoring and controlling the implementation of this regulation that will help to consolidate a stronger version of REACH.
in writing. - (FR) We voted against the REACH regulation on chemical substances at first reading, in the belief that the adopted amendments would not make it possible to maintain the balance struck between the three objectives of this regulation: health and environmental protection; competitiveness and innovation; and the substitution of dangerous substances with less harmful or innocuous alternatives.
The compromise proposed to us today is not a great deal more balanced.
Admittedly, it includes some significant advances, as many speakers pointed out during the debate: simplified registrations; a more practical approach; and some, albeit insufficient, progress for SMEs, for example.
However, it also has some gaps and ambiguities, not least concerning the constraints on imports and the potential disadvantages of this for European manufacturers, and also concerning the application of the substitution principle solely to dangerous substances, which is already a step forward, but which does not guarantee its effectiveness even in cases where technically and economically viable alternatives exist.
Exchanging one imbalance for another is not resolving the problem.
None of the three initial aims of the directive will truly be achieved, any more, I might add, than the aim to simplify the legislation or to make it compatible with other Community legislation will be achieved.
I am pleased to have seen confirmed today an improved proposal to deal with the crucial issues raised under the REACH report.
In particular the use of animal testing, which is of great concern to many of my constituents, has been changed to incorporate validation of alternatives.
Also, a three-year review allows for the European Commission to consider whether legislative proposals covering this area could be useful to reduce further any need for such testing.
Similarly, the improved text which I voted for today reflects more accurately the views of thousands of individuals and interest groups in dealing with the cumulative effects of toxic chemicals found in hundreds of household products.
Mr President, after so much work over such a long period this package does not merit the backslapping and self congratulation we have seen today.
The alternative package put forward by my group would have worked, and implemented a new regime which would have protected consumers and balanced the needs of business and the economy which must of course be included in our plans.
Today's package will not do what it says on the tin, and it is a shame that MEPs from the Labour and Conservative groups did not join us to bring in a better package.
I cannot possibly be upbeat about the REACH proposal that has been rushed through Parliament.
The Commission, the Council and Parliament have all been dazzled by economic profit and have displayed sure signs of apathy.
For the first time in many years, the EU had the opportunity to create legislation the usefulness of which would have been plain for all citizens to see: strict, complex, but at the same time concrete and always putting the health of all its residents first.
The half-hearted approach towards harmful chemical substances leaves neither industry nor the public satisfied.
It is for that very reason that some regard it as a 'sound compromise'.
It is not one.
It would be tantamount to claiming that halving the thickness of the Berlin wall would have been a good solution.
You cannot trifle with public health.
There is no middle ground. Even a little more healthy is still ill.
In Flanders, things have now got to such a pass that harmful substances can be found everywhere.
Whilst we know that in many cases, this is unhealthy, we do not know precisely why.
A sound REACH would have solved this and would, for example, make Flanders healthy in the medium term.
The proposal that has now been voted on does not do this.
After all, being more healthy by half is not an option.
The Regulation, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) is crucial in the protection of public health.
This legislation is particularly important in relation to babies' health through breast-feeding.
Breast milk, the best source of essential nutrients for a baby, is currently being affected by dangerous chemicals found in the environment, passing through the mother's body.
Through REACH, such harmful chemicals would be substituted with safer alternatives where possible.
Manufacturers would have a duty of care to protect human health and the environment.
In addition to this, REACH promotes both increased transparency in the case of, and alternatives to, animal testing.
The compromise reached today is the best we could hope for.
First of all, I should like to highlight the excellent work done by the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi.
I decided to vote in favour of the compromise amendment between the Council and Parliament mainly because this amendment is going to allow certain dangerous products to be controlled better, while making the chemical industry more competitive.
While it is true that this compromise is not perfect, I believe that, if it had not been adopted, the situation would have been more complicated.
This compromise provides for the compulsory replacement of the most dangerous substances where alternatives exist, the recognition of a 'duty of care' on the part of manufacturers and the promotion of methods other than animal testing.
This version of the text certainly does not go as far as the text submitted at first reading, but, if the text had been rejected, we would have had to go through the conciliation stage, which would have led to other, less advantageous conclusions.
That is why I thought it wiser to vote for this version of the text, which is admittedly imperfect, but which does nonetheless enable progress to be made and more extensive checks to be carried out on chemicals that we come across in our daily lives.
in writing. - (FR) This fund is a new tool: for the first time, the EU will no longer come to the aid just of business and local authorities, but indeed directly to that of employees who have lost their jobs because of relocations.
This is all the more so because the European Parliament wanted to extend the profits of this fund to 'small labour markets' where redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local economy.
This opportunity offers promising prospects to the most vulnerable areas of my region, which is something that I welcome.
Equally, I welcome the unwavering commitment of the members of the Socialist Party in the European Parliament, who have taken a strong and tenacious stand in defending the implementation of this tool and tabled many amendments aimed at extending the implementation, amount and number of beneficiaries thereof.
This is the first step towards a more social and more united Europe.
The EU cannot, however, merely 'heal the wounds' of globalisation.
Today, Europeans expect Europe to help keep their jobs and their lifestyles secure, in the same way that it has been able to guarantee peace and stability for almost 50 years.
in writing. The adoption of this legislation is a big step forward for the protection of people and the environment from potentially dangerous chemicals.
Some argue that it should have been better, and there is indeed a case for saying that a compromise such as this is not perfect.
However, a common set of rules on this important matter is better than a patchwork of perfect (but divergent) rules in some countries, half measures in others and no rules at all elsewhere - in what is supposed to be a common market with common rules.
That would have given less protection at greater costs.
in writing. - (FR) The members of Mouvement pour la France in the European Parliament have refused to support the compromise proposed for the vote at second reading on the draft directive on dangerous substances, the so-called REACH Directive.
Now that the directive has been examined by the various European institutions, there is little left of its original good intentions.
Thus, the compromise text voted on this morning is very inadequate in terms of environmental and consumer protection.
Furthermore, the new burdens that it places on European businesses are not compensated for by similar obligations imposed on imports of finished goods, creating a distortion of competition that jeopardises European industry.
I voted in favour of the Sacconi report on the amendment to Directive 67/548/EEC on dangerous substances (REACH), at second reading, because I feel that the common position adopted by the Council is a good agreement that will benefit the citizens of the European Union.
I feel that this is a well-balanced legislative proposal that has sought to strike a balance between safeguarding the industry's legitimate interests, and especially those of the SMEs, with the need to protect the environment and public health.
The REACH agreement will guarantee, as of June 2007, that substances that are extremely problematic from an environmental and public health perspective are substituted wherever possible by safe alternative substances or technologies.
I voted for the compromise amendments on this report and against all others.
I did so to avoid the REACH Directive going into conciliation where I felt it was far from certain to emerge as a piece of legislation.
Many of the amendments had much to commend them but they would have threatened the directive as a whole - as so often in politics the best would have been the enemy of the good.
(DE) Mr President, the basic idea of ensuring that, in certain cases, materials that give a great deal of cause for concern are replaced by materials or technologies that are less hazardous, provided that economically suitable and technically feasible alternatives are available, is a good one, although, in doing this, particular attention needs to be given to this regulation's potential effects on small and medium-sized businesses and on the jobs they provide.
Since, however, it has proved possible to arrive at a compromise that obviates these dangers, a vote in favour of this report has been made possible.
(NL) Mr President, what I saw as important about the report was that it considered all the options and alternatives with a view to reducing the number of animal tests to a minimum.
Since the suffering involved in tests on animals - and on mammals in particular - worries many European citizens, the use of such tests should, where possible, be avoided at all costs.
The European Centre for validating alternative methods has been given an important role in this.
This institution will, with more funds, need to produce plenty of validated alternatives in order to put an end to animal tests in the long term.
We would also argue in favour of transparency and clarity in respect of the numbers of animals and types of tests carried out by research labs.
(NL) Mr President, it is, of course, difficult to be enthusiastic about a text and a vote that are very complex and on which we will, in fact, be unable to pass a verdict until we have had the time to reread it at our leisure; I in any event have the impression that we have succeeded in striking a balance between respecting our chemical industry's ambition to be competitive on the one hand and the care and attention that are so necessary for our public health on the other.
We cannot, in any case, do other than note with satisfaction that it has become clear in recent years that our chemical industry is acutely aware of its responsibilities and that it has taken on the burden of proof and accepted the principle of duty of care.
I should like to make one final remark.
In the case of substances for which there is no alternative, whose use is completely controllable and where the duty to substitute would cause considerable economic damage, it would, I think, be extremely regrettable if our industry were to relocate to competing regions on account of our obsession with rules and regulations.
(SK) Following the discussions on this extensive and challenging piece of legislation, which has taken three years to prepare, many of us in this House were of two minds as to what we should do about REACH.
Should we support the compromise package, the common position, or turn down the proposal?
On the one hand, environmentalists view the compromise package as too weak; on the other hand, it poses a threat to the chemical industry, particularly SMEs, by threatening competitiveness and jobs.
I have thoroughly considered all the arguments of the stakeholders and voted in favour of the compromise package, which bears the distinctive imprint of the European Parliament, since I am convinced that we need rules in order to know more about the thirty thousand chemical substances in the products that surround us in our everyday lives.
We need to replace forty obsolete norms with a single regulation for chemicals covering registration, evaluation, authorisation and, last but not least, restrictions.
We need a strong impetus for European research to ensure the gradual and natural elimination of harmful substances where this regulation does not prescribe substitution.
I am convinced that this piece of legislation marks a correct step towards improving the quality of life for European citizens.
(DE) Mr President, I, too, would like to emphasise that this compromise would certainly have been capable of being improved, particularly as regards substitution, the rules on which we found to be lamentably unclear, but experience with their implementation will be the main way of showing whether they are usable in practice.
This is where the Member States, the Commission and the Chemicals Agency - which is now to be established - need to do something for businesses, and we, in this House, will certainly have to keep a watchful eye out to see that they do a proper job of it.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the draft regulation on dangerous substances, otherwise known as REACH.
However, I have a number of doubts as to whether the compromise achieved, following lengthy and difficult negotiations, will contribute to the protection of human health and the environment on the one hand, and to encouraging competition and innovation within the chemical industry in the European Union on the other.
I firmly believe that we should gradually withdraw dangerous chemicals from the market in stages, and replace them with less dangerous substances.
However, we should be aware that new, restrictive requirements will have a negative impact on European industry, especially on small and medium-sized enterprises.
They will have to pay the majority of the costs of adjusting to the legislation.
We should therefore think about how to support them.
The new regulations should also be applied to imports from third countries and so should be discussed at WTO level.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, REACH is in fact an example of how not to do it.
It is not an example of better lawmaking in the EU, and it is for that reason that I have not voted in favour of our new legislation on chemicals.
Much will now be dependent on the management of the new Chemicals Agency, but, whatever happens, things look set to get bureaucratic, with over 5 000 pages of rules and regulations putting Europe's small and medium-sized businesses in particular at a disadvantage.
REACH is no answer to the demand - repeated paternoster fashion in the EU - for better, in other words simpler, legislation.
It is dubious whether it actually does anything to protect the consumer, but certain that it will impose additional burdens on European businesses.
This is a fundamental problem, and we would be well advised to steer clear of this sort of legislative project in future.
(DE) Mr President, it is a good thing that REACH takes, as its primary purpose, the protection of human life, of jobs and of the environment, but the way in which the protection of people and their environment is organised will have adverse effects on Europe, resulting in a massive build-up of bureaucracy, several thousand pages worth of superfluous regulations, and, in the long term, the relocation of jobs and a consequent reduction in the active workforce.
I do not see this as something that we, in Europe, should be voting for.
Less employment and more bureaucracy make for the sort of Europe that we do not want.
The decision was made difficult by the fact that the Compromise 191 with which we were presented was preferable to the alternative that was already on the table, and, that being so, I have neither voted to adopt this poor compromise nor opted for outright rejection.
It is for that reason that I have abstained from voting.
in writing. - (FR) Closely linked as it is to the ambition to build a European Union that gathers together the nations, intercultural dialogue today represents an important dimension of numerous Community policies and instruments.
That is why I welcome the adoption at second reading of the decision to implement a European Year 2008, which will be dedicated to intercultural dialogue.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs at first reading, I hope that this European Year will enable all Europeans, particularly young people, to become aware of the need for intercultural dialogue in their everyday lives.
It must highlight best practice in this field, with the specific aim of integrating immigrants, and should do so by continuing the actions undertaken in 2007 during the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
Thus, the promotion of intercultural dialogue should continue within the European Union far beyond 2008, as the adopted text calls for.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that the whole idea of a European Year of this or that is unnecessary and not something that EU taxpayers should fund.
To invest EUR 10 million in a European Year of Intercultural Dialogue would be quite reprehensible, and it is difficult and perhaps even impossible to see what would be the point of doing so.
We are voting against the amendments to the report in accordance with the view we expressed previously when voting against the report at first reading.
in writing. (HU) I wish to highlight the amendment proposed by Parliament emphasising the cultural and educational aims of the renewed Lisbon Strategy, as well as the need to disseminate information concerning equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination within the European Union.
In this regard I would like to call to mind a phenomenon that brings to the fore the urgent need for intercultural dialogue, namely the situation of migrants, and in particular of migrant women.
According to Eurostat, the proportion of women amongst migrants is steadily increasing.
They currently make up almost 54 per cent of all migrants.
What makes the problem even more serious is the fact that they face quite high levels of unemployment.
Their dependency is further aggravated by the fact that a considerable number of migrants live on the margins of society and their access to public, political and economic life is very limited.
Amongst migrant populations, female migrants are victims of a double discrimination, on grounds of both gender and ethnic origin.
The major problems faced by migrants, that is, unemployment, exclusion from education and a position of legal uncertainty also weigh most heavily on women and children.
It is tragic that around five thousand migrant women fall victim annually to mental or physical violence, forced marriage, genital mutilation and crimes committed in the name of honour.
In my view, it is of particular significance that the European Commission has designated 2007 as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, and 2008 as the Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
It is my hope that these programmes will provide an opportunity to deal with all these problems and, as far as possible, to find solutions to them.
It is for this reason that I, together with the Minister of Social and Employment Affairs, announced a series of programmes in Hungary on the occasion of the 2007 Year of Equal Opportunities.
The reduced budget implementation of the Structural and Cohesion Funds is one of the reasons for submitting this amending budget for 2006.
Due to non-implementation, it has been proposed that EUR 2.5 billion in payment appropriations be cancelled, under the following budgetary headings: EUR 1.5 billion under the European Regional Development Fund; EUR 500 million under the European Social Fund; and EUR 500 million under the Cohesion Fund.
Regardless of the reasons behind the Commission's proposal to cancel funds earmarked for cohesion policy for this reduction, we have seen that this is normal practice.
What is needed, therefore, is to assess properly the reasons behind the reduction in budgetary implementation and to not allow this necessary assessment - for example, of the impact of the nominal criteria enshrined in the Stability Pact on public investment in the Member States, and of the reduction in Member State contributions to the Community budget - to be used as a pretext for reducing the amount of money set aside every year in the Community budget for the Structural and Cohesion Funds.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you, Mr President, for having given me the floor to explain the reasons for my vote on the Hieronymi report on television broadcasting activities, which I consider very important and well produced.
By voting for the report I was expressing my personal hope and that of all the pensioners in Italy and Europe that, in future, particular attention will be paid in television programming to the dignity and the involvement of the elderly in the world of culture.
It is very nice to see young people in television programmes, and it is also nice for the elderly to see so many attractive men and women, but I think it is important that the qualities of older people should also be aired on television.
in writing. (SV) We voted against the report on the proposal for a directive governing audiovisual media services.
Common EU regulations governing television broadcasts and other audiovisual media are necessary in an increasingly borderless Europe. However, we believe that such a directive must guarantee a high level of protection for consumers, particularly when it comes to advertising aimed at children or for alcoholic beverages.
It should, furthermore, be possible for the receiving country to influence the content of programmes aimed specifically at that country.
The result of the vote is much too much liberalisation of the rules on advertising.
What is more, Sweden's ban on advertising aimed at children and on advertising of alcohol is in danger of being undermined, and that is unacceptable.
British Conservative members of the EPP-ED Group support the Hieronymi report - C6-0443/2005 - particularly because it includes support for co- and self-regulation and the 30-minute rule for advertising slots.
The other important aspects of country of origin principle, product placement and short extracts have been substantially modified by the rapporteur since the Commission published its original text.
We should like to congratulate Ruth Hieronymi on her diligence in the many public hearings, which included the appropriate regulatory and commercial interests from the United Kingdom, and on her producing a balanced, practicable and enduring piece of work incorporating many improvements suggested by colleagues.
Unlike the other Dutch Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am in favour of Amendments 170, 156 and 177, which aim to restrict advertising for unhealthy foods intended for children, and my arguments in favour of this position are as follows.
1.
In the EU, one in four children is obese as a consequence of incorrect diet combined with a lack of sufficient exercise.
Obese children have a bad start in life in terms of both their social and physical development.
Research shows that advertising impacts greatly on consumption and buying behaviour.
2.
There is wide public support for restricting advertising for unhealthy foods.
The Food Centre, the Heart Foundation and the Consumer Association all argue in favour of a ban on television commercials for unhealthy foods intended for young children.
Opinion polls (Food Centre) and surveys (in the Saturday 2 December edition of the Algemeen Dagblad) show that nearly half of all parents are in favour of restricting or banning aggressive advertising.
3.
The question is, of course, whether this situation requires a legal ban or self-regulation.
My personal preference would be self-regulation, unless it turned out that codes of conduct were ineffective.
Moreover, it is debatable whether a restriction or ban would be best imposed nationally or at European level.
I would in any event be in favour of this being allowed at national level.
With this Television Directive, we must avoid ending up in a situation where Member States no longer have a say in these matters.
Since the Television Directive is being tabled for first reading, it is not yet a final legal document.
This is why it is better at this stage to endorse the amendments that move in the right direction and that also give the Netherlands the best chances of retaining the right to restrict advertising.
This would carry a political message to the effect that the health of children is more important than the commercial interests of the food industry.
The objective is purportedly to amend the existing directive on the pretext of the evolution of television, but the real purpose is to ensure that profits can be safeguarded for private television companies.
A number of studies have demonstrated that people are watching fewer advertisements, on the grounds that they can change channel and this is why advertisement breaks are increasingly shown at the same time across the various channels.
Profits from advertising are not as high as they were, because the channels cannot guarantee audiences to those buying advertising, and everything in television is measured in audience figures.
Consequently, advertising has to be reinvented so that profits can still be made, for example through product placement, split screen, promotions, virtual advertising and interactive advertising.
The same happens with the amount of programme time in which advertising can be shown.
There were also a number of proposals on high-calorie food and drink advertising when children's programmes are being shown.
Accordingly, given that the positions that are least favourable to the people were adopted and that the most vulnerable sections of society have not been protected, we did not vote in favour of this report.
in writing. (SV) The June List rejects the Commission's proposal.
The Council dealt with this matter in November, prior to first reading in the European Parliament now, in December.
A compromise was agreed on, but this compromise was not supported by seven countries, including Sweden.
Sweden - and the June List - question what is known as the country of origin principle, according to which a television company has to follow the regulations in place in the country from which it broadcasts, irrespective of where its programmes are viewed, because this leads to problems when, for example, TV 3 and Kanal 5 broadcast from the United Kingdom where they are covered by British, rather than Swedish, legislation.
Sweden has been fighting in the Council for the right of the receiving country to take measures against TV companies that broadcast from a different EU country in order to deliberately circumvent national rules.
The Committee on Culture and Education has tabled an amendment relating to cases where a media service provider has established itself in the Member State having jurisdiction 'in order to avoid the stricter rules in the fields' coordinated by the directive.
We would, however, have liked to have seen the matter discussed further in order to have achieved a stronger form of words.
Sweden and the June List believe that both advertising aimed at children and that relating to alcohol should be completely prohibited.
We have attempted, as far as possible, to vote to improve the directive in accordance with the guidelines above.
I voted against in the final vote on TV broadcasting, because I believe that programmes will be overrun by advertisements as a result of this report.
I regret that Parliament rejected attempts to ban junk food advertising during children's programmes.
Today's vote will undoubtedly lead to a deterioration in the quality of programmes in the EU.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the version of the directive on audiovisual services as amended by the rapporteur's compromise amendments because they make the directive viable and reasonable.
The country of origin principle firmly rooted in this directive is of the utmost importance.
It will enable television channels to have their headquarters in a Member State and to broadcast their programmes in all the EU Member States from that Member State.
Furthermore, I consider the compromise on product placement to be viable, given that it guarantees independent European producers revenue while protecting consumers from any undue excesses and keeping away from children's programmes.
As regards commercial breaks, I voted in favour of a 30-minute interval because this is realistic given the average length of television programmes in Europe.
This interval guarantees private channels an adequate income, thanks to which they can continue funding programme production.
I support the authorisation of one-off advertising spots for the same reasons.
Stricter restrictions on advertising, as proposed by the left of this Parliament, would have harmful consequences for European television productions and would lead to a significant loss of revenue for private channels, estimated at some EUR 200 million per year.
I voted for this report and in favour of amendments that allow Member States to take action to protect minors, to restrict the timing of alcohol advertising and the advertisements for unhealthy food.
I also supported an amendment that allows a Member State to take action against a broadcaster who sets up in another Member State intentionally to get round national legislation.
On Amendment 226, which deals with a code of conduct on advertising of foods aimed at children, I voted against as I do not think this amendment is strong enough in its wording to get Member States to address the urgent concerns about increasing obesity levels in children.
I supported Amendment 170 in order to put down a marker that there is a need to control the issue of marketing of unhealthy foodstuffs to children.
On Amendment 169 relating to alcohol, I support calls for a ban on alcohol advertising until after 9 p.m., notwithstanding that in Ireland we do have a strong voluntary code in place.
A review of the first year of the code is due in March 2007 and this will assist us in making decisions about the effectiveness or otherwise of such codes.
By resisting the temptation to regulate everything, to impose its will on everything and to control everything, Parliament has succeeded in making a positive contribution to this proposal for a directive.
Naturally, in the search for balance and compromise, some relevant aspects have fallen by the wayside, or have been less well regulated.
In the case of non-linear services, I believe that we have gone further than was needed at this stage of knowledge and experience in the field.
Furthermore, the solutions reached are balanced despite the well known fervour on the part of some Members of this House for excessive regulation.
In the case of radio broadcasting, the consumer is becoming increasingly powerful.
This is something positive that should be taken more into account.
The rule should be that the facts should be made clear to consumers and that they should then be allowed to act accordingly.
For these reasons, I feel that, broadly speaking, the consumers' and the industry's interests have been duly taken into account, and this fully justifies my vote in favour.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of Mrs Hieronymi's excellent report on the revision of the European Television without Frontiers Directive with a view to integrating brilliant technological innovations into it.
I am pleased that the directive maintains the ceiling on production quotas of European works and the protection of minors in the face of certain excesses.
Promoting cultural diversity and European values of tolerance also means standing in the way of incitement to hatred, whatever the means used to spread it: satellite television or the Internet.
That is why I supported the amendments that recommend extending 'filtering' to 'non-linear' services: that is the best way, in future, of preventing programmes justifying terrorism from being broadcast on European soil.
Finally, I commend the resolutely modern vote cast today by the European Parliament, which recognises the significant contribution of advertising to the creation of quality independent works and of entertaining television that meets Europeans' expectations.
I would also point out that it is commercial broadcasters that are setting an example: with more than 30% of programmes being commissioned to independent producers, not only are they broadly meeting the quota of 10% laid down by the directive, but, above all, they are spending twice as much as their competitors in the public sector.
Advertising on TV for alcohol and tobacco products are a part of this directive's concerns.
Yet product placement of these products has been treated differently in this vote today.
I voted to keep tobacco off TV screens and to limit alcohol advertising.
However, although tobacco was prohibited, alcohol failed to get sufficient votes.
Given the distress caused by alcohol in many families' lives across the EU, as well as related ill-health issues, I find this result unsatisfactory.
In particular we must keep youngsters from being exposed to enticements to drink.
Enormous changes are afoot in the audiovisual industry, and so, in that sense, the overhaul of the Television without Frontiers Directive is a good thing.
The distinction that is drawn between linear (traditional TV, Internet, mobile telephony) and non-linear - that is to say, on-demand - services requires us to formulate basic protection rules for young people to prevent the incitement of racial hatred or clandestine advertising.
The text as approved contains good and bad elements.
The good ones include, inter alia, a regulation on the transmission of short excerpts from football matches or other events.
The proposal to introduce a minimum time during which programmes may not be interrupted by advertising (45 minutes) is also justifiable.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance regrets that the proposal to restrict commercial breaks to at most three per hour did not make it to the finishing line, and that product placement is shrouded in ambiguity.
We shall leave it up to the Member States to decide on this.
The line between 'product placement' and 'production aid' is very thin, and that will make doubt and controversy inevitable.
Moreover, the Greens regret that the teeth have been removed from the proposal to restrict advertising for unhealthy foods during children's programmes.
It is also unfortunate that the reference to pluralism and prevention of media concentration has only been included in the recitals and not in the articles.
The health of children in Europe must be one of our key concerns.
Therefore the marketing of foods high in sugar, salt and fat to children undermines efforts in the fight against child obesity, a problem faced by one in five children in the European Union.
Such marketing makes it increasingly difficult for parents to encourage healthy eating: limits on such marketing are therefore imperative in tackling this problem.
Furthermore, European Ministers (in November) and the EP Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (last week) approved the World Health Organization's call for the introduction of strict legislation in this area.
We as legislators must do all that we can to protect children's health and place a ban on the advertising of these types of unhealthy products to children.
Also, I fully back the amendment which would have restricted the advertising of alcohol to after 9 p.m. in the evening.
It is with grave disappointment that I note that the vote today did not go far enough in protecting children's health.
I decided to vote in favour of the Hieronymi report because it includes many advances in the area of television broadcasting.
I welcome, among other things, the adoption of Amendment 227 prohibiting product placement in news and current affairs programmes, political broadcasts, children's programmes, documentaries and programmes of advice, and permitting it under strict conditions in cinematographic works, films, series made for television and sports broadcasts.
I do, however, have two major criticisms to make of this report.
I regret the fact that Parliament has voted by a margin of one vote to interrupt the transmission of films made for television, cinematographic works, children's programmes and news and current affairs programmes with commercial breaks every 30 minutes instead of every 45 minutes, as voted for in the Committee on Culture and Education.
Furthermore, I regret the vote on Amendment 221 concerning derogations from the country of origin principle, which permits the Member States to adopt more detailed or stricter rules; this amendment is a danger to cultural diversity, a principle that the European Parliament has a duty to protect.
(DE) Mr President, globalisation - which is what this is all about - is happening whether we want it to or not, and it goes hand in hand with the opening-up of markets, with international competition, with economic growth, with the creation of new jobs, but, unfortunately also with the loss of jobs in those sectors that are less competitive.
In the light, though, of the need to seize the opportunities presented by globalisation, and to support those workers who are adversely affected by it, the establishment of this 'European Adjustment Fund' is a very good thing.
The delegation of the Austrian People's Party, however, with its knowledge of the structure and size of Austrian businesses, has demanded an amendment to the effect that the Fund would become active as soon as 500 - rather than 1 000 - workers were laid off, and should give out a commensurate amount in funds.
We see all the other measures - ranging from microloans to training - in a positive light - and the report as a whole therefore enjoys our support.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving me the floor for the second time on this important document by Mrs Bachelot, which quite rightly seeks to protect us citizens of Europe from the problems of globalisation.
I voted for the report, hoping in this case that, because of globalisation, action will be taken for us not only in the form of financial aid, in cash, but also in the form of cultural aid.
That is to say that, in my view, it is important for us to realise that globalisation also means a single world, and so I tell the elderly that they must realise not only that they live in a national State, but also that they live in the world, and that in this world all elderly people, as well as all young people, need something.
in writing. (SV) The increased competition amongst companies and the increased opportunities for new, cheaper and better products for consumers that globalisation brings make new demands in relation to flexibility, new thinking and adaptability.
It is by striving to be better, more efficient and quicker that we will meet the new demands and opportunities presented by globalisation.
The effect of the Globalisation Fund already set up will be the opposite.
It will put the brakes on regeneration and delay adaptation without taking advantage of the opportunities that globalisation provides.
There is no doubt that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) will be a worthwhile financial instrument offering a European-level response to job losses caused by the opening up of the markets and by increased pressure from international competition.
Redundancies are one of the principal adverse effects brought about by the phenomenon of (economic) globalisation, alongside the acknowledged benefits.
I am bitterly disappointed, however, that the objective of setting up the EGF, under the terms of the Commission's proposal, is to enable the Community to offer support with the aim of reinstating the jobs solely of workers who have lost their jobs due to significant structural changes in world trade.
This view demonstrates a misunderstanding of the phenomenon of globalisation.
It overlooks the fact that, apart from the liberalisation of world trade, the freedom of movement of capital and the deregulation of the market, which are also driving forces behind globalisation, they too could lie at the root of the job losses attributed to globalisation.
Against this backdrop, I tabled several amendments to the proposal, in the context of the opinion issued by the Committee on Regional Development, for which Mrs Madeira was responsible.
Although the report before us maintains the scope of the EGF, it also introduces a series of amendments to the Commission's proposal which significantly improve it, add to it and clarify it.
I therefore voted in favour.
We are very disappointed by the rejection of the proposals we tabled aimed at improving the eligibility criteria and in particular at making it possible for aid to be granted in the event of relocation outside the EU.
This may arouse a sense of injustice among the workers that have been laid off following relocation or restructuring within the EU.
The rejection of our proposals made it clearer still that, by setting up this Fund, the EU is seeking to give workers the impression that it is committed to combating the adverse effects of globalisation, whereas in reality it is a symbolic measure that provides no solutions.
Its budget is limited and its eligibility criteria are tight.
The Commission estimates that between 35 000 and 50 000 workers could benefit from the Fund, but, by 2005 alone, the number of workers laid off as a result of restructuring had topped 570 000, most of the redundancies being due to relocations within the EU and consequently ineligible.
We therefore abstained from the final vote.
in writing. - (FR) I am hesitating over a term with which to describe Mrs Bachelot-Narquin's report on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
Demagogic?
Yes, because behind an attractive title suggesting that Brussels is going to come to the aid of the economic and social victims of untrammelled globalisation, one finds a more mundane reality: the criteria and methods of granting this fund give rise to the fear that it will not be going either to the employees or to the labour market areas that need it.
They may even encourage businesses to use bypass strategies or to look for spin-off benefits.
Redundant?
Undoubtedly, as is the European Social Fund.
Cynical?
Definitely, insofar as the Commission is pretending to help mitigate the consequences of its own internationalist economic and trade policies.
It would be less costly for it to compromise these policies for the benefit of European businesses and employees.
However, the report is not useless in everyone's view, and it is definitely very useful where Brussels' propaganda is concerned.
Article 9 of the regulation, further enhanced by Mrs Bachelot-Narquin's Amendment 38, does indeed stipulate that the Member States must make it widely known that the Commission is the one paying.
As if this money were not coming out of the Member States' budgets, that is to say, out of the pockets of the Europeans themselves!
in writing. (SV) We are strongly critical of the reasoning behind the establishment of a Globalisation Fund.
For a start, the proposal proceeds on the basis that globalisation per se is a problem.
In our view, globalisation is, on the contrary, an opportunity, especially for poor, developing countries, provided that significant economic actors, such as the EU and the USA, reform their protectionist trade policy positions at the World Trade Organisation.
The Member States of the EU are capable of implementing national measures to support those sectors that they deem to be in need of financial assistance.
A special EU fund would guarantee arbitrariness, inefficiency, bureaucracy and unjustified expenditure.
How is the Commission to decide, in a relevant way, whether globalisation has had a negative impact on a given sector?
We have voted against this report on the strength of the views set out above.
in writing. - (FR) With a maximum sum of EUR 500 million granted to it each year, this European Fund is intended to soften the blow of globalisation for employees affected by restructuring.
This is not a new form of aid for businesses, but extra assistance aimed at helping to find new jobs for employees who have been made redundant following changes in world trade.
The fund will be introduced on three conditions: there have been at least 1 000 redundancies; they have had a serious impact on employment and the local economy; and they are linked to a disruption in world trade.
The fund can therefore only be used in the event of 'major changes in the structure of world trade leading to a serious economic disruption', such as a huge rise in imports, a gradual decline in the EU's market share in a sector, or a company relocating to a third country.
I welcome the adoption of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which will enable Europeans to gain a response to their worries concerning the negative effects of globalisation and will help establish more economic and social cohesion within the European Union.
in writing. - (FR) Unlike the rapporteur, I do not believe that globalisation is an opportunity for France and Europe.
The financial profits of multinationals are one thing; the economic and social profits in terms of employment and the protection of Europe's industrial fabric are quite something else.
The creation of a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, disguised as a desire to compensate for relocations, will be just another bureaucratic and demagogic tool.
If the pro-Europeans had wanted to be more effective and straight with themselves, they should have thought instead about improving and enhancing the European Social Fund.
I, for my part, believe that only the application of preference and of national and Community protection can save our jobs by redefining fair world trade rules.
This Adjustment Fund is, moreover, unacceptable, not least because it is aimed at undermining the work of the Member States, the thinking being that efforts to promote solidarity should only be made at European Union level and no longer at national or regional level.
Economic analgesics of this kind will not ease the social suffering of our people.
The day is coming when they will ask for explanations.
in writing. - (FR) I am among those who believe that this Globalisation Adjustment Fund is totally superfluous, if not counterproductive: it is the prototype of a bad 'good idea', but once such an idea has been floated, it is difficult to stop it.
We have Structural Funds, we have the European Social Fund and other funds that operate and that are perfectly equipped to respond to the challenges and the consequences of restructuring, which is linked to relocation, which itself is arguably linked to globalisation.
