Clear definitions should prevent ambiguity in the interpretation and, consequently, should secure honest competition.
The report contains the economically sensitive subject of support which goes beyond compensation for effects which have not yet been included.
Competitive neutrality can therefore be jeopardised.
In order to establish a level playing field for the different modes of transport, and for companies, in particular, transparency is crucial in this case.
The draftsman of the opinion would have liked to have seen more weight accorded to this in the draft report, because this draft report calls for active support which goes beyond compensation.
In this connection, simply granting terminals for combined transport exemption from notification is not a reasonable measure to take.
The draft regulation may seem difficult to understand at first, but it applies honest competition as the appropriate tool for achieving sustainable transport.
More precise definitions contribute to the clarity of the Commission' s position with regard to equal conditions and transparency.
This adds the necessary predictability in the assessment of support schemes by the Commission.
After all, indeterminate support and inequality among businesses should not form barriers to sustainable transport.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, first allow me to thank my fellow member, Felipe CamisÃ³n Asensio, for his report on behalf of my Group. He has drafted it very carefully.
He did not succumb to the temptation to open the door to subsidies still wider; on the contrary, he kept it where the vice-president suggested.
The vice-president and Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio were streets ahead of the European Council. We may, nonetheless, quote the European Council.
The European Council stated in Stockholm that we need to reduce the scope of state aid in the European Union and to make the aid system more transparent.
And that is precisely the objective here.
I think that, in replacing the old Regulation No 1107/70 with the new regulation, we have indeed made the system more transparent.
As regards the use to which it is put, I believe that aid only compensates so-called unpaid costs in connection with the development and use of transport infrastructures.
This poses a problem, because it is not clear exactly what external costs are.
Let me give you an example: the theory that it is always better, for the purpose of environmental protection, to shift freight from the road to the railway does not automatically apply.
We are debating noise in the vicinity of airports, we are in the process of banning night flights.
Just think about when you hear a good old freight train in the middle of the night; it is loud, it stinks and the brakes squeal.
What I mean is that, when it comes to questions such as "What are external costs?
How can they be scientifically defined?
And how can they be apportioned?", we still have our work cut out.
I am delighted that the report says as much.
It is work which the Commission has yet to do and I am keeping my fingers crossed that the Commissioner will be able to do it soon.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my Group. He was most cooperative while drafting his report.
Basically, the rule of the internal market is that aid distorts competition and is therefore inadmissible.
The previous speaker pointed this out.
There must be special grounds for exceptions to this rule.
In this regulation, the special grounds are: the coordination of inland transport.
The prime purpose of aid in this sector is to allow fair competition between road, rail and inland waterway transport.
This is the only way of optimising the overall European transport system in the long term, especially in the freight sector.
This is the only way we shall ever bring about the much-vaunted intermodal transport chains.
In order to make these transport chains as flexible as possible, we want to extend the scope of the regulation to short sea shipping.
Government funding for building, maintaining and operating transport infrastructure does not come under the ban on aid, provided that it is available to all users on a non-discriminatory basis.
This should apply irrespective of the legal form of the infrastructure operator.
This is the only way of ensuring that railways and ports are treated on a equal footing with roads.
Now to aid for use of the infrastructure.
Aid for using transport infrastructure should reflect the widely varied costs incurred by society from the choice of mode of transport.
In other words, both the infrastructure and the external costs must be included when calculating aid.
Equality of competition between the modes of transport is safeguarded by paying the difference between the unpaid costs of two carriers to the social and more environmentally-friendly carrier in the form of aid in order to make it cheaper and more attractive to use.
Unfortunately - and this has also already been addressed - there is no politically legitimate model for calculating these costs at European level, which is why I have agreed, after a great deal of discussion and careful thought, to the supplementary model, which provides for contracts to shift transport from the roads to the railways and inland waterways.
This is introduced in proposed Amendment No 48 and I call on the House to support it.
However, this model should only be allowed for a transitional period because, the best intentions notwithstanding, it contradicts the basic approach of the regulation in targeting equality of competition.
Now to notification: aid needs to be notified, but bureaucratic costs should be kept to a minimum.
We therefore suggest exemptions for terminals which are provided for in a national or European development plan or which belong to the trans-European freight traffic network.
We are also in favour of a de minimis rule of EUR 100 000 over three years.
As far as aid for the use of transport infrastructure is concerned, we are calling for five-year aid with the possibility of renewal.
On balance, the regulation will help to bring about a clearer structure for the granting of aid for the coordination of inland transport and to dismantle distortions of competition - including between Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio, for dealing competently with such a complex subject and, on behalf of my Group, I would like to express my support for the basic line taken by the regulation.
It is precisely because we think we should push forward with and put pressure on the processes of the liberalisation of the markets and transport services that we feel that there is room for the States to retain, in a limited number of cases, their right and duty to intervene to ensure that urban development objectives are pursued and that social and environmental requirements are met.
Amongst these matters, there is no doubt that the incentive for sustainable mobility is an historic objective that must be pursued now; from this standpoint, therefore, the aid for use of infrastructure by companies, which is intended to compensate for incremental unpaid infrastructure and external costs of competing modes of transport, must also be accepted.
We are forced to this point because the forecast contained in Article 4 of the regulation is dictated solely by the absence of a general Community legislation on the definition, assessment and charging of the costs of using the infrastructure, whether they are internal or external.
This is a subject upon which Parliament has already expressed its opinion in a report which I had the honour to present on its behalf.
This is why, just until the Commission produces its proposal - and I am less sceptical on this point than Mr Jarzembowski because I hope, or rather, I am sure, that the Commission will succeed in producing measures and technical forms that will resolve many of the theoretical problems which are still being raised - I feel that the possibility laid down in Amendments Nos 26, 40 and 48 of an explicit link between State aid and objectives of the effective transfer of freight volumes towards more sustainable modes of transport must be supported.
In conclusion, I feel that the "contract" which we envisage establishing temporarily with those who genuinely undertake to uphold sustainable mobility is something which can be employed until more general rules are introduced.
Mr President, Commissioner, the regulation proposed by the Commission simplifies matters remarkably, compared with the previous rules.
Exceptions to aid rules are important, in fact they are absolutely indispensable because, first, additional assistance is needed in order to develop, operate, maintain and/or complete transport infrastructures and, secondly, freight sent by rail, internal waterway or combined transport should receive compensation for the unpaid costs of competing road transport, so that specific requirements, such as environmental friendliness and regional potential, can be incorporated into transport policy.
An approach which only aims to prevent potential distortions of competition and fails to include environmental, social or regional aspects is unacceptable.
The rapporteur, who deserves our thanks for his excellent work, and the Committee have set more far-reaching, important premises, which my group supports, such as including aid for short sea shipping, including combined transport operations at sea ports, granting aid irrespective of whether the company is a public or private company, minimising administrative costs by introducing thresholds below which no checking by or notification to the Commission is required, extending the period of aid and providing the possibility of extending the aid regulation.
Once this regulation has been implemented, there will be further opportunity to shift more traffic to more environmentally-friendly carriers.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
The numerous proposed amendments are proof of the interest which this report has generated.
An aid regulation for transport infrastructure and use is important, because it will increase transparency.
And apart from this, we may expect this directive to improve efficiency and bring about environmentally-friendly and safe transport, even if only one small step at a time.
Although no one particular type of transport is given special attention in this directive, we expect traffic on the roads to be relieved.
But this will not happen if there is false competition between the various modes of transport.
As far as I am concerned, this regulation shifts the emphasis, with the Committee making provision for various amendments which go in two directions.
First - as Mr Jarzembowski has already explained - we think it is important to provide a more accurate definition of the concept of external costs.
They cannot be interpreted differently from one country to another or from one region to another, because that really will cause distortion.
Secondly, we also assume that distortions of competition will be avoided by treating carriers identically.
If a state invests in transport infrastructure which is to be equally accessible to all users, then no distinction should be made between these carriers.
Irrespective of whether this aid is intended for the railways, the roads or an inland port, the aid must be measured against the criterion of accessibility of the infrastructure to users, so as to guarantee fair competition.
Then we also fail to see - and some proposed amendments also relate to this - why, according to this philosophy, multimodal platforms or inland ports should be burdened with a de facto notification requirement.
We expect simpler administrative procedures and, hence, equal treatment of all carriers.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and I go along with the gist of what Mr Costa said.
However, there is one point with which I, like other members of the Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy, am struggling, namely the following.
Recital No 14 and Article 4 provide for the possibility of government aid being granted for the purpose of the use of infrastructure. This is possible pursuant to the amendments.
In our opinion, this exemption from the ban of government aid is undesirable.
First of all because the starting premise is wrong, for transport by road already pays the lion' s share of external costs.
Secondly, it is not judicious to grant extra support for the use of the railways, because costs do not constitute the most important reason why transporters do not opt for rail.
We need an increase in quality and reliability, and market discipline is in that case the best incentive.
I fear that this incentive for a modal shift, of which we are, of course, in favour, is counterproductive, brings about distortion of competition and undermines the work that has been done in the framework of the rail infrastructure package.
We will therefore be voting against Recital No 14 and Article 4. They do not belong here.
Mr President, in a context marked by the rail accidents in Great Britain which serve to illustrate the price paid by society to quench the thirst for profit of rail companies, the European institutions are thinking of authorising Member States to grant aid to improve their infrastructures.
The European Union, which is ostensibly opposed to national state aid capable of distorting competition, is preparing, in the proposed report, to renege on its own proposals so as to be able to continue its policy of privatising public services.
As a result, rail companies, which pocket the receipts from the lines conceded to them without bothering to lay out the minimum expenditure to maintain and renew tracks and other rail equipment, have not only been given absolution but will be entitled to additional subsidies to meet investment obligations which should be their responsibility.
We restate our opposition to the privatisation of public services as well as to the introduction of any idea of profitability for services which are crucial to the entire population.
Management according to the law of private profit is just as catastrophic for the economy as a whole as it is for the rail industry.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, the regulation on the granting of aid for the coordination of transport by rail, road and inland waterway endeavours to do some good, to help, with a new aid scheme, to make something out of the set phrases spouted by soap-box speakers on the subject of transport, by shifting traffic, especially freight traffic, on to more environmentally-friendly modes of transport, mainly from the roads to the railways, inland waterways etc.
That is, as I say, all well and good. And the detailed work produced by our rapporteur on this proposal is also good, including what the Committee has added in a whole series of proposed amendments, including short sea shipping, including combined transport procedures, disregarding whether the carrier is a public or private company, not to mention a de minimis rule intended to keep excessive administrative costs within prescribed limits.
Regretfully, we must also point out what this regulation cannot achieve.
Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio himself has addressed this.
We still have to live with transport policy specifications from the last century, admittedly from the middle and the second half of the 20th century, but hardly forward-looking models for the 21st century.
If we really want to stem the tide of traffic on the roads in the future, we must do more than change a few aid rules for the benefit of the railways and shipping.
And if we do more, then we should do it consistently.
The Commission has just submitted a proposal to abolish - without replacing - the quantitative ceiling of 108% in the agreement on transit traffic through Austria.
Whether this is in keeping with the spirit of the CamisÃ³n Asensio report I somehow doubt.
The forthcoming discussion on this new proposal will give us an opportunity to clarify this question.
Mr President, first of all I want to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr CamisÃ³n, for his magnificent work and to Parliament for the effort it has made to improve this proposal, as shown by the various amendments presented by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and also those tabled and argued today during this sitting.
This proposal for a Regulation concerning state aid for the inland transport sector implements Article 73 of the Treaty, according to which aids for the coordination of transport are compatible with Community law.
Our intention, therefore, is to create a transparent, coherent and clear framework so that there will not be distortions in the market.
It is also important that the same standards should be applied to different inland transport modes that compete with one another.
The Commission proposal, therefore, establishes common criteria for the granting of exemptions which apply equally to all types of inland transport.
Roughly half of the amendments agree with the Commission' s position and can therefore be accepted.
Some of them, however, run in a very different direction and hence we cannot accept them.
I shall refer to some of them.
First, the concept of state aid is the cornerstone of the Union' s competition policy.
According to this concept, any public aid to a company performing an economic activity, whatever its legal status, is an example of state aid to which the rules of the Treaty apply.
Neither Amendment Nos 21 or 37 can change this fundamental principle of Community law.
The aim of several amendments is to encourage rail and combined transport through the granting of public subsidies in detriment to other transport modes.
We cannot share the approaches proposed, although we agree with the concern and need to boost the railways.
But, ladies and gentlemen, we shall achieve this if the railways are able to give good quality service and are thus competitive, and to this end I believe the measures we are setting in motion are the best.
A key element of the proposal is to create conditions of equality, so that there can be fair competition between companies based on the user-pays principal, which takes into account external and infrastructure costs.
As a consequence, state aid should confine itself to compensating for certain external costs, all within a framework of fair competition.
Uncontrolled aid in excess of these costs does not give these companies adequate incentive to improve efficiency and competitiveness.
Other amendments propose that aid to transhipment installations, with combined transport terminals, should be exempt from any notification procedure, but since the terminals are often operated by private companies and compete with other terminals to attract traffic flows, there is an obvious risk that there may be a distortion of competition.
We therefore cannot accept that they should not be communicated.
It has also been proposed that companies that provide passenger transport services may opt for aid to compensate for external and infrastructure costs.
Aid for passenger services, however, under Article 73, is regulated in the Commission regulation on public services, which proposes a complete and appropriate framework on the manner in which the public authorities can support the provision of internal passenger transport services.
Therefore the aim of these amendments is ultimately to change this regulation, and the Commission cannot therefore accept them.
One amendment also asks for criteria to be established regarding systems for compensating for external effects and infrastructure costs.
The assessment of external effects is a subject under constant debate, as Mr Jarzembowski has indicated.
Today there are methods applicable to that kind of assessment, but despite the Commission' s efforts the Member States have proved very resistant to agreeing on common formulae.
The Commission is by no means giving up the idea of submitting a proposal of this kind in the future, and I should again like to thank Mr Costa for the work he put into his own report on this.
But what we can never do is subordinate the need to assess concrete plans for public aid to an agreement by the European institutions on common standards.
On the basis of a pragmatic approach and in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, and until we have these standards accepted jointly by everyone, the Commission leaves the choice of the method for assessing these costs in each specific case to the Member States.
In view of all these arguments, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 18 (second part), 19, 20, 24, 27, 33, 36, 40, 44, 45 and 51.
We cannot accept Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 (first part), 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49 and 52.
My compliments to the interpreters on keeping up with the speaker!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Sea ports, inland ports and intermodal terminals
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0111/2001) by Mr Piecyk, on behalf of the delegation of the European Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a decision by the European Parliament and the Council [C5-0050/2001 - 1997/0358(COD)] amending Decision No 1692/96/EC as regards seaports and inland ports as well as Project No 8 in Annex III.
Mr President, I must admit, it is a wonderful feeling to be able to speak at this hour to such a large audience and it will perhaps be even more wonderful tomorrow, when a report is finally adopted, because it has been a long haul.
In 1996, at the end of the conciliation procedure, we had the Commission communication on improving ports in the trans-European networks.
Then a proposal was submitted at a very late stage and in March 1999 we had the first reading, which is when we should really have discussed the review of the TEN.
Then the Council took its time.
In October 2000, we had the second reading and it was only under the pressure of the conciliation procedure that we held a proper discussion and moved any closer to the Council' s standpoint.
It could all have been much quicker and simpler and, in the meantime, it is now 2001.
Nonetheless, I think the end is in sight.
We now have a reasonable classification of ports as international - Community - ports and regional ports, with acceptable categories for tonnage and passenger volumes.
The same applies to inland ports with a volume of 500 000 tonnes of freight, which I think is a proper order of magnitude.
We have mainly included ports and inland ports as nodes in the trans-European networks, i.e. they act as nodal points for the rest of the trans-European connections.
We have included intermodal terminals in the text, so that, as a carrier, combined transport supports the railways and inland waterways and underlines their particular importance.
After lengthy discussion, we also have a perfectly proper and reasonable definition as to what constitutes infrastructure and what can and cannot be aided in ports and inland ports.
At the same time, we have amended Project No 8, one of the major projects of the Essen Council' s 14 projects, which was later confirmed in Dublin, in close harmony in the codecision procedure, which was very difficult at the time.
I am particularly pleased that the Commission has promised to include the Elbe-LÃŒbeck Canal in its proposal at the next revision.
I am also grateful, Commissioner, to your comrades-in-arms at the Commission, who were extremely helpful in the closing stage, coming forward with one new proposal after another, so that, in the end, we did not need to go right through with the conciliation procedure and were able to reach an agreement before then.
If I may add a comment: in my view, we overestimated the TEN somewhat right from the outset.
We said both in Committee and in Parliament: let us set our sights a little lower!
These errors should not be repeated during the revision.
The Commission tabled some excellent proposals on the trans-European networks in the initial stages of the consultation and we should revert to them.
That means not just stringing and stitching together what the Member States provide you with; it also means that the Commission should set its own priorities.
As we spend so much time here talking about special dossiers, about rail and water, I hope, Commissioner, that the priority of rail and water in the TEN will be reflected in the Commission proposal.
I think that, on balance - even if it has taken a long time - we have done a good job.
I should like to thank everyone who was involved, my fellow members in Parliament, the Commission and the French Presidency of the Council for bringing it all to a successful conclusion.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to thank the rapporteur.
He has seen this difficult dossier, which involved an extremely difficult fight in the Council, through two institutions and the Conciliation Committee, and that is most important.
Rapporteurs simply need to have the courage to stand their ground.
He has demonstrated that courage and has been successful as a result.
I join him in thanking the French Presidency of the Council, which endeavoured to find a compromise at the eleventh hour.
I should like to thank the Vice-President and her officials for helping us to negotiate that compromise.
So, in this respect, my warmest thanks to the Commission.
I, too, shall endeavour to be brief on this lovely evening, hence just three points.
First: we had to set ports, inland ports, sea ports and intermodal terminals in the right context within a text on trans-European networks, which is why we said they must be ports and inland ports which are connected to the hinterland, which form part of a network, and not individual ports, which may be very nice but which have no trans-European significance.
I think that the classification which we have found together with the Council is a very good one.
Secondly, we had to draw a dividing line between infrastructure and superstructure.
To non-specialists that all sounds very complicated, but it is fundamental to the question of equality of competition between ports or to the question of inadmissible distortions of competition.
First, it was important to clarify what we mean by infrastructure.
So what must the state do and pay, without intervention on the part of the Community, without any notification requirements?
A typical question might be: does dredging a harbour mouth have to be notified or not?
This gave rise to a whole series of difficulties between the Member States and the Commission.
But what was important was to clarify that superstructure is defined by reverting to infrastructure, in order to ensure that there is no competition-distorting aid.
I think this was achieved very well.
And a third point, if I may. Madam Vice-President, please bear in mind that this is the first time that Parliament has been able to codecide on priority projects in the codecision procedure.
Because the wise Heads of State or Government said after Essen and Dublin that they would decide what priority projects are!
What is Parliament here for?
In this case, we have managed, with the rapporteur' s help, to ensure that the Council and Parliament decide jointly on priority projects and we should bear this in mind when it comes to the revision.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as on every other occasion when a long procedure comes to a successful conclusion, now too we have reason to be satisfied, especially as the conciliation procedure achieved a result for sea ports, inland shipping and intermodal terminals.
As MEPs, we should be even more satisfied because the final text incorporates most of the basic amendments made by Parliament at previous readings.
Thus, with a view to creating equal conditions - which was the whole point - for all ports in the Union, as regards eligible investments and the application of stricter criteria and requirements for classifying sea ports in the European network and supporting inland ports, the following classification terms have finally been adopted:
for international sea ports: 1.5 million tonnes of freight or 2 million passengers a year, provided that they have intermodal terminals with the rest of the network,
for Community ports: 500 000 tonnes or 100-200 000 passengers per year and
for inland ports: 500 000 tonnes of freight.
My basic belief - and this has also been catered to - is that ports which do not meet the above criteria but which are in island, outlying or remote areas should also be classified; this was a demand which we insisted on, we felt rightly, because it means that objective dimensions are covered.
We also note that the Commission needs to correct the maps attached to the text sent out as certain ports are missing, despite the fact that they meet the requirements which I have mentioned.
Finally, I should like to thank and congratulate all my fellow members who were involved in the procedure, the senior officials of the French Presidency and the Commission and, of course - and above all - our fellow member, Mr Piecyk.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, among the most important infrastructures in island regions are the ports.
If, in addition, these regions are remote, this importance becomes strategic.
We are therefore interested to see the Council proposal on the change to this decision, approved in 1996.
Since then, common positions have been reached between the initial Council proposal and the European Parliament, with the classification of seaports within the trans-European transport networks according to the criteria of annual freight traffic or passenger numbers transported.
Throughout this revision process, consensus solutions have been reached which, in the case of the outermost regions of the European Union, may paradoxically have strange consequences - as Mr Mastorakis has mentioned - because there is a risk that certain seaports situated in island capitals, at least in the case of the Canaries, will be included in a category other than that of tourist port because of the use of out-of-date freight figures or through considering domestic passenger traffic.
Therefore, every possible precaution must be taken to prevent dysfunctions in specifying the types of project that the ports can have access to as a result of this classification, which I regard as provisional until up-to-date data are available, not forgetting, of course, other possible requirements such as connection to trans-European network land routes or the installation of a number of facilities.
Nevertheless, I believe the most important thing is that these ports are included in the trans-European transport networks, with the positive consequences that will bring.
I close by congratulating the rapporteur on his work.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I should like to congratulate Mr Piecyk because, two years after the first reading of this document, today he can see the culmination of his work.
I regret that the Council is still examining at state level what intermodal terminals should be included in the European combined transport network, and I am delighted by the change to the specific Project No 8 of the Annex relating to the 'Lisbon-Valladolid motorway' , as it was formerly known, with its new name 'the Portugal/Spain multimodal link with the rest of Europe' , for the management of rail, road, sea and air connections in the three Iberian corridors between Galicia and Portugal, between Portugal and Seville/Andalusia, and between IrÃºn (in the Basque Country) and Portugal, which I hope will include the TGV high-speed train, and I also hope that financial aid will reach the so-called Basque 'Y' , which, like any other railway line, generates not only economic advantages but also great environmental benefits.
Mr President, a very good evening to you.
At this late hour we are discussing an important matter for the coasts of Europe.
It has taken several readings and a conciliation procedure, but all' s well that ends well.
First may I thank my honourable fellow member, Willy Piecyk, for his convincing work.
He has worked for our ports and for that he deserves our thanks.
I said all' s well that ends well.
Forgive me if I include in this happy ending the fact that my home port of Cuxhaven has been given a category A classification.
I must admit that I am not completely happy with the 1.5 million tonnes minimum volume required for category A classification.
What still worries me is that this will particularly disadvantage areas at the edge of the Union, which I should like to see granted the same international status as Rotterdam or Hamburg.
Mind you, I am not talking here about ports for pedalos, I am talking about ports with an annual volume in excess of 1 million tonnes of freight.
I think it is also important to see small ports in an international context.
What is the point of talking about globalisation if we then classify our ports according to the principle of "You may play the game at an international level, but you may not" ?
On the contrary, we should be pleased that we have so many nodes with international connections in the EU.
Trans-European networks and the concomitant investments only make sense if we cover Europe with a real network of ports which includes rather than excludes.
European ports have modernised considerably over recent years in order to be able to meet the demands of maritime transport and maritime technologies.
I believe in the future of our European ports in all their diversity and hope that my fellow members will support me here in the future.
Mr President, I also add my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, for his excellent work.
I am very pleased that he has actually ensured that the final piece of the TENs jigsaw has been put in its rightful place.
Particularly given the fact that most world trade is by sea, it was always a great omission that the TENs ports were never part of the TENs decision.
That is now being put right.
It is even more pleasurable because the maritime sector is probably the most environmentally sustainable part of the TENs network.
It is a pity it has taken so long.
The lesson for Parliament, the Commission and the Council on transport matters is that in future we should be doing less, but doing it better.
I hope that is the message we can endorse here tonight.
It will be a welcome boost for ports across the European Union.
In my region, for example, the port of Dover will be encouraged to switch more goods from roads to railways.
Ports such as Newhaven will be given the welcome boost that they so badly need to try and secure a role in the future.
We will all benefit from this decision but we must look to the future.
Very soon we will be faced with the proposal to revise the TENs network in its entirety.
I hope that we can ensure that those TENs revisions properly incorporate the ports, ensure that there are fewer studies, more rail projects, more maritime projects and fewer roads.
I conclude by again thanking the rapporteur.
I hope that we can now ensure that these projects are implemented across the EU and play their part in ensuring the maritime sector reaches its full potential.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Piecyk, I should first of all like to congratulate you on the revision of the decision.
In a situation such as the one before us, we can look ahead or back.
I have heard a few people make some very valid comments already.
We are talking about networks, water networks, and intermodal networks.
The environmental interests are obvious, as are the efficiency interests, but what is still lacking is some kind of driving force.
What we are now laying down in fixed numbers, which are better than what the Council is proposing, will need to be tackled differently.
If we talk about revising TEN directives, we will need to consider goods flows, shifting goods flows and the way in which, in consultation with the Member States, we can exert pressure on the investments which ought to take place.
I am therefore keen to find out what our next step will be.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first want to congratulate Mr Piecyk and all of you who have taken part in this debate, and also the Council for having concluded this conciliation, which we have all wanted to come to an end as soon as possible.
These have been three years of effort to adopt this proposal for the inclusion of nodes in the trans-European networks.
The Commission is more than satisfied to be able to say that with this modification the trans-European transport network is at last complete, and at last something essential for a genuine trans-European intermodal network has been included: the ports; the inclusion of the idea of the nodes as such means recognising the new concept of transport as a multimodal system.
At seaports and at inland ports it is decided how to get products to the citizens of Europe: by rail, by road or by inland waterway.
The nodes, well equipped with transhipment facilities, which can turn the required development of the trans-European transport network formulated in Community guidelines into a reality, will enable each transport mode to be used according to the advantages it can offer, and thus it will facilitate multimodality in practice and especially the use of alternatives to simply roads.
The incorporation of the ports into the trans-European networks is an absolutely essential factor in general, and is especially relevant to the outermost regions of the European Union.
The fact that in Madeira Porto Santo or Porto Funchal can be included, in the Azores Punta Delgada, in the Canaries Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Cristianos, Santa Cruz de la Palma, San SebastiÃ¡n de la Gomera, Las Palmas or Arrecife, in RÃ©union Pointe des Galets, in Guadeloupe Pointe-Ã -Pitre, or in Martinique Fort de France and Basse-Terre, clearly shows how important it is for these archipelagos that their ports can be incorporated once and for all as essential elements within the trans-European networks, bringing these outermost regions closer to the rest of the European Union.
In addition Annex No 3 is modified and the name is changed from Lisbon-Valladolid motorway, which was a totally reductionist definition with a single transport mode, to become the Portugal/Spain multimodal link with the rest of Europe.
I believe this formula is much better suited to the need for the Iberian Peninsula to be integrated with the rest of the continent of Europe.
The Transport Council will decide on this matter tomorrow and I hope it will be finally closed in a satisfactory manner.
Furthermore, the Commission will continue working both in the field of revising the trans-European networks and in fostering intermodal and coastal trade programmes.
I believe these advances will also be helped by our proposals to introduce more competition into seaports and more safety in the maritime sector (remember all last year' s work on the Erika I and Erika II packages), simplifying administrative procedures, and a series of other future measures aimed at facilitating coastal or maritime transport in general, as well as inland waterway transport.
Many thanks once again to the rapporteur. Congratulations!
And many thanks to all of you for your contributions, which were wholly constructive.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
You have been here for ages.
Now you are free to go and do whatever you please.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Money laundering
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0090/2001) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Common Position adopted by the Council [12469/1/2000 - C5-0678/2000 - 1999/0152(COD)] with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to welcome you this evening to the House.
We have an important item on our agenda today.
It is about fighting money laundering and there is a close connection between money laundering and international crime.
International crime - especially organised crime - is not worth the trouble if the money cannot be laundered, which is why waging an intensive war against money laundering has been the House' s concern from the outset.
I recall that, in 1995, - when I first reported to the House on this matter - we called in our report on the Commission report on the application of the first money laundering directive for the Commission to table a new proposal for a second money laundering directive, because the first one was inadequate and only set a minimum standard.
We confirmed this once again a few years later in Mr Newman' s report - at that time I was acting as shadow rapporteur for my Group.
We therefore thank the Commission for initiating this legislative procedure.
We have tried, as requested at the Tampere Summit, to complete this legislative procedure as quickly as possible.
Parliament made a huge effort, as did I in my capacity as rapporteur, to get the directive finally adopted in a single reading using the procedure provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This proved to be impossible because the Council was unable to decide on exactly what it wanted until the summer of last year.
We then concluded our first reading at the Council' s request and negotiations continued.
Unfortunately, it was impossible to reconcile Parliament' s and the Council' s positions up to the Council' s common position.
That was mainly because the discussion in the Council was being chaired not by the ministers of justice and internal affairs, but by the finance ministers, who failed to approach a whole series of fundamental questions with the required degree of sensitivity.
As a result, we have to retable 27 proposed amendments from the first reading at second reading because, to all intents and purposes, the Council has taken no notice of Parliament' s views.
It is therefore an utter mockery to state, as the Council does in its explanatory statement, that Parliament' s arguments and positions have basically been incorporated.
What are the core problems?
The core problem is not the question of banning money laundering. That was decided long ago.
All the Member States introduced legislation many, many years ago banning money laundering, be it by criminals, lawyers, bankers, whoever.
It is the reporting obligations which are at issue here.
Obviously, when we include new groups of professionals in the scope of money laundering, we sometimes encounter problems because these groups of professionals are obliged to take certain measures.
For example, lawyers have a duty of professional secrecy as regards the information entrusted to them by their clients.
This is a fundamental right of the clients, a fundamental right which is also set out in the Charter of European Fundamental Rights which was solemnly proclaimed in Nice recently.
For this reason, all I can say is that, what has been decided here by the finance ministers is far too much and goes far beyond what can be reconciled with fundamental rights.
The Committee on Fundamental Freedoms therefore had no choice but to ensure that the relevant amendments were tabled to plenary at second reading.
I would point out that the provisions of the current version of Article 6(3), which relate to an evaluation of the legal situation, have been interpreted very differently by the individual Council delegations and by the Commission and need urgent clarification.
The identification obligations contained in this directive, as it stands following the common position, are overly bureaucratic and unusable.
For example, it makes provision for complex identification obligations even in cases of little consequence and even where the lawyer and client are hundreds of miles apart.
All Parliament is concerned with is preventing money laundering and all that is needed therefore is to trigger identification obligations above a specific threshold as and when financial transactions are involved.
One last point on the question of equal treatment.
We have a situation in which the common position treats the various liberal professions completely differently, despite the fact that there are Member States in which they may sometimes work in partnership.
It is unthinkable to have to apply rule X to certain members of a firm and a stricter rule Y to other members of the same firm.
This sort of arrangement would not work and corrections are therefore needed in this area.
The European Parliament will endeavour to adopt this directive quickly.
But we expect cooperation from the Council at long last, not obstruction by finance ministers at conciliation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we know from estimates by Europol that approximately 30% of all crime can already be attributed to organised crime.
We also know that, in the meantime, organised crime has earned billions of euros in various sectors.
For example - and these too are figures from confirmed sources - human traffickers alone launder some EUR 1.1 billion from their work, namely getting illegal immigrants over the border, and some EUR 51 billion are laundered in the European Union from drug dealing in eastern Europe every year.
All this money - and this is the worrying thing - gets into legal circulation. Once it does so, it damages the legal economy and undermines our whole social system.
Organised crime does all this by using the instruments of money laundering.
New methods have been introduced, because the old ones do not work any more.
New professions are being used, or rather abused and involved in all cases.
As a result, the situation is now such that we need to create a new instrument, because we can no longer manage with the old 1991 directive.
Hence the proposal for this new directive, where the list of offences no longer refers to drug-related crime and has been extended to all forms of organised crime, taking account, of course, of all professions and branches of the economy which run the risk of becoming involved in the business of money laundering.
But, in creating this new directive, we must bear one thing in mind: the objective is to fight organised crime and the instruments which we create must be practicable, which is why I emphatically support what Mr Lehne has done in his report, because he is pursuing precisely these objectives, unlike the Council, which has left certain aspects out of consideration; at any rate, it appears to have lost sight of the practicability factor.
The Lehne proposal - as Mr Lehne himself has pointed out - is a proposal which does not affect normal citizens looking for an apartment somewhere; on the contrary, it gets to the crux of the matter: only when a transaction is completed need identification be requested.
It refers to orders of magnitude which are relevant to the money laundering business and which do not affect the man in the street when he pops into a bank somewhere.
It includes all professions which use services such as banks.
In other words, it is a practicable proposal.
I therefore hope that it will receive Parliament' s full and broad support because it will allow us to create an efficient instrument in the fight against organised crime.
Mr President, money laundering means concealing the origin of the proceeds of crime so that they can be presented as the income of a legitimate company.
Anyone who can hinder, interfere with or prevent money laundering hits organised crime - I agree here with the previous speaker - right where it hurts, i.e. in its quest for profit.
The European Community adopted a directive to fight money laundering very early on and this triggered laws in the Member States, which previously had no such legislation.
At the time, this was a good law; now it needs renovating, like any old building, because nothing is as inventive as the criminal mind.
If the directive is adopted as Mr Lehne and the Committee have drafted it, we shall have the best, most modern and strictest anti-money laundering law in the world, the implementation of which in fact only gives rise to two problems.
The first problem is a degree of uncertainty in the House as to how to deal with the special relationship between lawyers and their clients, because we are calling for a reporting obligation if money laundering is suspected.
The proposal developed by Mr Lehne and the Committee is a good proposal.
It is a simpler and more manageable proposal.
It basically runs as follows: if a lawyer is giving legal advice, then the confidential relationship between the lawyer and the client continues to be protected.
If he is somehow involved in the transfer of money - buying, investing or whatever - then he no longer enjoys this protection and has a full reporting obligation.
This both protects the confidential relationship and meets the demands of the fight against crime.
The second problem is the Council and, at present, there is no solution to it.
The Council has rejected fundamental proposals.
The reason may be - as Mr Lehne indicated - that the finance ministers are responsible and have too little experience in legislating under the codecision procedure and absolutely no experience in fighting crime.
The only way left open to Parliament is as suggested, namely to maintain the amendments proposed at first reading.
We shall have a conciliation procedure.
As Council representatives are here, I say to you: dress warmly for this conciliation.
We have no intention of allowing an excellent bill to be ruined for the sake of an amateur law in the fight against crime!
Mr President, I am afraid I am going to break the consensus so far.
The rapporteur has worked hard and I am therefore particularly sorry to say that my Liberal Group cannot unfortunately support most of his amendments.
It is time to match the rhetoric about fighting money laundering with tough action.
As someone who represents London, including the City of London, I am naturally supportive of financial services liberalisation.
However, freedom of capital movements must not be exploited for undesirable purposes.
Criminal money could give liberalisation a bad name.
This means financial firms have an interest in making the safeguards work but so do other professionals such as accountants and lawyers who are vulnerable to being used as inadvertent conduits for dirty money.
The European Parliament has itself made a strong call for the extension of a ten-year-old existing directive to cover non-financial activities and professions.
As the money laundering defences of banks have strengthened, criminals have sought new ways of hiding their money.
Therefore it is reasonable to call for other professionals to identify their clients properly and report suspicious transactions without narrowing too much the scope of the relevant activities.
We cannot therefore follow Mr Lehne in his amendments on accountants and auditors.
Turning to lawyers, they rightly get special treatment.
The obligations of the directive would only apply in respect of certain financial and company law activities.
My Group believes that the safeguards for the lawyer-client relationship, which is absolutely crucial, is adequate in the Council common position.
The lobbying of lawyers' organisations against this common position has been somewhat exaggerated.
Therefore we, in the ELDR Group, will not be supporting the Lehne amendments because we are extremely keen not to weaken the rules.
There are some of Mr Lehne's amendments which are entirely sensible and we will support them but, I am afraid, not the majority.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lehne report, which is being supported by our Group, is asking for a bold comment.
The Council does not seem to realise that the fight against money laundering practices must, first and foremost, be aimed at fighting organised crime as a matter of urgency.
National sovereignty has to be suspended in this connection.
After all, criminals do not operate with national borders in mind, and without a strong, united front, Europe does not only condone organised crime, it even encourages such practices.
The advent of the euro is also an absolute godsend for crime.
Europe is also clever enough to issue notes of EUR 500.
Money laundering becomes so much simpler because there is no longer any need to change the money into dollars.
It will soon all be possible in euros.
In the words of a journalist, Geoffrey Robinson: if organised crime were to be granted a wish from a fairy, it would wish for Europe.
Europe will witness an enormous increase in international criminal activity in the next couple of years.
Europe is only at the start of the process.
It is virgin territory waiting to be explored.
Organised crime is a multi-headed monster whose financial heart and lungs need to be ripped out.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, between the first and second readings, the Council has changed its position slightly, but not sufficiently.
If the European Parliament remains firm over the basic issue, I think that the Council will ultimately change to the extent we require.
The persistent breach of the professional secrecy of lawyers and those in similar professions is unacceptable. The authorities have no right to touch this type of secrecy.
Furthermore, the Council, which is crippled by this obsession with entering the private area of professional secrecy, is continuing to move away from what must be the fundamental basis for revising the directive, which is to prioritise the fight against international organised crime. This issue is not being paid the attention it deserves.
The professional secrecy of lawyers and those in similar professions is not a secondary issue. It is a basic question of culture and civilisation.
It is quite unacceptable under any rule of law that is worthy of the name that lawyers should be forced by the law to become informers.
It is surprising that the Council, at a time when so many fundamental rights abound, is vacillating on this issue and dares to attack one of European citizens' basic guarantees.
The new proposal is not as bad as the previous one, but it is still not good enough.
Professional secrecy is untouchable, not just in the context of trials in process but also in the context of legal consultation.
There is no question of giving any privileges to lawyers, who can and must be prosecuted if they are directly involved in criminal activities or are suspected of being so.
What cannot be allowed to happen is for lawyers to be prosecuted because of clients that hire them and much less become, in turn, the persecutors of clients who hire them.
As a matter of fact, the proposal also contains other little traps, such as the open door to Member States to extend the type of information supplied by lawyers to other areas, which makes the Council' s text particularly dangerous and perverse.
What the directive must do is to guarantee to protect professional secrecy, which is not a guarantee for lawyers but for society, for the rule of law and for Europe' s citizens.
The directive must also distinguish between what is advocacy in the true sense of the word, including legal consultation and other types of activity in which the lawyer can act but in which, materially, the activity is not one of advocacy in the true sense of the word.
In one, secrecy is inviolable, and in the other the lawyer can always be prosecuted for withholding information, like any other citizen.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the members of the liberal professions - tax accountants, lawyers and notaries - are aware of the risk which money laundering poses to the social, financial and economic stability of a country and condemn any professional colleague who wittingly takes part in his client' s criminal activities.
And yet, they are all opposed to the Council' s proposal and welcome Parliament' s proposal.
Our task, and here I mean tax accountants, and this includes me, is not to spy on our clients and, where necessary, to report them; on the contrary, our task is to advise our clients on the basis of the law and provide up-front explanations which will stop them from breaking the law.
However, we shall be stripped of this explanatory function if the Council proposal is accepted and clients have to worry that, in future, we shall report information given in confidence.
The citizens' right to confidential advice is one of the fundamental principles of the rule of law and must remain sacrosanct.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lehne's proposal for a directive is genuinely relevant and well-structured, but I would like attention to be paid to three points of the directive: the extension of the definition of alleged money laundering offences, remote identification of clients and the confidentiality of information received.
With regard to the first point, the joint document puts forward a text that defines organised crime, including in the definition of alleged money laundering offences those related to organised crime.
I fully support this extension.
However, I cannot support the further extension to other offences - fraud and corruption, at least serious - as the existence of seriousness is made clear insofar as these offences affect the financial interests of the European Union, if, therefore, they are covered by the provisions of Article 1(e) of the Second Protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests.
The reference to ascertaining the seriousness of the offence is, indeed, not very clear.
Secondly: the text proposes, once again, a procedure for the remote identification of clients, now that the provisions introducing a complex procedure which is difficult to implement have been appropriately removed from the text of the previous common position.
The new wording appears exaggerated, while the issue of standards to be related to the different practices in use should be the responsibility of the individual countries.
On this point, the concern is that specific, binding European standards might be issued, requiring the application of rigid procedures which are difficult to implement.
Thirdly: the confidentiality of information received.
All too often, the information provided on suspect operations is not treated as sufficiently confidential, which is clearly dangerous for the person who has provided it.
Therefore, stringent confidentiality rules on information on suspect operations need to be issued.
In this connection, excessive passing on of data for information purposes, for example, in banks to intermediary bodies, or in the professional categories to auditors, is eliminated.
Mr President, this is a very important report and it approaches a difficult subject.
Despite the best efforts of the rapporteur, there will still be those who will seek to get around it and to look at every way to carry on with their dirty dealings.
Baroness Ludford spoke quite rightly about the effects of this on the City of London and the legal profession.
She is a lawyer or barrister by profession and perhaps she should have declared an interest.
She will know that all of these professions and their associated professions - accountants and auditors - will look at any possibility to help their clients.
Those clients may be involved in all sorts of dodgy transactions.
They should be covered.
Only by concerted effort by all those parties concerned internationally will we be able to tackle the industry of money laundering.
I would like to tackle money lending as well, but that is another issue.
I have been seriously lobbied by the British banks about Amendment No 17, which they do not like because it tries to prevent people they do not know from paying in huge amounts of cash.
This is just the sort of thing we have to tackle if money laundering is to be challenged properly.
If it affects Internet banking, as they suggest, then there must be other ways that they can verify the credentials of people who are applying for accounts.
Money laundering is linked to organised crime.
We know that.
It is linked to drug smuggling, terrorism and forgery of bank notes.
I agree with Mrs SÃ¶rensen.
Those who are developing the euro plan to bring in a EUR 500 note - approximately GBP 300, well over ten times the face value of the largest note in common usage in Britain.
We have a GBP 50 note which is worth about EUR 80, but that is very rare.
So if I were a forger I would start out now forging EUR 500 notes and have a field day for the next few months until people come to terms with it.
There are loopholes in this system.
We must do everything we can to counter them.
Mr President, the rules of professional conduct of European Community lawyers state that it is in the very nature of a lawyer' s work to be entrusted with clients' secrets and to receive other confidential information.
If there is no guarantee of confidentiality, there can be no trust.
For this reason, professional secrecy is both a fundamental right and a fundamental duty of lawyers.
This fundamental duty, which applies, mutatis mutandis, to all members of the legal profession, is also a fundamental right of anybody in need of advice, i.e. potentially every single one of us.
We shall not stand for any further dismantling of fundamental rights, even if justified by the alleged need to combat organised crime, which is why we agree on this text with Mr Lehne and shall be voting in favour of the proposed amendments.
Mr President, this subject rightly commands a lot of attention, both in this Parliament and elsewhere.
I should like to assure Members that these proceedings attract a lot of attention in institutions outside this Parliament which are engaged in fighting money laundering.
Perhaps the money launderers themselves are also following these proceedings with a great deal of interest since it would be a happy outcome of our discussions if their life were to be made more difficult.
Apart from that, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and also the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for their sustained efforts to achieve a rapid adoption of this important but highly sensitive proposal.
The fight against money laundering, as several Members have stressed, is a top political priority and is now an integral part of the campaign against serious and organised crime.
International pressure is increasing on third countries and on offshore financial centres considered insufficiently cooperative in this area.
At the same time, the European Union, which has always been at the forefront of international efforts to fight criminal money, must continue to show the way by developing and refining its internal anti-money laundering defences.
That was the reasoning behind the clear calls from this Parliament and the Member States for a proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money laundering directive.
The Commission believes that the common position adopted unanimously last November represents a reasonable compromise on the question of the criminal activity covered - the matter of the so-called predicate offences - and also on the safeguards for the inclusion of the profession, in particular lawyers, within the scope of the directive.
In response to concerns in Parliament about cases where the lawyer is defending or representing a client in legal proceedings or helping the client to determine his legal position, I should like to stress that there is no question of any obligation to report suspicions of money laundering.
It seems to me that the fundamental human rights mentioned are protected.
They will not come into play when this proposal becomes reality.
I agree with Baroness Ludford when she says that in this respect the proposal is a good compromise between protecting fundamental rights when lawyers defend their clients in court or help the clients to determine their legal position, but not when they are participating in preparations leading up to an activity covered by this directive.
I would also like to recall that our work is the subject of considerable international attention, for example within G7 or the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF).
The international community is looking to the European Union to find solutions to those difficult questions.
I would now like to turn to the individual amendments in the draft second reading recommendation.
Amendments Nos 1 and 10 deal with predicate offences and would mark a major step back from the ambitious common position.
The decision was made to move gradually to the coverage of all serious crime.
Having agreed on this wide coverage, the Commission cannot accept these amendments.
Numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 and 22 deal essentially with the treatment of the professions.
The Commission is regrettably unable to accept the amendments as worded.
In its view, the legal profession constitutes a special case and requires special treatment.
The Commission, therefore, does not accept the principle of giving all the professions exactly the same treatment as that envisaged for the lawyers and notaries. This relates, for example, to the activities which bring the professions within the scope of this directive.
The Commission is also reluctant to envisage a Member State option to allow all the professions the possibility of reporting their suspicions to a professional body, but it firmly backs this possibility for the legal professions.
On the difficult question of advice, the Commission continues to believe that financial investment and corporate advice should fall within the scope of the directive as long as it is unrelated to current or potential legal proceedings or to the wish of the client to establish his position under the law.
Of course, the Commission concedes that drawing this line may not always be easy.
Nevertheless it also insists on this point.
I ask Members of this Parliament what they would think if a lawyer had a suspicion that his client was preparing some money laundering activity?
What would Members think if that lawyer decided not to report his suspicions, for example, to the bar association of his country?
That has nothing to do with human rights; it has everything to do with an efficient campaign against money laundering activities, which is a serious matter.
I would like Members to keep that in mind.
Amendments Nos 7 and 11 relate to the role of the competent authorities.
The Commission believes that the text of the common position is clear and satisfactory and so, cannot accept those two amendments.
Amendment No 9 would extend the definition of financial institutions to include certain market authorities.
The Commission does not believe that such an inclusion would be appropriate.
Amendment No 14 would change the coverage of non-financial activities in a way that is unacceptable to the Commission.
Amendments Nos 15 and 16 deal with client identification.
Some remarks were made earlier this evening to the effect that client identification might be unduly cumbersome and bureaucratic.
I should like to read out Article 3 of the proposal where it says that: "Member States shall ensure that the institutions and persons subject to this directive require identification of their customers by means of supporting evidence when entering into business relations".
This is not about a client ringing up for a prospectus or something like that: this is entering into business relations.
Can anyone here imagine that a bank or some other financial institution would enter into business relations without ascertaining the identity of his client?
I cannot.
If I were to enter into business relations I would want to make very certain that I knew who I was dealing with, where they lived, their nationality and so on. I cannot see at all why that is unduly bureaucratic or cumbersome.
The Commission therefore believes that the common position in this regard provides the necessary scope for flexibility.
Amendments Nos 17 and 28 - the latter of which reached us today - are concerned with identification where there is no face-to-face contact.
The Commission is afraid that Amendment No 17 would make the text too inflexible with possible negative repercussions for e-commerce.
Amendment No 28 retains the flexibility sought by the Commission, but the precise wording still poses certain problems.
Therefore the amendment, as it has now been put forward, is regrettably unacceptable.
Amendment No 18 seeks to amend the exemptions from client identification for certain insurance contracts.
In the Commission's view, a detailed technical examination of this question would be necessary before these amounts could be revised.
Amendments Nos 19 and 20 deal with identification requirements for casino customers.
The Commission considers that these amendments do not improve the common position.
In the Commission's view, Amendments Nos 21 and 24 breach the basic anti-money laundering rule that the customer about whom a report is made should not be warned.
The Commission could not accept this breach.
Amendments Nos 23 and 25 amend the provisions of the 1991 Directive on suspicious transaction reporting, which have not given rise to any problems in the past and, in the Commission's view, do not need to be changed.
Finally, Amendments Nos 26 and 27 refer to OLAF.
In deleting all reference to OLAF in the common position, the Council invited the Commission to make a separate proposal under Article 280.
The Commission is currently preparing this proposal.
The Commission considers, therefore, these amendments unnecessary.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community programmes/Judicial network
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports by Mrs KeÃler on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs:
(A5-0091/2001) on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters (COM(2000) 592 - C5-0561/2000 - 2000/0240(CNS));
(A5-0094/2001) on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a second phase of the programme of incentives and exchanges, training and cooperation for legal practitioners (GROTIUS II General and Criminal) (COM(2000) 828 - C5-0754/2000 - 2000/0339(CNS));
on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a second phase of the programme of incentives and exchanges, training and cooperation for law enforcement authorities in the Member States of the European Union (OISIN II) (COM(2000) 828 - C5-0755/2000 - 2000/0340(CNS));
on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a second phase of the programme of incentives and exchanges, training and cooperation for persons responsible for combating trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children (STOP II) (COM(2000) 828 - C5-0746/2000 - 2000/0341(CNS));
on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a programme of incentives and exchanges, training and cooperation for the prevention of crime (HIPPOCRATES) (COM(2000)786 - C5-0753/2000 - 2000/0304(CNS)).
Mr President, I shall do my best.
This report is on the proposal for a Council decision on four programmes to do with cooperation and exchange in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
To recap: GROTIUS is a programme of cooperation between legal practitioners with a budget of EUR 8.8 million.
OISIN is a programme of cooperation between law enforcement authorities with a budget of EUR 8 million.
STOP is a programme to coordinate action to combat the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children with a budget of EUR 6.5 million and HIPPOCRATES is a new programme concerned mainly with training for the prevention of crime and is to be allocated a budget of EUR 2 million.
Including HIPPOCRATES is a good idea insofar as fundamental aspects of the programme, such as its duration, access and funding rules, tally with the proposals in the other programmes.
The Commission has proposed extending the GROTIUS, OISIN and STOP multi-annual programmes by a further two years.
In principle, we should vote in favour of extending these programmes because they have proven to be conducive - even though not all the Member States take part in them - to effective cooperation in combating and preventing crime, thereby helping to implement the Tampere conclusions.
The Commission' s implementation reports confirm that the programme objectives have been achieved.
However, an external study has highlighted persistent weaknesses in the implementation of the three programmes, for example in connection with the management and dissemination of the project results.
There is also some doubt as to whether the mobilisation of project agencies has been improved by reducing the cofinancing limit from 80% to 70%.
I am in favour of including candidate countries in these programmes at the earliest possible opportunity, simply because the reform of the police and judiciary in these countries leaves a great deal to be desired. I should therefore like them involved at the earliest possible opportunity.
The only real exception which I take to the Commission proposal concerns the time scale.
I would have liked a single framework programme to have been submitted now.
I am positive that, with greater commitment on the Commission' s part, this would have been feasible.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs would have liked a more comprehensive and ambitious programme from the Commission.
There are reasons against continuing various funding programmes separately from one another.
It is difficult to allocate a project to a specific funding programme if it relates to a general subject, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, or to several technical areas at once or involves both Member States and candidate countries.
Running individual programmes in parallel increases the probability of conflicting aims and makes it difficult to carry out a financial evaluation and check the coherence of individual programmes with the general objectives of the Union.
It is also difficult for Parliament to keep track of the programmes.
The fact that most funding is for third party projects begs the question of whether the institutions have no priorities of their own which require funding.
I am thinking here, for example, of asylum seekers, of victims of crime or projects to improve infrastructure.
In addition, a separate budget has been proposed for pilot projects.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs therefore proposes that plenary support the Commission proposals but, at the same time, calls on the Commission to present a proposal well before the end of 2001, consolidating all the initiatives designed to create an area of freedom, security and justice on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union and Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, in order to strengthen citizens' rights and fundamental rights.
So much for this aspect.
Now to the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters.
It was decided to set up a judicial network in criminal matters back in 1998.
This network operates via national contact points which advise and support local authorities.
Following teething troubles of a mainly technical and linguistic nature, the network now helps considerably in simplifying cross-border investigations into criminal offences.
The Commission proposal suggests extending the method of cooperation between national contact points to civil and commercial matters, a measure long overdue in my view.
I welcome this project as an opportunity to simplify judicial cooperation between Member States and, more importantly, to facilitate cross-border legal procedures.
The activities of the network should, in the final analysis, benefit the citizens; improving judicial cooperation is merely a half-way objective, the final objective being to create an area of justice for our citizens, which is why the Committee' s proposed amendments specify that citizens should be able to take recourse to the courts and authorities in any Member State as easily as they can in their own, thereby incorporating in the proposal the objective formulated by the European Council in the Tampere milestones.
The basic objective should be to guarantee proper access to the law and fast, reliable procedures.
I also see this network as an accompanying instrument for the purpose of implementing the Brussels II Convention.
In order to learn from the experience of the judicial network in criminal matters, the new network needs to cooperate closely with the contact points of the judicial network in criminal matters.
It would also be a good idea if the secure electronic information exchange system to be set up were based on the current administrative electronic data exchange programme.
Here again, I would stress that candidate countries should be included at the earliest possible opportunity.
A central, electronic EU index of legal cases and a data bank containing a register of judgments would be invaluable to courts and persons taking recourse to the law.
A detailed proposal on this has already been submitted.
I am grateful for the amendments proposed by Mrs Wallis, which helped to clarify the text, and I am grateful for the support for my amendments in committee.
I cannot support Amendment No 8 limiting the number of participants and agree with the Commission here.
Nor was anyone able to convince me of the merit of Amendment No 13 on a pilot project within this network.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is quarter past midnight, the time when dark figures emerge from the shadows.
In Strasbourg, Brussels, throughout Europe, throughout the world, across borders, crimes will be committed tonight, people will be injured, property will be damaged.
In this respect, it is the right time to be talking about the GROTIUS programme.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs KeÃler, for her thorough preparation of the analysis of the GROTIUS programme.
I think that this programme, Mr Vitorino, is one of the main elements in a European area of freedom, security and justice.
I should like to make a point here, on behalf of my Group, of acknowledging the fact that the Commission has committed itself in this programme to what is, in fact, a relatively new area, given its original remit.
The GROTIUS programme will create islands of competence in the application of the law which we can extend one by one and gradually increase, because we can adopt as many directives, regulations and agreements as we want; if they are not applied, all our efforts are in vain.
The area of money laundering, which we have just debated, is precisely one such area in which good progress has been made in establishing the legal preconditions needed in order to fight it, including at European level.
At the end of the day, however, too little use is made of these instruments.
The GROTIUS programme will help to ensure that European law is not just law in the books, but law in action.
I can therefore say, on behalf of my Group, that we are unreservedly in favour of continuing the GROTIUS programme and I should also like to say that it is European money extremely well spent.
We welcome the basic structure of the programme because it is fully and completely in keeping with requirements regarding the application of the law.
Training measures, exchange programmes, studies, seminars, publications, are exactly what allow our legal practitioners to make use of European law and European possibilities.
However, I must also point out that the requirements of legal practice are very varied.
That is because training systems differ, the degree to which people are affected varies widely in the various regions of the European Union and, of course, the national judicial systems have very different definitions of what they expect from individual professional groups, be they judges, public prosecutors, lawyers etc. This was also the unanimous view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I am also speaking on behalf of here today.
The Committee on Legal Affairs numbers a great many legal practitioners.
Allow me to illustrate this with a very specific example.
In cities such as Frankfurt, London or Paris, training in European money laundering legislation may be crucial, while in regions on the border between Germany and France or Italy and France, it is a relatively minor problem, which is why - and this is the point which particularly concerns me - the flexibility of the GROTIUS programme is crucial to its success.
Although one measure or another perhaps meets all the requirements in one Member State, it may completely bypass them in another region, which is why we wondered during our discussions if it made sense for the Commission to set focal points for training etc. in annual programmes.
We feel that it makes more sense to create a flexible, pragmatic, practicable framework within which those who wish to receive further training in European law can determine the subject matter themselves and tailor the various measures accordingly.
We support the programme and hope that it will continue to bear fruit for legal practice in the European Union.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market specifically on the European judicial network proposal.
Today in this House we held the annual debate on the European area of freedom, security and justice.
Oddly, this theme of our citizens' access to justice in civil and commercial matters was not mentioned.
This is very strange in an internal market where we actively encourage our citizens and enterprises to travel and conduct their commerce across borders.
There is therefore a heavy responsibility on us to provide access to justice when things go wrong.
This proposal states that its aim is to create a European judicial area which will bring tangible benefits to every citizen.
I hope it will not disappoint.
It is a proposal on two levels.
First, a network of judicial authorities and personnel to ease cross-border procedures in civil and commercial matters.
But it is the second level that interests me: to give information to our citizens on how to pursue cross-border litigation.
This is difficult and not to be contemplated without competent and specialised legal advice.
Our citizens are increasingly finding themselves involved in complex cross-border problems: road traffic accidents, buying property or a timeshare, actual problems that face our citizens.
Whilst we move towards extrajudicial remedies, we must also ensure that judicial remedies are accessible.
That is why my Group will support the amendment that was supported by the Legal Affairs Committee to secure a pilot programme of access to specialised legal advice.
This should be central to this network - a network of judicial personnel is one thing, but a network that really provides cross-border access to justice would be the best way to recognise progress towards a real area of justice in Europe for our citizens, and this on the day of the annual debate on that subject.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, with this initiative we are extending the experience we have gained through the Judicial Network in criminal matters to the civil and commercial spheres.
First and foremost, we have focused on the importance of cooperation and exchanges of information between the Member States' judicial authorities, with a view to creating an area of freedom, security and justice.
The report by Mrs KeÃler, whom I wish to congratulate for the quality of her work, warrants our support, particularly because it makes judicious suggestions, specifically on cooperation between this new network and the already existing network in criminal matters, on the participation of countries that have applied for membership of the Union and on the desirable and necessary transparency in the way the network operates.
Above all, however, the report warrants our support because of its suggestion for improving information for the general public.
It is worth bearing in mind that the ultimate aim is to ensure that European citizens can seek justice in the courts and authorities of any Member State as easily as they can in their own country.
In order to achieve this objective, a public information system must also be in place which can inform Europe' s citizens of their rights.
I believe that there is a lack of information and clarification in this area and this is another reason for welcoming the new competences granted to Commissioner Vitorino as the person responsible for generating improved communication and information strategies within the Commission.
I hope that the qualities he has always demonstrated will enable improvements, which we can all see are urgent and much needed, to be brought to this thorny and delicate subject.
Lastly, I wish to say a few words about the programmes that are also under discussion. With regard to their importance, we all agree with the rapporteur' s suggestion that it makes sense to finance the various programmes under one framework programme: dispersion does not bring advantages, and I think that, in this way, we would be able to make gains in terms of synergies and clarity.
I should also like to hear Commissioner Vitorino' s opinion on this matter.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first and foremost like to congratulate Mrs KeÃler on her two reports.
I would like to quote a few excerpts from a recent interview which was published recently in a Dutch magazine.
International organised crime is more successful, more powerful and more dangerous than ever.
The judiciary is meanwhile losing virtually all of its grip on major, transnational crime across the world.
Whilst drugs dealers, human traffickers and arms dealers enjoy the full benefits of globalisation, the judiciary remains hopelessly caught behind its own national boundaries.
This will be the golden era for international crime.
Today' s international crime syndicates are global business corporations.
They are applying the principles of what global business corporations should do, as taught at the Harvard School of Business: think international, form joint ventures and forge strategic alliances.
The European Union, Europe, will become one huge Disneyland for organised crime.
It is, therefore, crucial that a European judicial network is set up promptly.
Not only for criminal affairs, but just as much for civil and trade affairs.
It is both urgent and necessary for Europe, especially in terms of judicial matters, to organise itself professionally.
We should, in this respect, perhaps follow the lead given by organised crime.
Our Group supports both reports submitted by Mrs KeÃler.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the chairman and members of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the rapporteur, Mrs KeÃler, for their support for the Commission proposals as well as for the information they have given on the strategy to reorganise the programmes, which was nevertheless clear from the explanatory statement of the proposals the Commission itself presented.
The Commission' s intention is to pursue the action of the existing programmes for two years and to launch Hippocrates at the same time and for the same period. Essentially, the aim is not to interrupt sources of financing and to avoid any discontinuity in its action which would only serve to weaken the projects and the objectives that have been set.
The de facto situation is that these programmes came to an end in 2000.
It is imperative that they be renewed as quickly as possible.
As to the new Hippocrates programme for the prevention of criminality, which is one of the most important aspects of the fight against crime, it takes its name from the celebrated Greek physician, for whom prevention was better than cure, and is based on the experience gained by the Commission in other programmes under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
Bringing the legal base and the ways of managing the new Hippocrates programme into line with the other programmes will, I am sure, simplify the management and utilisation of financing programmes which are now running smoothly after five years of experience on the ground.
In Mrs KeÃler' s draft report, the merger of the different programmes is clearly indicated within a timeframe which, in fact, coincides with that put forward by the Commission.
This method will, moreover, enable the Commission to rationalise the management of the programmes and to integrate them into a general framework which corresponds to the area of freedom, security and justice called for by the Treaties, by the Vienna action plan and by the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.
The Commission' s objective is to integrate all the programmes into a coherent block. This may lead to the presentation of framework programmes under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union and Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and of another in the context of asylum and immigration which, in my opinion, merits a different type of treatment to the other objectives.
This strategy to merge the programmes will, I am sure, strengthen the effectiveness of management and transparency and will help to better inform the European Parliament about what will follow.
The Commission is therefore absolutely on the same wavelength as the European Parliament and I can only welcome this. But our main concern, naturally, is to prepare this coordination in the correct manner.
That is why the Commission will pursue the debate which is already under way and will make the most of the time available to it to extract the essential elements.
We will present our proposals for consolidating the programmes along the lines indicated in Mrs KeÃler' s report by the end of 2001.
We are counting on constructive dialogue with, and the support of, the European Parliament to make this operation a success.
I would now like to turn to the Commission proposal for a Council decision establishing a European judicial network in civil and commercial matters.
As you are aware, Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union states that the aim of the European Union is to maintain and develop an area of freedom, security and justice.
The Vienna action plan and the conclusions of the Tampere Summit recognised that citizens could only enjoy freedom in an area of justice in which they could gain access to the courts and to the authorities of all Member States as easily as in their own countries.
In an amendment you propose, quite rightly, spelling this out in the text of the decision we are debating today.
The Vienna action plan and the Tampere Summit were very precise as regards the domain we are dealing with. They called upon us to study the possibility of extending the principle of a judicial network to the civil domain and to establish an information system which citizens could access easily and which would be supported by a network of national authorities.
It is therefore in this context, which was sketched out by the Treaty on European Union, the Vienna action plan and the Tampere Summit, that the proposal for a decision we are debating today is enshrined.
Above all, we are seeking tangible benefits for all our citizens. We want them to be able to turn to the courts of any Member State just as easily as they can to those in their own country, so that individuals and companies alike can exercise their rights.
And we want to achieve this by putting in place a bipartite mechanism, to both parts of which, I hasten to add, we attach the same importance.
The first part is about establishing a flexible, non-bureaucratic structure which will ease the flow of judicial cooperation between Member States. This is already the case in the criminal domain, from our experience with which we have learned a great deal.
The second part, which is just as important, is about going beyond what is currently being done in the criminal domain and putting in place a system to provide all citizens with easily comprehensible and accessible information which will help them to overcome their reluctance to defend their rights in a Member State other than their own and will thus ease their access to justice in this Member State.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs KeÃler, as well as the draftspersons of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mrs Wallis and Mrs Wenzel-Perillo, for the support they have given to our initiative.
As regards the proposals for amendments contained in the legislative proposal, first of all I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9.
I would like to point out however that, in connection with Amendment No 3, we do not see an obstacle to future instruments being able to provide specific cooperation mechanisms.
Concerning Amendment No 9, on the other hand, it is fitting to allow a certain margin of flexibility in its operation.
As regards Amendment No 4, the Commission has its doubts.
However, this does not mean that the Commission rejects the idea of developing databases in the field of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters.
On the contrary, we would like to be able to develop such databases in this field provided, for example, they can be of significant assistance for monitoring the implementation of adopted or future instruments.
We also believe the network may be very useful for this purpose.
That is why, although we are unable to accept the amendment as it stands, in response to the wishes expressed by Parliament, I would like to clearly point out in the recitals that the network may collaborate in the development of specific, precisely targeted projects in this field, for which priorities will be duly established in the light of the immediate actions of the civil judicial network.
Another amendment that the Commission cannot accept as it stands but whose essence will be written into the text of the decision is Amendment No 7.
The Commission would, in fact, like the network to be able to use the services offered by the IDA programme as far as possible.
The Commission is also able to accept part of Amendments Nos 10 and 11 and stresses that the prescribed 3-year period will start once the network is actually up and running.
Nonetheless, I have to admit that the presentation of annual statistical reports seems to us to be an excessive burden on the network.
However, the Commission is unable to accept Amendment No 8 and has its doubts about Amendment No 6 concerning collaboration with the judicial network in criminal matters.
We will do everything within our power to ensure that this collaboration is put into practice.
Nonetheless, given the differing legal basis and pillar between civil judicial cooperation and criminal judicial cooperation, it does not seem appropriate to incorporate into the text what, in any case, will be done in practice.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through this proposal we hope to put in place an effective instrument which will enable us to achieve our ultimate goal: to bring about a European area of freedom, security and justice in civil and commercial matters. This is something which affects not only the will and the everyday lives of our citizens but also the proper functioning of the single market.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Support system for producers of arable crops
In accordance with the agenda, there now follows the debate of Mrs Auroi' s report (A5-0117/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, concerning the proposal for a Council regulation on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops.
Mr President, Commissioner, to ensure that the first harvest can be gathered after 15 August 2001, against the difficult background of the BSE crisis and as a matter of urgency, the Commission has been prompted to propose amendments to the Council Regulation establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops.
This proposal is one of the measures in the seven-point plan being submitted to Parliament by the Commission which would enable certain land which is currently set aside to be put back into cultivation for crops such as clover.
This decision to amend the Regulation as a matter of urgency will be seen by producers as a sign of hope.
Europe is not abandoning them and does not want them to carry the can for a situation of which they are very often the victims.
Aside from its urgency, this measure follows on directly from the White Paper on food safety which included in its proposals the incorporation of problems associated with the production of animal feed.
The proposal also addresses the problem of the production of vegetable protein needed to ensure suitable feedingstuffs for bovine animals.
There is a deficit in such production in Europe as a result, inter alia, of the Blair House agreements.
The set-aside arrangements laid down resulted in arable land lying fallow while, at the same time, livestock were being fed on animal protein, including some from animal meal.
In order to enable all livestock to be once again fed with more wholesome feedingstuffs, and in order to overcome the BSE crisis, it is essential that the set-aside arrangements be amended so as to encourage production of fodder crops.
Your proposal, Commissioner, admittedly constitutes a step in the right direction, although the change proposed is only marginal in relation to the Regulation as a whole.
The change is of simply symbolic value but we in this House could go further and use it as the trigger for a debate leading to the eventual reform of Agenda 2000.
The aim of the measures proposed is to move, initially, from set aside towards arrangements which are designed to increase crop rotation, but only in the organic farming sector.
The effect of such arrangements would be to enhance the use of certain set-aside land by the planting of crops such as broad beans, kidney beans, lentils, chick peas, lupin, vetch, alfalfa, fenugreek, sweet clover, clover, white clover, field beans, peas and others.
This would have a positive effect in terms of promoting a more natural approach to livestock rearing because it would be associated with the production of fodder.
In addition, it would have a positive impact on the environment, since we now know that set aside is often harmful to the environment.
Rather than encouraging mass production of protein and oleaginous crops and promoting rotation through payments linked to area or to volumes, this adjustment to the rules will allow the partial lifting of the set-aside requirement in order to grow fodder legumes not for human consumption.
It represents a step in the direction of reform of the CAP along the lines of high-quality livestock farming and extensive production which we would all like to see.
The question is whether this should be limited to boosting organic farming on the basis of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 or whether it is possible to go further.
In the latter case, conventional farm holdings should be allowed to benefit from the same possibilities if they are willing to restrict themselves to planting only fodder crops on their set-aside land.
The obligation to complement the growing of cereals with legumes and fodder crops in order to receive subsidies can thus contribute towards establishing ecological cycles and improving the soil.
Such a commitment, associated with good farming practice, would permit the restoration of good rotation of crops, such as is found in organic farming.
However, if we confine ourselves to lifting the set-aside requirement only for organic farming, we shall be making no more than cosmetic changes.
The Commission made this proposal too restrictive by limiting set-aside production to organic farming, not through any admiration for organic farmers, but because it did not want to chip away at the WTO agreements by adopting a measure which would favour all EU producers.
In fact, however, depending on the state of the crisis in health safety, under the WTO agreements, an amendment of the rules by Member States does not constitute a violation of its agreements, which the Economic and Social Committee also pointed out.
Furthermore, if the health of consumers and the survival of farmers are at stake, it will be necessary to have the courage to review these agreements.
George W. Bush had no qualms when he rejected the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
The crucial thing now is to take a quick initial decision to enable farmers to sow their crops as soon as possible.
The best solution would have been to allow conventional farmers to sow set-aside land with protein crops before 15 August 2001, but the Commission did not accept this.
Commissioner, a compromise has been put to you by the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for 2001 which, in addition to organic farming, concerns all agricultural holdings which take part in an agri-environment programme.
Then, from 2002, this measure could be opened up to the conventional sector.
This isolated proposal should be but a first step towards a more complete reform of the common agricultural policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the present proposal for the amendment of the Regulation establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops, the Commission is pursuing the aim of encouraging environmental agriculture by means of the cultivation of fodder legumes on land set aside.
This, however, is only to be possible for holdings which, with their production, are taking part in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 and which, in effect, are organic holdings.
This is where our criticism begins, and for the most part the Council also sees it the same way.
I want to emphasise this at this point.
We are calling for not only organic holdings to be permitted to cultivate legumes on land set aside, but, against the background of BSE and foot-and-mouth, all livestock holdings.
In this way, the many livestock holdings could receive a small compensation for the sometimes truly dramatic financial losses caused by BSE and foot-and-mouth.
At least, however, in addition to the organic holdings, holdings should be considered which are participating in the agri-environment programmes, that is to say holdings which, within the framework of Regulation 1257/99, are participating in national environment programmes approved by the committee.
The argument put forward by the committee in this connection, that the instrument of set aside would be given up with our amendments, is surely incomprehensible.
It is clear to every farmer affected by BSE and foot-and-mouth and who is participating in these support measures that the EU is giving no new cause for celebration here.
Rather, he will be grateful for it as a very clever interpretation of the little room to manoeuvre which remains to us in the present miserable situation for livestock holdings.
Secondly, the committee itself reports that the desired restoration of the soil' s fertility will be achieved by the cultivation of fodder legumes.
It is incomprehensible why only organically farmed holdings should profit from this recycling.
After the animal meal fodder ban, it just makes sense to encourage the cultivation of highly protein-rich legumes.
We will need far more of them than we are at present producing.
The introduction of soya may pay off.
If, however, we are taking sustainable agriculture seriously, we must take a step forwards here.
Mr President, compared with a draft Regulation which is extremely minimalist, the virtue of the report by Mrs Auroi is that it opens up the way to start, albeit very modestly, to reduce our enormous deficit in protein and oleaginous plants.
Whilst the majority of agricultural holdings are mixed, the Commission proposes to limit the possibility to grow fodder crops on their set-aside land, in other words, on less than 10% of the surface area designated for cereals, protein and oleaginous crops, to holdings which are 100% organic, which accounts for barely 2% of the cultivated area in the European Union.
Mrs Auroi is proposing extending this possibility to conventional farm holdings, especially to livestock farms, and she is right.
But even if it is revised in this way, the proposal is clearly not in line with the extent of the problem we have to solve.
Our deficit in protein and oleaginous crops, which was made considerably worse by the Blair House constraints, exceeded 35 million tonnes before the ban on animal meal for monogastric animals even came into force.
At least 300 000 tons of additional imports a month must be added to that.
So only an ambitious 'protein' plan will redress the balance and satisfy consumers' demands for traceability.
In this regard, I am appalled at the Commission' s spirit of renunciation, which it demonstrated in its communication of 16 March, in which short-term free trade took the place of policy.
I will come back to this in tomorrow' s debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you, Mrs Auroi.
Equally, I would like to thank the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the rapid and thorough examination of the proposal on the use of land set aside for organic holdings, which I had already submitted in the plenary part-session within the framework of the seven-point plan.
I would like to express clearly, though, that the proposed measure is not aimed at replacing the animal meal at present banned in fodder.
Tomorrow morning we will have the opportunity to discuss this aspect.
Our aim - the aim of the Commission - is quite a different one, namely to create an additional encouragement of environmental agriculture, since organic farmers are dependent on the cultivation of fodder legumes like clover and lucerne to a greater degree than conventional agriculture.
I am therefore of the opinion that the possibility proposed by the committee will be of great use to organic farmers.
We should also not forget, however, that there are good reasons for the restriction to organic holdings.
Firstly, it should be guaranteed that the land set aside remains an effective instrument for the control of production, in order to keep our aquaculture subsidies in the Blue Box.
Secondly, a certain preference for organic holdings is therefore appropriate here, since otherwise it would be much harder for these to be able to fulfil their production conditions.
It would be advisable to bear these arguments in mind when the relationship between supply and demand in protein-rich crops is discussed tomorrow.
That is why I must reject the amendments which are aimed at a use of land set aside for the cultivation of all types of fodder legumes and protein-rich crops and for an extension to other types of agricultural holdings besides organic holdings: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are aimed at the relationship between supply and demand in protein-rich crops.
This question was examined and settled by my services, after the Council had engaged the Commission to do so in December and within the framework of the Nice Summit.
Tomorrow morning, I will make a statement about this here in plenary.
For this reason, I would prefer not to discuss this further today.
In conclusion, one final obvious comment on the proposal discussed today: only if the Council can decide quickly will the organic farmers be able to profit from the opportunity offered, since our proposal would already also take into account the set-aside period from 15 January 2001 and apply from then on.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Now, the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has asked for a brief word.
Mr Chairman, you have the floor.
Mr President, I wanted to refer to Rule 122.
It concerns personal statements. It states that these personal statements may be made, if, in the course of the debate, remarks were made about one' s person.
What I now find fault with is that absolutely no remarks were made about my person. Perhaps I may then, nevertheless, make a personal remark.
Namely, I would have liked to have heard if anyone had said that what the committee has here proposed and what we have gone on to examine more thoroughly and make more detailed proposals about fills the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture with great satisfaction.
No one has said that we - and I in particular - have now been occupied with this work for years, that we are very happy that Commissioner Fischler has now made this proposal and that - even if we do not adopt all the proposals - we are nevertheless embarking upon this use of land set aside and upon the environmental revaluation of crop rotation.
I wanted to say that as a personal remark.
Many thanks, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity.
Even in his new capacity as chairman, the honourable Member has not forgotten which tricks can be used in order to still have the chance to speak.
But what you said was interesting Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I thank all of you who have held out for so long, particularly the members of the Commission and its officials!
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Address by Mr Rau, President of the Federal Republic of Germany
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to offer my sincere thanks, Madam President, for your invitation and the opportunity to present my thoughts on the future configuration of Europe to this esteemed House.
Europe is becoming an increasingly concrete, increasingly tangible concept to its citizens, because it directly affects them.
In 271 days, the citizens of twelve European countries will have a single currency in their wallets.
We can travel freely through Europe, from Nordkap to Gibraltar.
But do we perceive ourselves as Europeans?
To my mind, it is, as a major European journalist, the Italian Luigi Barzini, once said: "...despite our incontestable diversity and differences, basically all men are built in the same mould..."
We have a rich stock of common traditions, to which Winston Churchill referred in his famous Zurich speech in September 1946.
For him, the common European heritage consisted of the Christian faith and Christian ethics, culture, art, philosophy and science, from antiquity to modern times.
We have all seen quite specific examples of our common interests in Europe.
Surely globalisation is forcing us, as Europeans, to realise that we must not let the diversity of our cultural wealth become the plaything of, or fall victim to, worldwide dumbing down by global media powers, that the challenge to our values by fundamentalists and ethnic cleansing in Europe calls for a common response on our part and that the market should not have free reign but should be harnessed for social and ecological purposes?
Today, we can see just how great an appeal the European Union has in numerous countries.
There are clearly perfectly practical reasons for this and the European Union is, without doubt, becoming more and more useful to all its Member States.
But it is much more than a merely functional community.
Europe stands for a specific concept of human existence and human coexistence.
That is what we are constantly striving for, to strike a balance between the freedom of the individual and his responsibility towards society and the community.
Even the greatest visionaries of the 50s could never have imagined the exact configuration of European unification or just how many areas it would encompass.
The successes of the common market should encourage us to set ourselves new objectives.
However, if we are to be perfectly honest, we must admit that, alongside a broad consensus among many of our citizens, there is also scepticism, mistrust or even total rejection of the European unification project.
I think it is important not to allow doubt and criticism to target individual measures and their impact.
Most of us know how important it is to live in peace after centuries of enmity, how well we have pulled together to increase our prosperity, how many advantages the internal market offers our companies, how much better we can work together in Europe on research and that progress means being able to establish in another European country without any great difficulty or having more and more educational qualifications recognised throughout Europe.
What the people of Europe worry about is how the unfathomable unification process is organised and the minimal influence which they appear to have on it.
Many of our citizens rightly ask who is driving the European unification train?
What speed limit must it keep to?
What traffic regulations apply to it?
How and where are the points set?
What coaches are being coupled to or removed from it?
And where does the journey end?
These are not academic questions.
They are the questions being asked by the sovereign power, i.e. the people, in every country in Europe.
And there can be no doubt that all these questions must be decided by the sovereign power in each of our European democracies, i.e. by the people and only the people.
Now I sometimes hear it said that a democratic process in the traditional sense is no longer possible in Europe because there is no single European nation.
It is true that there is no European nation and no European public in the same way as there is in the individual Member States of the European Union.
But that should not prevent us from strengthening the principles of democracy at European level.
Democracy, rightly understood, means quite simply that people who want to act together for a specific purpose create the rules and procedures needed in order to do so.
This is in no way contradicted by the fact that, in all other cases, these people have quite different interests and want to be sure that these differences are safeguarded.
That is precisely what Europe is doing.
We want to pursue certain common objectives and interests, while preserving the variety of European countries and nations which form the basis of the European Union and make it so special.
And this will, and should not, change in the future.
So the question we need to answer is: how can we organise the European Union so that its citizens can make more sense of it?
What must we do so that decisions taken by the European Union are more broadly justified at European level?
At the end of the day, what should the organisational framework look like?
And I am firmly convinced that the only answer is: we need a European constitution.
(Applause)
A European constitution must become the cornerstone, not the keystone.
A European constitution should stipulate that Europe will not turn into a centralistic superstate and that we are building a "federation of nation states".
I am well aware of the fact that the terms "constitution" and "federation" appear highly suspect to many people in Europe.
But surely this is just a semantic argument?
I am positive that we shall find it easier to agree on what we mean in substance than on the definitions.
We need to discuss the content instead of wrangling over definitions.
(Applause)
A European constitution must be the outcome of a broad debate in every country.
Sceptical and critical voices will be raised in the debate.
There are many weighty objections which I take seriously, even though I personally take a different view.
I should like to discuss some of these today and explain my vision of a European constitution and the road leading to it.
One frequent argument against a constitution is that every additional step in the unification process is yet another step towards a European "superstate" and towards the abolition of the nation states.
But anyone who, like me, is in favour of a federation of nation states, wants exactly the opposite!
If we want a European Union which is a federation of nation states, it is because it improves the democratic credentials of community action, while guaranteeing the nation states the powers which they want to and should retain.
New powers can only then be transferred to Europe if all members of the federation so agree under a transparent and democratically controlled procedure.
Preserving what has been acquired, preventing what is undesirable and remaining receptive to what is new - that is the basis for a constitution for a federation of nation states and that is what I should like to talk about.
No one wants to sideline the nation states and their sovereignty - on the contrary: we shall need them - and all their differences - to guarantee the diversity of Europe for a long time to come.
The implicit or explicit response to the idea of a federation of nation states is that Europe will, in fact, be predicated on the model of the Federal Republic of Germany.
But if you take a closer look, you will see that the idea of a federation is justified for quite different reasons.
The state structures in our European countries have evolved historically; in other words, they are different but equally valid democratic responses to specific historical developments.
And it is precisely because Europe is not moving and should not move towards a centralised state that we need to find an arrangement which reflects this will, which safeguards our various traditions and which, at the same time, is up-to-date.
A federation meets all these requirements.
(DE) The point of a federation is that each Member State has sovereign powers to decide on its type of constitution and state structure.
Just as I am loath to let Europe decide on internal arrangements for the Federal Republic of Germany, I am equally loath to dictate how others should organise their own country.
The last thing I want is to impose a federal solution on, say, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Hellenic Republic or the Kingdom of Spain or, one day, the Republic of Hungary, which is not wanted.
It is precisely because we do not want a centralised state that we need a constitution.
What is the function of a constitution in a political community?
A "grammar of freedom" and, especially for us in Europe - a "grammar of solidarity".
In it the sovereign power, i.e. the people, set out the values to which they are committed, the areas in which they delegate their powers, and to whom, and how they wish to organise and limit these powers.
Finally, a constitution regulates who is responsible for what.
The principles of a constitution for a European federation of nation states are the same.
It should consist of three sections.
The first section should contain the Charter of Fundamental Rights proclaimed at the Nice Summit.
(Applause)
It should govern action taken by the European institutions and be binding on the Member States as regards the implementation of European law.
This will not affect the Member States' catalogue of fundamental rights or the European Human Rights Convention.
The second part of a European constitution must set a clear dividing line between the powers of the Member States and the powers of the European Union, thereby defining the fundamental relationship between the Member States and the federation.
In so doing, an effort should be made to give the principle of subsidiarity a broader base.
Only matters which are not better dealt with in the Member States should be decided at European level.
That must be the guideline.
In other words, everything not specifically allocated to Europe should remain the responsibility of the nation states.
In order to counter the fear of creeping centralisation in Europe, I think we should also consider expressly stipulating the powers reserved for the Member States.
I should just like to mention two examples here.
The Member States must be able, even within the framework of a European social policy, to decide on their own old-age pension arrangements or to promote renewable sources of energy within the framework of an environmental policy.
(Applause)
Of course, I know that even the most perfect definition of powers will not spare us conflict in the future.
I agree with Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker and numerous other Europeans that we should not stipulate what the EU will never be allowed to do.
The constitution must allow for powers to be regulated differently by unanimous decision of the members of the federation.
In addition to including the Charter of Fundamental Rights and regulating powers, the constitution should comprise a third section on the future institutional structure of Europe.
I spoke at the beginning of the uneasiness of many of our citizens, who experience or feel that they have too little influence on how quickly, in which direction and towards what destination the European unification train is travelling.
They see their democratic rights violated, which is why the question of Europe' s democratic credentials must take centre stage in this debate.
(Applause)
Parliament and the Council of Ministers should - in my view - be developed into a proper two-chamber parliament.
(Loud applause)
The Council of Ministers should become a chamber of state, in which each country votes and is represented by its government.
This chamber would safeguard the sovereignty of the nation states.
The European Parliament - you, honourable Members - should become the citizens' chamber.
Both chambers should have equal decision-making powers in all legislative areas.
(Loud applause)
A great deal of criticism about Europe sticks to the Commission, and often rightly so.
But often the Commission is used as a scapegoat and the hunt for scapegoats is everyone' s favourite pastime!
(Laughter, applause)
I recognise the tendency of almost all national governments to brand decisions which they themselves have taken at European level as the monstrous invention of European regulatory mania ...
(Loud applause) ... when they come up against opposition in their own country, as I am sure you are aware.
However, that does nothing to mitigate justified criticism that, given its importance, the Commission lacks democratic credentials for its work and we must change this.
As you know, there are two models for this: either the people directly elect the Commission president or the Commission president is elected by the two chambers of Parliament.
(Loud applause)
I prefer the parliamentary model, whereby the Commission can count on a parliamentary majority.
(Loud applause)
But irrespective of which route is taken towards a constitution, a stronger parliament with two chambers and a Commission with better democratic credentials can give new, decisive momentum to the European idea.
The citizens of Europe will be more interested in what is going on in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg, they will identify more closely with it, even if they disagree with certain decisions.
A stronger parliament would, I am sure, also help the parties to be European parties in fact and not just in name.
(Applause)
The reform of the European institutions would also help to bring about broader publicity at European level, which we sorely need.
There are already issues which concern people all over Europe.
Just think of the euro, its internal stability and its external value.
Just think of peace in our corner of the world, the desire for healthy food or the rules governing transfers of football players within Europe.
We must ensure during the constitutional debate that the Commission continues to represent the Community' s interests.
(Applause)
This mainstay of the European unification process, the Commission' s right of initiative, must stay.
(Applause)
Debates over recent months have shown that the intergovernmental method has reached the end of its useful life.
(Loud applause)
And we are still only a Europe of the Fifteen!
We all know that politics are a question not just of the right objectives but of how they can best be achieved.
So how should the route towards a European constitution be constructed, what shape should the "process for the future of Europe", as it is so aptly called, take?
The debate on the future of Europe should be broader than the debate held in a classic type of Intergovernmental Conference.
(Applause)
When the convention to prepare the European Charter of Fundamental Rights was set up in 1999, there were a lot of sceptics.
As I am sure you agree, rarely has a European committee worked as well as this convention in recent years.
(Applause)
I think it was exemplary.
We should therefore discuss the future of Europe in a broadly composed committee in which government representatives, members of national parliaments and, of course, the European Parliament, all play an important role.
(Applause)
This is where the decisions needed should be prepared as comprehensively as possible.
We should be extremely careful and make every effort to ensure that the debate on the future of Europe is not just held in expert circles.
We must involve all interested citizens.
I agree with my Italian colleague, President Ciampi, and many other people that we must also involve the citizens of the candidate countries in this debate.
(Applause)
The future European constitution will also be their future order.
Ladies and gentlemen, exercise your rights as freely elected members of Parliament.
Make use of the opportunity which you have to take Europe forward.
You have more influence than many would have you believe.
Help to make Europe real for the citizens of our countries.
You have already done so much.
Keep up the good work.
I am with you all the way!
(Long, loud standing ovation)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
The President wishes to communicate that the Bureau has a comment. The Spanish version of the Folias resolution on granting discharge for the other institutions has not been corrected, as was requested during voting time.
The services will therefore now correct the text of paragraph 19 of the resolution to bring it into line with the original Greek text.
(The Minutes were approved)
Animal feedingstuffs/Vegetable proteins
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0079/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC [13292/1/2000 - C5-0002/2001 - 2000/0015(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf) and
Commission statement on incentives for vegetable protein production.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, this is a lesson in political evolution.
An open declaration - I do not need to go into the details - means in the eyes of Parliament that the contents of the declaration must be laid out clearly and unambiguously on the table, so to speak.
In 1979 it was turned into a disguised declaration and, since that time, the argument has run and run.
It is running in Member States and has long been running here in Parliament and in the Commission.
Right up to the time the Commission presented its proposal, the Commission services tried to make it clear to us that this was an open declaration. This assessment was finally reaffirmed in its own proposal.
Parliament then approved this fine proposal after making a few improvements, calling for a positive list for example.
Then it went to the Council, where a bit of wheeling and dealing went on, which resulted in a half-open declaration.
That was only to be expected from the Council.
What disappointed us was the fact that the Commission adapted its proposal, which was reasonable and urgently called for an open declaration, to suit the Council.
In the meantime, I had been in contact with all the associations which were involved in this area: the cooperatives, especially the Association of the Compound Feedingstuffs Industry and the Rural Credit Association of Germany.
All of them tried their hardest to explain that this open declaration would not in fact be permissible or implementable.
This continued in the Council when the associations were unsuccessful in Parliament.
The Council and, as has already been said, the Commission reacted to this.
Now we have a situation where we have a disguised half-open declaration.
Interestingly, the then Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany worked on this.
He did not, however, issue a protocol stating that he, in fact, wanted the open declaration.
When the BSE crisis hit, this Minister wrote to me saying that, as rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should make sure the open declaration was implemented with no ifs or buts.
And that was the very Minister who had been in favour of the half-open declaration.
A real lesson in political culture.
Now we are faced with a different situation in Member States, especially in Germany, and once again we have a wave of excitement over BSE.
Now, all those who before had their foot on the brakes are coming and telling us to implement the open declaration.
This is now our task.
My suggestion is that we stick with the original Commission proposal and our amendments.
We, in this Parliament, will implement the open declaration.
We will enter into negotiations with the Council and, if necessary, we will frustrate them in Parliament and put the blame on the Council if political groups do not get what they want.
Commissioners - those of you who are involved in this - I guess you will just have to get used to the fact that this Parliament will endorse my recommendation.
I hope we have you on our side and that, in your role as mediator, which you have to assume, you will support our position in the negotiations which must get under way with the Council, as we are now at the codecision procedure stage.
We are on the right track.
We want the open declaration with no ifs or buts and we also want the positive list.
Mr Byrne, in our proposal for an amendment, we are giving the Commission a goal to aim for.
Not immediately, we know this is not possible, but by the end of the year, we want at least a Commission proposal which will signal to us what direction it could go in.
You see, we are prepared to make compromises here too.
Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to go into what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just said as David Byrne will make a statement on this at the end of the debate.
I would like to clarify the issue of so-called protein deficits.
On 4 December last year, the Commission was invited by the Agriculture Council to analyse the situation of the market for protein-rich plants and to draw the appropriate conclusions from this analysis.
At the time the invitation was extended, it was made clear that all Commission proposals had to move within the framework of the financial forecast agreed in Berlin.
A few days later, the European Council in Nice defined the Commission obligation more precisely and called for a detailed analysis of supply and demand for oleaginous and protein crops to be carried out under strict compliance with the financial parameters agreed in Berlin.
The Commission was happy to accept this invitation. It made a detailed investigation of the issues that had been raised and summarised its findings in a working document and in a Council communication to Parliament.
What were these findings?
In 2000, approximately 3 million tonnes of animal meal were produced in the European Union. Some 2 million tonnes were exported to third countries and a further half a million tonnes were used in the production of pet food.
The remaining 2 million tonnes or so were used as pig swill and poultry feed.
With the Council Decision of 4 December last year, the use of such feedingstuffs and such animal protein was banned for all agricultural livestock.
As you know, until then they had only been banned for ruminants.
The key issue here is to determine whether replacing the shortfall in animal meal by vegetable crops is a problem and, if not, how this should best be brought about.
To be able to assess the changed demand for feedingstuffs we must first take a look at the development of meat consumption and meat production.
The analysis contained in the working document is based on the assumption that the per-capita consumption of beef in the wake of the BSE crisis of 1996 will start to recover in the coming three to five years.
This should mean an increase in both the consumption and production of pork and poultry meat.
There are also two factors which determine the demand for feedingstuffs in pig and poultry production, firstly, the lack of animal meal and, secondly, the expected rise in production.
To replace animal meal in feedingstuffs for pigs and poultry, primary consideration will be given to soya meal, then rapeseed and sunflower meal, peas, beans and sweet lupins. Cereals are also taken into account even though the protein content of cereals is relatively low.
In practice the composition of feedingstuffs will be determined by the price and availability of raw materials and technical constraints.
The combined effect of all these variables is difficult to predict and it is even more difficult to isolate the changes brought about by the ban from normal market adjustments or the consequences of political measures.
The current price ratio between cereals and soya will trigger three main reactions in the feedingstuffs industry and among farmers.
Firstly, as prices for oilseed meal are relatively high in comparison with cereals, the proportion of protein-rich feedingstuff ingredients will be reduced to the physiologically requisite minimum.
As a result, in comparison with previous years, especially 1998 and 1999 when soya prices were extremely low, the total quantity of raw protein in animal feed has fallen.
Secondly, the proportion of cereals in animal feed should increase.
Cereals are admittedly suppliers of energy rather than protein, but with an average protein content of 10% to 12%, the 5 million extra tonnes of cereals which will be fed to animals this year will supply half a million tonnes of raw protein.
Thirdly, the remaining gaps will be filled by additional imports of soya meal.
In view of the slight drop in the total quantity used and the additional quantity resulting from cereals, there is expected to be a soya requirement in the order of one to one and a half million tonnes.
What options have we examined to close these expected gaps?
Firstly, we have looked into the possibility of increasing the aid quotient to EUR 74 per tonne, rather then keeping it at the same level as cereals, namely at a level of EUR 63 per tonne, as was decided in Agenda 2000.
The disadvantage of this option is that it would re-introduce crop-specific aid for oilseeds and production would be subject to the upper ceiling set out in the Blair House agreement.
Furthermore, if this option were chosen, around EUR 1 270 per tonne of soya meal equivalent more would have to be spent on additional subsidies, which is 6 times more in additional subsidies than soya currently costs.
The budget costs for this option would amount to some EUR 475 million a year.
The second option we have examined is to increase the aid quotient for peas, beans and sweet lupins by EUR 6.
We opted for EUR 6 because such an increase would be covered by the peace clause in the WTO.
Simulations have shown that, with the current price ratio between protein crops and cereals, this increase would only lead to a very small increase in cultivated areas. This would lead to extra expenditure, which would be higher than the price of any additionally imported soya, since the entire crop has to be paid for out of this increased subsidy.
Thirdly, we have assessed the consequences the planting of protein-rich crops would have on set-aside land.
If crops are sown on set-aside land which are then in competition on the market with cereals and oilseeds, this would result in the blue-box eligibility of land premiums in cereal production being called into question, quite apart from the fact that such a step would trigger severe international criticism.
Finally, we have examined the possibility of increasing the guaranteed maximum quantity for green meal and dried feedingstuffs together with a reduction in per-tonne guaranteed aid.
As you all know, dried feedingstuffs are primarily used for ruminants and not for pigs and poultry, and our problem is primarily the keeping of pigs and poultry.
Furthermore, it is doubtful whether increasing the guaranteed maximum quantity by 10% would in fact lead to an increase in produced quantities, if we already have an estimated dried feedingstuffs surplus of 12% in the 2000/2001 financial year.
The increase in guaranteed maximum quantities would most likely be used to cover existing surpluses.
Against this backdrop, from an economic standpoint, there are no convincing reasons for introducing new support measures for protein production or for extending the scope of existing support measures.
The availability of soya meal on the world market is not a problem. Quite the opposite, the extra quantities needed will increase current imports by just 3% to 5%.
The expansion of soya production in South America and the USA will bring more soya meal onto the market than the European Union can use.
What is more, the current budgetary plan does not allow for any leeway to implement the options we have assessed.
Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, regarding protein deficits Commissioner Fischler mentioned a few options which are available in the European Union.
But, Commissioner, I think, and I am sure you know, that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted to give a clear signal with the Auroi report that promoting the planting of protein crops on set-aside lands would be given more support.
I am convinced that Parliament will take this line.
Back, however, to the first issue.
The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Herr Graefe zu Baringdorf, said that how the production of mixed feedingstuffs had evolved over the years had been an eye-opener.
How different positions have been put forward at different times here in Parliament has also been an eye-opener.
The path has not always been smooth, it has had its rough edges and there has been a lot of to-ing and fro-ing.
I think, however, we are now on the right path towards showing even greater transparency and not only promoting it but implementing it as well.
There have been hostilities and demands from industry against which Parliament and representatives in Parliament, with a clear majority, have always stood their ground.
From the outset, Parliament has followed a clear line for more transparency.
Cards are being shuffled in the production of compound feedingstuffs and wherever cards are shuffled we need to be especially careful about whether we are actually dealing with a game of cards or the production of feedingstuffs.
We have been careful to implement transparency more visibly than in the past, which is only right and proper.
You are smiling, Commissioner Fischler.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf talked about a half-open declaration, which has been something special in recent years.
I would like to say that it would have been more correct not to talk of a disguised but a half-disguised declaration.
That may have brought about more movement in the direction we now want to go in.
Transparency and the positive list are necessary and would be a further improvement to the Commission proposal.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take an example from another area of the food industry, and that is the purity regulations for beer.
The purity regulations were introduced and became law in Bavaria in 1516, which was right and proper.
A positive list was introduced then and a positive list should be introduced now.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, in its common position, the Council did not adopt a complete and open statement but simply a meagre compromise which merely calls for a declaration according to brackets of percentages by weight.
This does not tally with the notion of comprehensive transparency in the production of feedingstuffs, which we have called for on numerous occasions.
Farmers do not yet know what and how many primary products are contained in feedingstuffs.
That is why the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the recommendation of the rapporteur, who systematically integrated the open declaration of feed materials in the text of the draft directive.
He also repeated the demand for a legally binding positive list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs.
The Commission has been requested to put forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2001.
This too has our full support.
Surely it cannot be so very difficult to draw up a list of permissible feed materials for feedingstuffs.
At least we know what the various feedingstuffs should as a rule contain, or perhaps, after what has been said, we do not.
The eight months proposed by the rapporteur seem to me to be a reasonable and adequate time within which to draw up such a list.
This list is urgent, since we cannot do without industrially produced feedingstuffs in the future.
Just like people, animals need balanced nutrition.
If they are only fed water, hay and cereals, which was called for in the past, this would not satisfy current conditions for agricultural production and is, in my opinion, a far cry from reality.
Given that feedingstuffs are the most important part of meat production we must ensure that these feedingstuffs are safe.
How else can we restore consumer confidence in meat.
All in all, the Council would be well advised to accept Parliament' s proposals without amending them and to demonstrate that it has learnt from past mistakes.
We cannot wait until it is too late and then tinker about with the symptoms.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the general debate I often hear that it was the farmers who fed their cows other, dead cows.
It was unfortunate that they did that but, at that time and with the system we have in place, farmers were in no position to know exactly what they were giving their animals.
Now that we are discussing the food and feedingstuffs chain, we must ensure that the whole chain, from A to Z, is imbued with a number of concepts - transparency, information and public access to documents.
We have inherited a chain with many links and with large gaps between each link and the next.
