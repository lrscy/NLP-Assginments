I am deeply convinced that it will not be only our two institutions that will benefit from the new agreement: the Union as such will benefit from increased cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
Europe needs a strong European Parliament exercising its powers.
Europe equally needs a strong, independent and credible Commission, and through your vote tomorrow you will mark an important step in this direction.
Â Â  . Mr Barroso, congratulations on your previous speech and on having put things straight and put certain people in their place.
I believe that Mr Leinen and VicePresident WallstrÃ¶m have laid out the characteristics of this fourth Framework Agreement, and I am not therefore going to deal with the specific issues that they have explained so well.
But please allow me to express a political consideration on behalf of my group.
The history of this Parliament is the history of an assembly that wants more power, a consultative assembly, a Parliament elected by universal suffrage, then a Parliament with certain competences in the field of the internal market, a Parliament with codecision powers pursuant to the Maastricht Treaty and, since then, a Parliament which has been playing an increasingly significant role in legislation and political control, and that is extremely important.
And I believe that, in compliance with the Treaties, this fourth Framework Agreement serves to move us forward in this direction.
I would like to say that, while moving in that direction, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always believed the Commission to be at the heart of the system, to be the most innovative element of the institutional architecture and that it is therefore also the most decisive element of that architecture.
In the debates currently taking place, when we are asked why the European Parliament does not enjoy legislative initiative, we say âbecause it is the job of the Commission to define the Community interest, because it is the job of the Commission to ensure compliance with the Treatiesâ.
I am therefore sure that this Framework Agreement is in line with the new European Constitution, which will provide more democracy, more efficiency and more transparency, and that it will achieve those objectives in that same way.
And when we approve this Agreement tomorrow â and we will approve it tomorrow with the votes of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â I would urge the European Commission to respond to the need to produce initiatives in Europe and to present them; if it does so, when it carries out its duties, it will always have the support of the Group that it is my honour to represent today.
Thank you very much, congratulations on this work and please go ahead.
It is now time to get to work.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ten months after the Commission entered office, we must be pleased by this result, even though I would imagine, Commissioner, that from the point of view of the method, being yourself so to speak the champion for transparency within the Commission, you must not be fully satisfied with the conditions under which this agreement was negotiated and you must think that there are further improvements to be made next time.
With regard to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, this agreement concerns us in three respects.
First of all, conflicts of interest: we are waiting for it to be fully implemented with, I hope, complete transparency.
Then there is comitology and, on this matter, I thank you for your comments.
In the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, implementation of the Lamfalussy process is acceptable only if it operates in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement that we drew up during the previous Parliamentary term, which makes it possible to take full account of the position of the European Parliament to the same extent as the deliberations of the Council.
My final point relates to the implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy and the way in which this Parliament is involved in the adoption of âemploymentâ guidelines and broad economic and monetary policy guidelines.
We support the idea that national parliaments must be involved upstream and must take ownership of this process, of this strategy, but this must not be to the detriment of the conditions under which the European Parliamentâs position is defined.
On this matter, as you know, we have a problem with the timing and I am counting on your cooperation and support so that this Parliament can be in a position to adopt its contribution to these broad guidelines under favourable conditions.
Â Â  . Mr President, my Group fully supports the framework agreement and the amendment by Mrs BerÃšs.
The framework agreement is a distinct improvement on the one we signed with the Prodi Commission in 2000.
It strengthens the political accountability of the Commission to Parliament, especially through the commitment of President Barroso that we see in clauseÂ 3 with respect to a loss of parliamentary confidence in an individual Commissioner.
With this revised framework agreement, the Commission itself becomes much more parliamentary in character than it has been in the past.
Parliament shows itself to become far more capable and responsible for scrutinising and sustaining critically a strong executive authority.
The comprehensive agreement establishes the ground rules for what promises to become a strong working relationship between us.
The framework agreement certainly changes the context of CommissionParliament relations from that of the previous debate on the fatuous motion of censure.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am obliged to the rapporteur.
My group will be voting in favour of this fourth framework agreement, which it sees as strengthening dialogue and reinforcing the legitimacy of both institutions.
This applies to the substance of the agreement rather than to its methodology, concerning which I should like to make a number of critical comments.
There is something special about interinstitutional agreements between constitutional institutions, and, in their totality â there are now several hundred of them â they take on something like a constitutional character.
Agreements of such a kind can hardly be entered into by secretariesgeneral without reference to the relevant committees, without a political mandate and without the agreements being published.
I believe, Mr President, that not least the group leaderships should give consideration to a change of method, and, since we want to give added force to the requirement for transparency among ourselves, we should also require the same transparency of the process whereby interinstitutional agreements come into being.
I also have a demand â or it might be a request â to make of the Commission.
Neither on our own nor on the Commissionâs website is it at all possible to call up the interinstitutional agreements currently in force, for they are not published, and so none of them can be accessed or consulted.
This amounts to a serious lack of transparency, and I would ask you in strong terms to make all the existing interinstitutional agreements public.
Â Â  Mr President, today in this House we have an illustration of the deficiency in the current procedures, with a motion of censure being necessary to try to extract information sufficient to meet suspicions about potential conflicts of interest.
It was met, of course, with a predictable grovelling response by the majority in this House.
Yet this report itself accepts those same deficient procedures.
The report tries to make much of ArticleÂ 2 of the Framework Agreement, but the flaw therein is that while it bestows on the Commission President the obligation to identify and act upon conflicts of interests affecting Commissioners, nothing is put in place to identify and act upon such conflicts affecting the President himself.
Thus the same situation which gave rise to todayâs debate continues to exist unaddressed by this report.
What is obviously needed is a wholly independent Commissioner for standards in public life.
As my second point, I take this opportunity to distance myself from the ritual obeisance to the Constitution that appears in recitalÂ A. Alas, this besotted committee feels it cannot speak without showing cringing deference to the illfated Constitution, ever peddling the lie that it will deepen democracy, when in reality it is assetstripping every nation state of more democracy and more power.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there can be no doubt that both Parliament and the Commission are in need of the new Framework Agreement between them.
I fully subscribe to the view set out in the Decision implementing the Agreement, namely that the deepening of democracy in the European Union calls for close relations between Parliament and the Commission and for more effective parliamentary scrutiny of the work of the executive, in other words, of the Commission.
I was delighted to see that this Decision includes a reference to the European Constitution in its second citation, even though the Constitution is not yet a binding document.
What is more, the Agreementâs final provisions include a revision clause that provides for the Agreement to be amended after the Constitution has entered into force.
This is proof that both Parliament and the Commission are not only aware of the importance and significance of the European Constitution, but also realise that it needs to be put into practice as quickly as possible.
The second issue I should like to address relates to the status of Commission experts and expert groups.
ArticleÂ 16 of the Agreement sets out fundamental principles relating to these expert groups, such as the need for transparency with regard to their membership and activities, and the need to update lists of names and make these lists public.
This is a step in the right direction.
I hope that these provisions will have some bearing on transparency in the EU, and that they will in fact ensure that the EU becomes more transparent.
I also hope that they will prevent conflicts of interest and overhasty accusations of corruption.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank Members for all their speeches, the majority of which were in support of this framework agreement.
I just have two very short comments to make.
I should like to say to Mr Allister that this agreement is based on the existing Treaties.
We are not anticipating the Constitution.
Secondly, on publicity and publicising the results, they are all published in the Official Journal and are available on the Internet.
If there are any indications to the contrary, we will follow them up.
But the general rule is that we always make them available in the Official Journal and on the Internet.
We will, of course, also publish them on the Commissionâs website.
I hope for a positive vote tomorrow.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  â The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m (Î60135/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EURussia relations (2004/2170(INI)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m, on this very comprehensive report covering all aspects of relations between the European Union and Russia.
It goes without saying that these relations have a particularly important place in the European Unionâs external relations, a place that has become even more important since the enlargement of the EU.
It is also true that this report was, to a large extent, drafted prior to the summit.
We will therefore have to examine how the analysis and facts set out in this report will need to be supplemented in the light of the conclusions and discussions that took place at the 15th EURussia summit in Moscow on 10Â May.
It was at that summit that the European Union and Russia reached agreement on the terms of a strategic partnership enabling us to improve cooperation in the four Common Spaces: the economic space and the spaces of freedom, security and justice, of external security and, finally, of research, education and culture.
Of course, the negotiations on the four road maps specifically identifying cooperation in these four spaces encountered some difficulties, given that their aim was to reorganise all of our relations by adopting hundreds of operational points that now need to be implemented.
We can, however, congratulate ourselves on the result achieved.
By agreeing, in Moscow, on an overall package including road maps for the four spaces, Russia and the European Union have succeeded in reaching a new stage in relations between them, namely the implementation of a true strategic partnership as decided upon in MayÂ 2003 at the Saint Petersburg summit.
This is an undeniable success which has not been significantly tarnished by the Russiansâ reference to certain difficulties connected with the transit of goods to Kaliningrad.
In the opinion of President Putin, the agreement on the four spaces should make it possible, in his words, âto build a greater Europeâ.
I think that is an objective that we can share, provided that this greater Europe is based on values to which we ourselves subscribe.
With regard to the Economic Space, during the summit, Russia renewed its agreement, given in 2004, to the gradual abolition of payments for Siberian overflight rights, which are no longer justified.
Negotiations on the exact procedure for this phasing out should be concluded shortly, and its entry into force should not be delayed.
Russia expressed its wish for greater cooperation in the energy sector, which moves in the direction of our own interests.
It is presenting itself as a reliable partner for the European Union in this sector, as in others, and it has committed itself to implementing the Kyoto Protocol, even if it is threatening at the same time to withdraw if the system is not reformed by 2012.
These discussions show that the subject of global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, and particularly what will follow the Kyoto Protocol, is vitally important and we must therefore pursue this line of dialogue with the Russians.
Russiaâs membership of the WTO is also a prospect that must be developed rapidly, as it is once again a matter of fully integrating Russia into the multilateral system by making it subject, in this way, to international disciplines, particularly to disciplines in terms of trade.
With regard to the space of freedom, security and justice, one of the most important points in this space is certainly the free movement of persons.
Despite the lack of specific results on this point at the summit, the European Union still views it as extremely important to reach a speedy conclusion to negotiations with the Russians with a view to signing an agreement relaxing, on the basis of strict reciprocity, the conditions for issuing shortstay visas, and also a readmission agreement.
This latter point is vital for the EU and there can be no relaxation in the visa requirements without a parallel readmission agreement.
We know that the Russians are reporting difficulties in this respect, but they are no longer rejecting or ruling out the conclusion of such an agreement, which they are now linking to the conclusion of similar agreements with their own neighbours.
This is therefore a matter that must be developed continuously and a subject on which dialogue with the Russians must be actively pursued.
I am also pleased that, on 18Â May, the Russians signed the agreement fixing the border with Estonia.
We are, unfortunately, still waiting for an analogous agreement to be signed with Latvia and we must encourage the Russians to sign such an agreement.
With regard to the space of external security, we agreed with the Russians during the summit that closer cooperation should make it possible to work together to reach a peaceful conclusion to what are known as âfrozenâ conflicts affecting our common neighbourhood or, rather, to use the wording that was finally used in the conclusions, âthe regions adjacent to Russia and the European Unionâ.
In this context, I am thinking, amongst other things, of the Transnistrian conflict in the Republic of Moldova.
Adoption of the wording âadjacent regionsâ enabled us to overcome the initial reservations that Russia expressed on this subject and I think that both the European Union and Russia have much to gain from our cooperation in this region of the world where any developments have direct repercussions for Russia and the EU.
It is also stipulated in the joint road map that all cooperation processes must be based on the sovereign decisions of States and the text clearly recognises and I think that this is one of the most important points that the European Union and Russia share the same common values.
It is therefore those common values, including respect for sovereign rights, and also respect for human rights and for the principles of the rule of law, that must guide the development of our relations with Russia.
Let me take this opportunity to say a word about our common interests concerning the fight against terrorism: the fight against terrorism must be based on these values and on respect for the rule of law.
The space of research, education and culture is an important space where the people of Russia and Europe can meet and forge closer links, because we have a common cultural and historical heritage.
In this important space, we need to develop a number of initiatives.
One in particular has already been decided: a European institute in Moscow is to be opened in 2006.
By way of conclusion, I would like to stress the importance of all our relations with Russia.
With this great country, which also holds the key to the stability of our continent, we need to build a longterm trusting relationship based, I would stress again, on democratic principles, on just those values that must characterise the construction of this greater Europe that we want just as much as they seem to.
In so doing, we cannot ignore the fact that we must also engage in a tough but constructive dialogue on issues of human rights, on issues to do with the freedom of the press, and on other humanitarian issues arising in particular in regions such as Chechnya.
This dialogue has been launched, particularly on human rights.
It must be pursued actively as an integral part of our relations with Russia, because it is in the interests of the European Union to have a reliable partner in Russia, to have a partner that contributes to the stability of our continent and that also shares the fundamental values that we are trying to defend on this continent.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ PresidentinOffice of the Council.
Since the EU was enlarged just over a year ago, our powerful neighbour in the east, Russia, has become more and more important to us.
The country has been a strategic partner for a long time, and we share many challenges and tasks that require cooperation and common solutions.
Trade, the environment, energy and the fight against terrorism and organised crime are just a few of the areas concerned.
We need good relations in order to be able to achieve stability, security and prosperity throughout the European continent.
Our partnership has not, however, been without its problems, and it is pleasing that, at the summit on 10Â May, we succeeded in agreeing upon cooperation within the Four Common Spaces.
The relevant summary included approximately 400 practical â although not especially practical â points requiring cooperation, but these are still far from being resolved.
It is important and gratifying that this much progress has been made, but it also remains to be seen what lies beyond the rhetoric.
The PresidentinOffice of the Council, MrÂ Juncker, said that the EU and Russia had still not embarked upon their honeymoon but that there was true love between the two.
It now remains to be seen what this means for their future marriage plans.
We are dependent upon each other, but relations have been strained and cooperation made more difficult by internal developments in Russia that have seen a decline in human rights and democracy under Putin.
Ever more power has been concentrated in the Kremlin and in Putin personally.
Political parties have been marginalised, and there have been restrictions upon freedom of expression and the free media.
There is still extensive corruption, and there seems to be no end to the atrocities in the bloody conflict in Chechnya.
The murder of Maskhadov, Chechnyaâs elected president, will not make a political solution any easier.
Putin and the EU also have different views of developments in the neighbouring countries.
The situation in our common neighbourhood has in many ways been gratifying.
In Ukraine and Georgia, people have turned away from authoritarian regimes and instead chosen democracy, openness and renewal.
This is an area in which we must together realise that we have everything to gain from democratic neighbouring countries, and Russia and Putin must accept that these countries do not belong to the Russian sphere of interest.
The people of those countries want democracy and see the EU, and not Russia, as a model for the future.
The problems in terms of cooperation are not, however, only due to Russia.
Relations have been made more difficult by the fact that the EU and the individual Member States send out different signals.
The common policy places very strong emphasis upon values such as democracy and human rights but, when individual Heads of Government meet Putin, the common values tend to end up very far down on the agenda.
Instead, there is a focus on, for example, energy. This does not give a helpful picture of the EU and creates confusion on the Russian side.
In the report we are discussing, the Committee on Foreign Affairs is critical of some aspects of the way in which Russiaâs domestic politics have developed and thinks that the EU must be clear.
The conflict in Chechnya can only be resolved politically.
The EU must offer to act as a mediator and, as time goes on, also participate in the work of construction.
Terrible atrocities are taking place against civilians in Chechnya.
This concerns us all.
There is no internal conflict.
No one denies the terrible acts committed in Russia â I am thinking, for example, of the massacre in Beslan â but these do not justify the atrocities in Chechnya and the unwillingness to put the soldiers responsible on trial.
Because of its size and geographical position and because it is our neighbour, Russia is an incredibly important partner.
There is no alternative to active cooperation, but we need to focus on a number of practical areas of cooperation in which the EU and Russia both benefit from results.
Quality, and not quantity, should be the determining factor behind this work, and the issues relating to democracy must never cease to be integrated.
The EU must convince Russia that economic development and trade go hand in hand with modernisation, a functioning legal system and democratic reforms.
We support Russiaâs ambitions to join the WTO, together with the reforms that this will entail.
We look forward both to greater cooperation in the environmental sphere in connection, for example, with maritime safety and with safety in relation to nuclear energy, and we look forward to a continuation of the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
We hope that, together, we shall find a solution to the conflict in Transnistria and that the Russian troops will be withdrawn from Moldova and Georgia.
Naturally, we must mainly look forwards, but we have a common, and at times dramatic and bloody, history.
In order to move forwards, we need to be able to put the past behind us, but, in order to do that, a process of reconciliation is required.
The archives in Europe and Russia from the Second World War must be opened up, and Russia must recognise its occupation of the Baltic states and the atrocities committed by the Soviet Union.
It is excellent that the border agreement with Estonia has been signed.
A similar agreement now remains to be signed with Latvia too.
We have a limited ability to influence developments.
That is why it is incredibly important never to retreat from those values on which EU cooperation is based and to make it clear to our large neighbour that we shall not do so.
The EU and Russia will only ever be able to achieve a true partnership if it is based on the defence of democracy.
The Russian people is not helped by our remaining silent on important issues of principle.
A coherent strategy with a common message, instead of oneman shows by individual leaders, is the only way of conducting a credible policy towards Russia.
Â Â  .
Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m for the very useful report.
Its timing is highly opportune, coming just after the successful EURussia summit that President Barroso, Commissioner Mandelson and I attended in Moscow, together with the Council presidency.
As we now begin implementing what has been agreed, it is very important to say that Russia is a strategic partner, but at the same time we also have to speak with one voice and we have to address all the questions â both the more difficult and the less difficult questions â which I can assure you we did.
Many of the issues in your report are highly relevant to the discussions we had in Moscow.
Let me give you a very short overview from my side.
Of course, I can only complement what the presidency very eloquently said.
The major achievement was adopting the four roadmaps for the four âcommon spacesâ that we have been negotiating for many months.
The last summit meeting in November was more difficult and we were far from coming to an agreement, whereas through the many individual negotiations that we conducted we finally achieved our result in the four areas: the economy; freedom, security and justice; external security; and research and culture.
They will now provide a good basis for significantly enhancing and strengthening our relations with Russia in the coming years, which is necessary.
We have the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, but this alone is no longer an adequate basis.
We had to enhance it by these four common spaces.
More importantly, we confirmed that the EURussia relationship is based on common values â and I am glad that President Putin himself mentioned that â including respect for human rights and democracy, the rule of law, and a free market economy.
These values must now also guide us as we turn to implementation.
President Putin, in a speech he gave in the Duma, very clearly mentioned that, and we are encouraged by this as also by the human rights dialogue that we had with Russia, which was a very frank and open dialogue where all these questions were raised and discussed.
In the economic sphere, I very much welcome your emphasis on our common interest in seeing Russia become a real partner with an open, dynamic, intensified economy and also â this is equally important â a transparent judicial system.
This will be at the forefront as Russia comes closer to WTO membership and, as you said, we all support that because we think this is the direction that has to be taken and which will start to create a real common economic space.
At the summit we also made clear that phasing out noncommercial payments for Siberian overflights is essential for our economic cooperation.
We also ensured that energy cooperation and the Kyoto Protocol are very high on the list of priorities in our roadmap.
I can confirm to you that, as requested in your resolution, the Commission will continue to provide financial support for Russiaâs implementation of Kyoto and for nuclear safety.
In the field of freedom, security and justice, we agreed that we must rapidly conclude negotiations on both, on the one hand on readmission and on the other hand on visa facilitation.
I believe that the agreement on both issues is within reach and we should aim to conclude it as soon as possible.
Our aim would be the next summit in October.
I know this is a very ambitious aim but I say as soon as possible.
The Commission and the Member States remain convinced â we said so clearly and it was part of our difficult negotiations until the very end â that the simultaneous implementation of the two agreements is essential.
We also raised, as did President Barroso, the issue of human rights and the dialogue with Russia on the Northern Caucasus.
Following the April factfinding mission by DG Relex, we are now exploring ways and means of providing financial support, especially for socioeconomic recovery, in addition to our considerable humanitarian assistance.
We have to create a new climate there and we also want to do a lot on the question of technical support.
We want to bring people out of the Northern Caucasus, out of Chechnya, so that they can also see a different environment.
This is also very important for a future process designed to lead to reconciliation and to better social and economic conditions.
Of course all this should lead to free and fair elections.
This should be the aim.
We would also like to improve administrative and institutional structures.
We have to continue our dialogue with the Russian authorities on this point.
We also agreed that human rights and international obligations must be respected as part of fighting terrorism in an effective and very resolute way.
Turning to external security, we agreed with the Russian authorities that we both want an integrated Europe without new dividing lines.
Even if the four common spaces include the notion of adjacent regions, President Putin himself acknowledged that it is a common neighbourhood and we have to work within the common neighbourhood to make it a better, more stable neighbourhood for both of us.
That means that we want to cooperate on the question of stability and prosperity in neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia, without forcing them to choose one camp.
They should proceed with their internal reforms and find solutions for their very difficult problems.
Finally, let me underline the importance of our agreement on research, education and culture.
Those areas, even if they do not seem to be highlighted, are specific areas for peopletopeople contacts.
We want to promote more exchanges with regard to university studies and also want to work on different cultural projects with Russia.
Your resolution rightly draws attention to the fact, as I said at the beginning, that Russia is an important strategic partner for us, and all the more so since enlargement.
This has highlighted the need to further develop cooperation with Russia in the northwestern regions, especially in the âNorthern Dimensionâ.
I must also agree with your suggestion that the Unionâs policy on Russia has too often suffered from a lack of coherence.
I said Member States must stick to the common line and we appealed very often to them to do so during our negotiations.
Since in the end everybody stuck to this line, we managed to come to an agreement.
I hope the success of our summit will enable us to strengthen relations on a now broadly agreed basis and in a coherent manner.
We will be able substantially to deepen our cooperation across a wide range of sectors, and we must use all the possibilities offered by the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
I can assure Parliament that the Commission will take full account of all the points made in its resolution and I remain as always at your disposal for further discussions.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I think that MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m has, by dint of a great deal of effort, made a very good job of drafting this report, which makes clear not only the significance of our relations with Russia, but also the fact that Russia is not merely a partner in Europe and an anchor of stability, but has also, as a result of enlargement, become our neighbour, and that it is for that reason that we must, both today and in the future, devote particular attention to our relations with it.
Russia, though, is not a candidate country; this is not a progress report in which we sit in judgment, saying, âthat is wrong and that is wrong and there you need to do moreâ.
In this instance, we are applying a quite different procedure.
While drawing attention to violations of human rights or developments in democracy that we regard as undesirable, we should refrain from itemising what is going on in Russia and passing didactic judgment on each individual item.
It is important that this summit has brought concrete results, laying a foundation on which internal and external security may be established, economic cooperation guaranteed, and joint projects in research, education and culture facilitated.
What struck me as very important in todayâs debate was what Commissioner FerreroWaldner had to say: if the whole thing is to work, Europe must speak with one voice.
In that case, it will not be acceptable for individual Member States â Germany, France or Spain â to hold separate summits with Russia and pursue a contrary policy, without, moreover, informing either our Baltic friends or the European institutions.
One might be so bold as to say that Germany will refrain from such things after September of this year, but in the case of France and Spain we will, no doubt, have to live with it for some time yet.
By way of a final comment, let me say that cooperation in regional conflicts appears to me to be very important.
Reference has been made to Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and NagornoKarabakh, and the EU has offered to help in Chechnya as well.
Rather than being limited to humanitarian operations, it must also have a political dimension, and Russia would be well advised to respond to this signal from Europe.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m for her openness and cooperation in working out a balanced and productive parliamentary position.
Positive developments have recently taken place in EURussia relations.
We warmly welcome the adoption of the single package of roadmaps for the creation of the four âcommon spacesâ at the last EURussia summit in Moscow.
We consider this a breakthrough in the EURussia strategic partnership.
We are both committed to multilateralism, which is the only solution to global problems.
Therefore, we should work together in reforming the United Nations.
We as European Socialists regard Russiaâs ratification of the Kyoto Protocol as a highly positive step.
We acknowledge Russiaâs constructive role in the fight against terrorism and in nuclear disarmament.
We look forward to mutually beneficial energy cooperation with no added political motivation.
We should support the accession of Russia to the WTO.
However, we should not forget about divergences of opinion or disputes.
We are deeply worried about the weakening of democracy in Russia.
We also call on Russia to ensure better protection of national minorities.
Without a readiness to reach a compromise and start a reconciliation process there can be no chance of ending the suffering and developing a lasting peace in the framework of a wide autonomy for the Republic of Chechnya.
The European Union and Russia can only develop a real strategic partnership if Russia fully endorses the basic European values and principles of democracy, the rule of law and full protection of human and minority rights.
It is in our common and vital interest to maintain Russiaâs democratisation, modernisation and European orientation.
There is no alternative to a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Russian Federation that is reliable, sustainable and mutually advantageous.
Â Â  .Â Â Â It goes without saying that cooperation with Russia is of key importance for the European Union.
The same also applies to the problem of secure energy supplies, to which Russia can provide a partial solution.
At the same time, however, there can be noÂ one who is not concerned at the way in which the major energy companies operate in Russia.
I need only remind the House that the head of Gazprom leads Putinâs cabinet, that his deputy chief of staff, MrÂ Sechin, runs Rosneft, and that MrÂ Ivanov,Â MrÂ Surkov and MrÂ Prikhodko are in charge of Transneft, Aeroflot and so on. This all begs the question of whether these companies are in fact operating according to market mechanisms, or whether they are instead instruments of Russian foreign policy.
A great many recent developments, such as the problems experienced with the supply of crude oil to Ukraine, suggest that the latter is the case.
A further question that needs to be addressed relates to the future direction of Russian policy.
NoÂ one could fail to be alarmed at the bill presented by MrÂ DmitriÂ Rogozin to the Duma, which, if it is adopted, will make it possible for Russia to incorporate whole new regions into the Russian Federation without anyoneâs permission.
Those justifying such a move have made it quite clear which regions are involved, and these include Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transdnistria.
This leaves us with the problem of whether we should not occasionally alert Russia to our concerns, which are entirely justified.
Of course, it will be Russia that decides on the future shape of our relations with Russia and on the future face of Russia itself, but I do not believe that there should be any letup in our efforts to highlight certain concerns.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner FerreroWaldner, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, ladies and gentlemen, Russia is very important in terms not only of our security and stability, but also of our economic and ecological development.
We want close cooperation with it in the widest variety of spheres.
Notwithstanding the many strategic reasons for this partnership, however, it must be based on respect for the European understanding of values.
It may well be the case that parts of the EU are dependent on Russian energy and raw materials, but this must not mean that we betray our democratic and human rights principles.
We must set an example and involve Russia in matters relating to the rights of minorities, in particular with regard to the protection of Russian minorities in the Baltic.
A comprehensive peace process must be set in motion in Chechnya, with the help of all democratic forces in society.
Military action is more than merely a dead end; it is a disaster, and not only that, but a crime.
The Stalin and Brezhnev eras may be things of the past, but the postCommunist tsarist approach of the Kremlin, with its restrictions on freedom of the press and information, renders a peace process in Chechnya impossible.
Our only hope is the development of civil society.
What we want is a political solution, and one that is reached with the assistance of the EU.
I was present when the handing down of sentences to MrÂ Khordokovsky and MrÂ Lebedev began in Moscow, and this sentencing, which is still in progress, is shocking evidence of the contempt with which the EUâs fundamental values â the rule of law, democracy and human rights â are being treated.
What other explanation can there be for these two people attending the preliminary hearing under heavy guard and in an iron cage, as though they were dangerous predators?
Large parts of the indictments were reproduced word for word in the grounds for the ruling, right down to the mistakes.
The breakup of Yukos is an economic death sentence, and Khordokovsky is not being given a fair chance in this political show trial.
Is this Russia worthy of being a strategic partner of the EU?
Proceedings in accordance with the rule of law are inseparable from human rights under any regime, and that is also the case in empires.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Commissioner, on behalf of all the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I should like to welcome the outcome of the EURussia summit.
Russia has been a source of fascination for all of Europe throughout modern history, or in other words since the Middle Ages.
On the one hand, we saw it as the successor to Byzantium and a bulwark for Europe against invaders from the East.
On the other hand, we regarded it as an Asian country, and thought of it primarily in barbarian terms.
On the one hand we saw its lofty traditions, the golden cupolas of its churches and its culture, whilst on the other we saw the staggering riches of its rulers and the extreme poverty of millions of its citizens.
Opposing views of this kind are still to be found in todayâs motion for a resolution.
On the one hand, Russia is described as a major supplier of raw materials that are vital to the European Union, as well as an enormous market and a potential ally of European culture and traditions.
On the other hand, misgivings are voiced regarding the great expanse of Eastern Europe and Russiaâs powerful armed forces, which are equipped with modern weapons and which have already been involved in a number of peacekeeping missions with EU troops, for example in the Balkans.
The authors of the resolution should have reserved attacks of the kind to be found in the part of the resolution demanding common standards of behaviour for the armed forces of another of our partners, if we are to believe the reports from Iraq.
I am assuming, of course, that the necessary steps have not yet been taken in this respect.
The contradictions I mentioned previously can also be seen clearly in a number of amendments.
I would call on the Members of this House to remember who it was that protected Europe from the Nazi terror 60Â years ago, and, even as they criticise totalitarianism, to avoid succumbing to Russophobia.
When voting on this resolution, we should ensure that a spirit of constructive cooperation prevails over mistrust and condescending advice.
After all, we cannot ignore the fact that millions of Russians died in order to liberate Europe.
We should never fail to make a clear distinction between the loyal ally which played a large part in liberating most of Europe, and which fulfilled its commitments towards its other allies in Asia 60Â years ago, and the country that attacked us.
This distinction should also be reflected in the relevant parts of our resolutions and debates.
When fervent advocates of democracy talk in this Chamber about the problems experienced by national minorities in Russia, even though they themselves come from countries where hundreds of thousands of citizens have not been granted citizenship, I find it hard to know whether they are making fun of all of us, or whether they are merely demonstrating barefaced cheek and a shaky grasp of what democracy means.
We need Russia as the European Unionâs closest ally, and we need it as a friend, in order to resolve the everincreasing problems with which the world today confronts us.
Friends should be asked, not ordered to do things, and Members of this House should remember this when voting on the resolution tomorrow, whilst ensuring that their own personal views take a back seat.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, modernday Russia inherited the historical legacy of the Soviet Union, and regards itself as the rightful heir to the latter.
It stubbornly refuses to make any kind of attempt to account for its criminal past in its relations with neighbouring countries, including Poland.
This past includes the MolotovRibbentrop Pact of 23Â AugustÂ 1939 and the genocide such as that committed against Polish officers murdered in Katyn, Kharkov and Mednoe in 1940 and in numerous NKVD dungeons over the following years.
Another burden that weighs heavy upon present relations between the EU Member States and Russia is the fact that the latter has made no apology for the communist dictatorship that was imposed upon the Central and Eastern European countries after the end of the Second World War.
When voting on todayâs report, we should not forget that the arrogance and hypocrisy displayed by the Russian authorities with regard to the issues I have mentioned, together with Russiaâs current policies, on Chechnya, Georgia, Moldova and the Baltic states, blatantly violate democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and hence the values to which the European Union so readily subscribes.
Â Â  .
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is interested in developing good relations with Russia, and this process has to be a bilateral one.
There are spheres where this has happened successfully, but in other spheres matters have actually worsened.
The countries of Europe have had differing historical experiences of relations with Russia.
For Latvia and the other Baltic States the experience was particularly tragic.
The USSR occupied the Baltic States twice.
Over 60Â 000 innocent people were sent from Latvia to Siberia in cattle trucks, without any legal process, and only a few returned.
To a great extent the deportations were carried out so that the possessions and homes of those expelled could be handed over, lock, stock and barrel, to the new settlers.
Russia must acknowledge the occupation of the Baltic States.
This would also make it possible to legally distinguish national minorities from immigrants, whose rights in Europe are regulated by entirely different laws or norms, as my fellow Members have stated here; this is a subject on which Latvia has to listen to unfounded accusations by Russia.
Our duty in the European Parliament resolution is to send a clear signal to Russia, stating that the retreat from democracy which we have observed recently is unacceptable.
In order for us to be successful, it is important for the countries of the European Union to speak with one voice to Russia, and also to pull no punches in calling things by their real names.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the MalmstrÃ¶m report is a balancing act.
Let me say straight away that the European Union quite obviously always gives priority to countries that are members of the European Union, and that these countries are granted particular protection and support for historical, political and economic reasons.
In this instance, this applies primarily to Poland and the Baltic states.
Secondly, we cannot ignore the fact that Russia is undergoing a major transformation, and that throwing off the Soviet system is a key aspect of this process.
The success of the latter in many areas means that supporters ofÂ the old Soviet system now appear to have no real chance any more of being elected in Russia.
Thirdly, we must realise that a process of this kind can only work in theÂ long run if it is based on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, and we must acknowledge that there are grounds for criticism in this respect.
This brings me on to my fourth point, however, which is that we must keep lines of dialogue with Russia open.
It is for this reason that we are building a strategic partnership, which has been embodied in the four common areas, for example, and the common energy policy, which will be formulated in such a way as to prevent onesided dependence on our part.
The events that will take place in 2007, and our joint preparations for these events, will also be a focus for this strategic partnership, as 2007 will see the expiry of the partnership and cooperation agreements, the holding of elections in Russia and the planned entry of Russia into the WTO.
Enlargement will perhaps have been completed by this time, and we may even have a constitution.
It follows that we must make sensible preparations for 2007, when all these events may take place.
In my opinion, and even though we must continue to voice our criticisms, it would therefore be useful to emphasise the importance of keeping channels of dialogue open.
This would allow us to help ensure that developments in Russia move in a sensible direction, which is in both our interests and our neighboursâ interests, and would help prevent fresh outbreaks of hostility.
Most importantly, dialogue with Russia is necessary because we need the countryâs help on such matters as the Middle East, the UN and the Security Council.
Even though criticism is necessary, therefore, we should also maintain a spirit of friendly cooperation, and we should continue to pursue the goal of achieving such a balance.
Â Â  Mr President, two weeks ago, after a long preparation period, Russia and the European Union reached agreement on how their strategic partnership should take shape, thus demonstrating that the European Union and Russia can make strides forward in their mutual relations despite the previous impasse.
Does this agreement mean that all questions surrounding EURussia relations have been answered?
The answer is still in the negative.
While the roadmaps that have been laid down indicate to both partners where they can begin to improve their cooperation in a number of areas, other questions remain unresolved, and I should like to single out three of them.
Russia and the European Union have a large number of common interests in the areas of the economy, energy, security and the fight against crime.
At the same time, it can be said that there are worrying developments within Russia as regards the values for which the European Union stands, not least democracy, the rule of law and transparency.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m was right, in her report, to devote a great deal of attention to this.
In its approach towards Russia, the European Union must try to strike a balance between those values and interests, one that will, at the same time, enable us to have a positive bearing on Russiaâs internal developments.
The establishing of a transparent democracy and economy in Russia is not only a theoretical concept in the longer term; it is also a matter of common concern to the peoples of Europe and Russia.
In order to be effective on this score, the Member States must manage to keep their ranks closed in the direction of Moscow.
A second point is the resolution of the deadlocked conflicts in Moldova and Georgia.
The EU must do everything in its power to persuade Russia to adopt a more cooperative stance, and we must capitalise on the room in the agreements recently concluded.
Finally, Russia is a crucial factor in the success of the Neighbourhood Policy in the new neighbouring countries, but policymaking and implementation are far too inadequate for the time being.
The EUâs Russia policy must take greater account of the neighbourhood policy objectives, which should not become secondary to relations between Europeâs capitals and Moscow.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the way in which the European Union has dealt with Russia does not inspire me with very much confidence, certainly not when one considers the terrible war in Chechnya.
Indeed, in their talks with Putin, most Heads of Government avoid sensitive issues such as the war in Chechnya and observance of human rights.
If they do say anything at all, their views sometimes conflict.
In the European journalist Ben van der Veldenâs book. âEuropean powerlessnessâ, I read a transcript of an interview between the author and Commissioner Patten.
On 27 October 2003, Commissioner Patten had the following to say about his contacts with the Russian Government, and I quote: âMy unusual opinion is that you do not achieve anything with friendly meetings.
You have to look at what you get from the other party.
At summits, you must also be prepared to make a nuisance of yourself about an issue such as Chechnya.â
This House has always stood for an inclusive peace process, in other words a process that encompasses all layers of Chechen society, inside of Chechnya but also the rebels who renounce terrorism.
It is true that at summits, the nonobservance of human rights and the fight against international terrorism should be on the agenda, but so should a political solution, which we should try to enforce.
With all due respect, Commissioner, it is a bad thing to talk about support for socioeconomic recovery on top of the desperately needed humanitarian aid, without there being a serious solution to the conflict.
I have visited Chechnya and Grozny, and I saw what happened with the funds.
Either they are used to erect government buildings or they will soon end up in the hands and pockets of criminals such as Ramzan Kadurov.
That is a reality, and perhaps we should acknowledge that a flexible approach does not work in Russia.
Maybe we should acknowledge and do what Khrushchev did at one time in a meeting for the United Nations: he took off his shoe, pounded the table and said âThis is my willâ.
Why does Europe not do this in relation to the war in Chechnya?
Â Â  â Mr President, we need to examine how we look on Russia â from which point of view we look on Russia.
From the point of view of the Americans, we will look on her as an adversary; from the point of view of the former Warsaw Pact, we will look on her with fear.
The point is: do we look on her as a country with which we can cooperate?
We are laying down conditions here.
Let me read in particular condition 24, in which the EU 'asks Russia to reaffirm its commitments to the territorial integrity of Georgia and Moldova and to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova in accordance with the request of these sovereign states'.
And rightly so.
Why did you not impose the same condition on Turkey and ask it to withdraw its military forces from an occupied country which is a Member State of the European Union?
Why the double standards?
Why are we asking Russia to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova â and rightly so â but not asking the same of Turkey?
You are asking Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on the environment.
And rightly so.
Why did we not ask the same of the Americans, who pollute the environment 16 times more â according to official statistics â than Russia?
Mr Barroso made a distinction earlier between demagogy and democracy.
I greatly fear that the Commission and the Council of Europe are being demagogic on this matter.
Â Â  Â Â Â When discussing our relations with Russia, we frequently think in terms of the Russian people, the Russian culture and our dealings with Russian businesses.
It should come as no surprise that our thoughts on the matter are favourable.
At the same time, however, PresidentÂ Putinâs policies present us with a problem.
This is a man who violates human rights, who places restrictions on economic and political freedoms, who has reverted to a Stalinist interpretation of history and who has awarded a medal to GeneralÂ Jaruzelski.
The latter was joint commander of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and in charge of the defeat of Solidarity.
âDivide and conquerâ has been one of the guiding principles of the Kremlinâs policies for some time now.
Russia maintains close, and even friendly, ties with certain EU countries, whilst snubbing others.
One could say that this is a political strategy that has been employed since time immemorial, but I would ask why the other side should have to sit back and allow it to happen.
At the same time, of course, we should be asking ourselves who this other side actually is.
Is it just a few Western countries whose governments believe that friendship with Russia is worth the extra expense, no matter what history has to say, are we referring to the countries of Eastern Europe that are subject to increasing pressure from Russia, or do we in fact mean the EU as a whole?
A great deal has been said about the EUâs common foreign policy recently, in particular with regard to the Constitutional Treaty.
The issue we are now debating will put this policy to the test.
Now the EU must send out a clear sign of solidarity to Russia, and a sign that we will gauge its good will towards the EU as a whole on the basis of its approach to the new Eastern European Member States.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, it is quite clear that cooperation with Russia is immensely important.
At the same time, however, the kind of Russia with which we cooperate is equally important.
As the rapporteur notes, our cooperation should be based on common values, but the fact is that Russia is moving ever further away from such values as democracy and civil liberties.
Common values are therefore a goal rather than a reality, and both the Council and the Commission should do everything in their power to ensure that this goal is achieved.
The second point I should like to make is that the agreement signed in Moscow is a real step forward in the dialogue between the European Union and Russia.
Amongst other things, it will make it possible for us to resolve local conflicts, such as those in Transnistria, Nagorno Karabakh, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.
At the same time, however, no mention is made in this agreement of the Chechnya issue.
This is absurd, as how can there be any question of forging a common policy with Russia or establishing a common area of freedom, security and justice if no reference is made to events in Chechnya?
The same is true for energy policy, on the subject of which MrÂ Schmit said that there was a prospect of removing obstacles to energy cooperation.
I should like to ask the Council and the Commission whether this means that they would be in favour of the Baltic pipeline.
The latter would run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, and could facilitate a diversification of energy sources for various EU Member States.
Thirdly, the success achieved by all of us will depend first and foremost upon the coherence of our common foreign and security policy, and the extent to which it takes into account the interests of all the 25Â EU Member States.
I would stress the word âallâ, as we cannot afford to allow Russia to play off certain EU Member States against others.
What kind of EU would we have then, and what kind of community?
My country, Poland, is essentially interested in cooperating closely with Russia.
Yet for many years now, Russia has attempted to prove to the world, and to the European Union, that Poland is holding back dialogue between Russia and the West.
It should therefore be stated in plain terms that we are emphatically in favour of a pragmatic and coherent approach which involves working as partners, and which takes into account the interests of all the EU Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr PresidentinOffice of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by warmly thanking MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m for the excellent cooperation.
We did not see eye to eye on every aspect of the first draft, but MrsÂ MalmstrÃ¶m managed to incorporate a great many of our ideas and to draft compromise amendments.
This has resulted in a very broad consensus, and I should like to thank her on this score.
I believe that the report we now have before us achieves a good balance between the views of those who believe that we should regard Russia first and foremost as a strategic partner, and of those who believe that democracy and human rights must be the focus of our relations with the country.
I see no contradiction between these two approaches; in my opinion, it would be unfeasible to emphasise one and ignore the other.
Furthermore, I believe that this is the message that emerges from this report.
There can be no question that Russia is a strategic partner for the EU, but we would have preferred to see it actually acting as such during the events in Ukraine.
Ukraine would also have been glad had this been the case, but unfortunately it was still too early for such a thing.
We would be delighted to have Russia as a strategic partner with regard to policies on Belarus, and if this were to happen there would surely be no limit to our success in developing democracy.
The same applies to South Caucasus, and we would also be glad to have Russia as a strategic partner with regard to Georgia.
Yet such strategic partnerships must not be conducted on Russiaâs terms, or even on Europeâs terms; they must be conducted in accordance with the terms laid down by the peoples of Georgia, Ukraine and Belarus.
In my opinion, therefore, this is precisely the direction in which we must move.
We must constantly remind Russia that we want to act as its partner, but the basic requirements for such a partnership must remain unaltered.
Commissioner, you said that we must speak with one voice, and it is my belief that this House is prepared to do so.
Should you run into any problems when dealing with the Council, I would advise you to ask this House for its assistance, as we will give you our full backing.
Â Â  .
Thank you, Mr President.
We all acknowledge how important relations between the European Union and Russia are for the security and stability of the continent of Europe.
The peoples of Europe, however, differ in their conceptions of the possibilities and terms of forming relations with Russia, according to their historical experiences.
The history of relations between Latvia and Russia makes me cautious, in practice, in assessing the processes taking place in Russia now.
The fact that Russiaâs economic growth is closely tied to the rise in energy resource prices on the world market, and has not been accompanied by social and economic reforms, does nothing to engender confidence in longterm and stable growth in that country.
The parlous state of human rights in Chechnya, the increasingly clear display of authoritarian tendencies, the evergrowing focus on the glorification of Soviet totalitarianism, the return of Soviet symbolism, Russiaâs refusal to acknowledge the brutal occupation of the Baltic states carried out by the Soviet Union, and yet more â just as in Chechnya, Russia shows a complete disregard for the fundamental human rights that relatives of the victims of Soviet totalitarianism have to obtain archive information on the Soviet Unionâs executioners, coupled with Russiaâs delays of almost 10 years in signing the border agreement with Latvia.
These are the realities of todayâs Russia, and they make me worried.
Â Â  Mr President, EURussia relations are not at their most cordial at present, after a serious loss of face for Russia following Ukraineâs Orange Revolution six months ago.
President Putin seriously overestimated his ability to impose his chosen candidate on the Ukrainian people, even if it meant rigging the election.
He wrongly expected the same reaction as shown by the EU to the flawed election the previous year in Azerbaijan.
Ukraine has now courageously sorted itself out and started out on an independent path â as has Georgia â and Russia, unsurprisingly, is not happy with this.
Neither is Russia particularly pleased with the role played by the independent Baltic republics with their enhanced status in foreign affairs as full EU members.
The statement by President Putin that they voluntarily agreed to be annexed by the Soviet Union is laughable.
The EU remains deeply critical of the widespread atrocities in Chechnya, including the extrajudicial execution of Aslan Maskhadov.
Russia, however, is fortunately now making some moves towards punishing those responsible for some of the atrocities.
There remains strong appreciation of Russiaâs internal struggle against fundamentalism and support for the global war against international terrorism.
I support a strong Russia with its recognised international borders, but say âhands off Ukraine, Georgia and Moldovaâ, and I call upon it to help solve the Transnistria question.
I am also deeply worried by the rise in Russian antiSemitism.
Russia remains the EUâs strategic energy supplier and giant immediate neighbour, so we must encourage dialogue and shared values and develop the four âcommon spacesâ.
Russia must not be allowed to turn the clock back to authoritarianism and abandon its respect for democracy and human rights.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, one of the greatest challenges the European Union faces is to build relations with Russia, with both parties acting as partners.
Relations with Russia and the Russian people must be strengthened in order to allow us to engage in economic cooperation and to work together to establish international norms in Eurasia.
The European Union should pursue the goal of bringing Russia closer to the EU and to its standards and institutions.
To this end, it is essential that the EU coordinate its external policies on Russia, both at EU institutional level and at Member State level.
Relations with Russia should not be viewed as secondary to either shortterm economic interests or negative historical experiences.
Russian civil society should be a key partner for the European Union in its relations with the country, and we should support it in its efforts to promote democracy, media freedom and respect for human rights.
Modernday Russia is a heterogeneous country.
On the one hand, it is fighting a postcolonial war in Chechnya and violates the fundamental human rights of those living in this region.
On the other hand, however, it is a target for ruthless terrorist attacks, and a country that over the past 15Â years has undergone impressive democratic transformation.
Yet this country is under threat from the distinctive and authoritarian presidential system that is currently in place, as well as from state control over the media and violations of the rule of law.
Even as we level criticism at the system put in place by PresidentÂ Putin, however, we must never forget that there is also another Russia.
This other Russia found its full expression in the thoughts and activities of AndreiÂ Sakharov, who was both a great European and a great Russian.
The real Russia today, or in other words the Russia of the Memorial Society and the PEN Club, is defending Russian democracy, and it expects the European Union to support and help it in its efforts to build Russian democracy and to bring Russia and the European Union closer together.
Â Â  .
Ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the MalmstrÃ¶m report is the European Parliamentâs wish to discern in Russia a partner in practical, prudent and highquality cooperation.
Russiaâs attitude in resolving the boundary issue with Latvia confirms the need for the report.
Latvia lost part of its territory as a result of its occupation by the USSR.
President Putin obstinately calls this demagogy.
In view of this stance by the Russian powers towards historical truth and the fact that discussions about the border agreement between Russia and Latvia, which have lasted ten years, have reached deadlock, the fact that in this report the European Parliament is calling on Russia to settle the border with Latvia fairly and equitably is to be highly valued.
Unfortunately, Russia is still unable to demonstrate such a will.
I call on the European Union not to shy away from acting as a mediator in the fair and equitable determination of a border agreement between Latvia and Russia, to refuse to yield in the face of Russiaâs strength and blackmail, to assess Russiaâs attitude towards those countries once in its sphere of influence from a position of goodwill as testimony to a responsible understanding concerning the need for reconciliation between Russia and the European Union countries, and to Russiaâs understanding of democratic values.
Â Â  Mr President, there has been no shortage of historical references in this debate; for Germans, too, relations with Russia possess a specifically historical character.
I believe that all parties could unite in saying that German politicians are glad that, after many decades, good relations with Russia have been restored.
If one is to calculate quite coldly, on the basis of our own interests and of the security interests of the new Member States, I believe that their security interests benefit more from these good relations than they would do if the situation were reversed.
It follows, then, that it is negligent or worse to allow the EU to be used as a sort of trampoline, with the help of which one jumps up in the air in order to give the Russian bear a hefty thump on the nose.
I wholeheartedly endorse Mr Laschetâs earlier criticisms of didactic tendencies, and what Mr Brok had to say about keeping avenues of dialogue open.
I have to say, though, to Mr Laschet, that there are two things he should not do.
For a start, you should not share out the bearskin among the nations before the bear is dead.
Secondly, you should not make promises that you cannot keep, for I am quite certain that summits would take place between Germany and Russia even if Germany had a CDU government â and who knows, we may even see such a thing in 20Â yearsâ time.
You should not try to imply that such summits would no longer happen.
Â Â  Countries which were in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, or were part of that Union, maintain rather specific relations with Russia.
For the first time since the recent enlargement of the EU a resolution on this issue has been worked out, with us taking part in the work of this Parliament, the Parliament of a huge and powerful European Union.
However, it has nothing to do with the settling of accounts with Russia; this is the recognition of Russiaâs importance and a wish to see that country follow the main signposts of the transition to democracy, while searching for its own way.
Can a country head towards democracy if the opposition in that country is weak and in decline, if freedom of press is restricted and the courts carry out the will of the authorities?
The answer is important for the entire European Union, for Russiaâs neighbours in particular.
Immense Asian Russia has been searching for a special road for hundreds of years, either getting closer to or more distant from Europe.
Now Russia has an excellent opportunity to make a choice.
It is very important to spell out the things which divide us, and to strive to diminish those differences and outline the things which unite us.
We would like to cooperate with a neighbouring Russia, which is not just a strategic partner, but a reliable associate sharing our values and focussed in its search for the way ahead.
I believe this would also be in Russia's interest.
Â Â  â Mr President, Russia should become a privileged strategic partner and the development and extension of the partnership in all sectors should be a basic and constant strategic priority of the European Union over coming years.
Noone can doubt that Russia has a great deal of potential to play a decisive role in consolidating international security, stability, peace and a balanced international order.
I believe that cooperation is needed in order to resolve international and regional crises within the framework of the UN and to prevent the imposition of unilateral solutions.
The experience gained from joint participation in the Quartet to resolve the Palestinian problem, which resulted in the roadmap, should be applied to other regional problems, such as Kosovo, the crisis in the Caucasus and the crisis in Central Asia.
There is, however, a lack of trust between the two sides which the enlargement of the European Union has exacerbated rather than reversed.
Enlargement should be a bridge for cooperation; it should not create new divisive walls.
From this point of view, the European Union and the new Member States have a great deal of responsibility.
We cannot help to build strategic relations with Russia with the syndromes of fear and the experience of a traumatic past.
The crucial factor for the future of relations between the European Union and Russia is the configuration of a joint European strategy in which all the Member States will talk the same language, not on the basis of national priorities on individual interests.
We, as the European Union, need a cohesive and integrated strategy with vision and inspiration in our relations with Russia.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I agree that we must strike the right balance, and we also have to address every question very clearly and frankly.
The important thing is to have a frank dialogue and a dialogue on every question.
That also means a dialogue on human rights questions and, for instance, on difficult issues like Chechnya.
I must say that we have had this very clear and frank dialogue.
President Putin himself has been very open.
So, I see movement, although it is not yet sufficient or exactly what we want.
We must continue in this direction.
This interdependence means that we must go further.
For instance, on Chechnya, we have spoken clearly about the necessary political solution: there has to be territorial integrity but, at the same time, there must be some sort of autonomy for the people there and then there have to be free and fair elections.
We in the European Commission feel that we must do something for the population: not only provide humanitarian aid, but also assist in reconstruction.
We are thinking of technical assistance, as I said: training for medical doctors and teachers in the EU Member States; scholarships for students; the provision of medical and teaching equipment.
There must be job creation and new activities for the future generation.
These are concrete actions.
On the question of history, we know that there are still some very difficult, delicate issues between the Baltic States and Russia.
It is really up to the historians to clarify the past so that our people can then reflect on the dark pages of European history.
But our priority must be to look to the future and, in this regard, I repeat exactly what I said: we have to raise every question openly, whatever it may be.
On the BakuTbilisiCeyhan pipeline, I can only say that it has been inaugurated today with the strong support of the European Union.
Finally, we will go on taking implementing action and we will take your comments into account, including comments on the need to guarantee human rights, democracy and stability.
However, at the same time, we must also look to Russia, our strategic partner, for solutions to problems in its neighbourhood and for solutions to problems with ourselves.
Â Â  Â Â Â I should like to thank the Commissioner for her answer, or rather for her attempt to answer my question, as I did not ask about the Caucasus pipeline.
I was asking about the Baltic pipeline, which is intended to run along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I wish to tell the honourable Member that there seems to have been a mistake.
I have heard this in a different way.
I can only say that this is a commercial project and have nothing else to add at the moment.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs GÃ¡l, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on promotion and protection of fundamental rights [2005/2007(INI)] (A60144/2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, during the present period of debates, referenda and parliamentary ratifications of the EU Constitution, we have all heard the arguments about the reasons for democratic deficit within the Union, and we are well aware of the need to make the work of community institutions transparent and to bring it closer to the people.
At present, the work of the Unionâs legislative bodies is often shrouded in scepticism and lack of concern.
It is our especial duty and obligation to change this.
This aim could be accomplished by means of the careful definition of the mandate and function of the Fundamental Rights Agency, the guarantee of its efficient operation and for its role to be known as widely as possible.
The Unionâs announcement, that development has shifted from an economic community to a political community of common interests, is timely and if the Union is to have a Constitution that includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the human rights dimension must also become stronger.
Since it is one of the principles of the Union that fundamental rights should be treated with priority in its policy, an Agency should be set up to monitor whether these highsounding fundamental principles are being observed and to ensure that exercising fundamental human rights becomes a peopleoriented, everyday practice instead of just bare legislation.
And now, Mr President, let me continue in English.
Mr President, following the decision of the European Council in December 2003, this owninitiative report seeks to set out the means towards the aim of extending the remit of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia and converting it into a Fundamental Rights Agency.
The committee and the groups agreed on my approach and although 120 amendments were tabled to the report, we managed to achieve 25 compromise amendments by which all the members of our committee have contributed to the development of fundamental rights within the Union. This led to an absolute majority with only three votes against.
The core issues during the debate on the report in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs focused around certain problems.
One was whether a new agency should be established at all.
The main argument here, especially on the side of the PPEDE Group, was that there are already too many agencies that are not sufficiently costeffective and that thereby many of the tasks of the European institutions, such as Parliament or the Commission, would be delegated to agencies.
I tried to make a clear point in this respect in my report.
The credibility of the Agency, and our credibility, will be ensured by its welldefined mandate and structure.
The committee also asked that Parliament should have a more important role in the structure, mandate and work of this body.
As a main legal basis had to be found, we invoked Article 13.
But I must emphasise that this Agency has to have a broader mandate, covering the Charter of Fundamental Rights in its totality.
Therefore I ask the Commissioner not to interpret this article only in a restrictive sense.
We have to make the hardly understandable legal language and structures clear, effective and operational and we need even more active cooperation between Council, Commission and Parliament.
I can see this Agency cooperating, building the information it gathers on a network of networks, in which we can find a clear way through the jungle of European, national and regional institutions and centres dealing with human rights throughout Europe.
Cooperation has to be a keyword in this field when we look at the Council of Europe.
It is important to use and build upon what has been achieved so far in the Council of Europe, not only symbolically but also in practical daybyday terms.
It is important that a functional model of cooperation be developed, as was emphasised at the Warsaw Summit.
I think that the Agency could be a means towards this end.
The protection of national minorities has become a very important issue since EU enlargement and it has also become clear that combating xenophobia and discrimination is not enough in itself to guarantee minority rights.
It is certainly a crucial move to create equality of rights and not to tolerate discrimination.
However, this is only one, surface treatment of the subject.
In order to get a firm grip on tackling this problem, it is not enough to treat the symptoms, but we must dig to the roots and treat the malady in order to create equal opportunities.
This complicated subject must be examined from various perspectives.
Therefore, a separate section of the Agency must deal with traditional national minorities.
It is a very sensitive task, and a great challenge today, to monitor the implementation of rights and to find a balance between the granting of individual freedoms and achieving collective security.
Therefore, the Agency must stand in the centre of a European movement striving towards better observance of fundamental rights and it must apply all the knowledge from previous experience in this process.
The goal is to be able to put the fundamental rights into the centre of all possible policies and provisions, so that we can really think of Europe as a symbol of these basic freedoms.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, MrsÂ GÃ¡l.
Both myself and the Commission are in agreement with the outlook, the spirit and the aims of the report, which have just been mentioned.
Within the sphere of justice, security and freedom, the Commission has centred its operations on the promotion and protection of peopleâs fundamental rights.
Following the decision made by PresidentÂ Barroso before this House, we formed a group of Commissioners who are precisely responsible for coordinating the Commissionâs policies aimed at promoting and protecting fundamental rights.
My proposal to the Commission to carry out an impact assessment on each of its proposals ensuring the protection and promotion of fundamental rights has already been adopted.
It is a precautionary impact assessment, which allows the Commission to only adopt measures that will enable us to make progress in our attempts to better protect fundamental rights.
The request came from Parliament, and I was in full agreement.
Among the 10 priority measures included in the action plan implementing the socalled âHague Programmeâ for a European area of freedom, security and justice, which was approved by the Commission on 6 May, I have placed the principle of Europeâs promotion and protection of fundamental rights at the very top.
This emphasis clearly demonstrates how, in my opinion, the protection of fundamental rights is a priority that cuts across all of the Unionâs policy areas, particularly when, as has been stressed a number of times, including in front of this House, it is a case of balancing citizensâ strong calls for security with respect for peopleâs fundamental rights.
I entirely agree with the rapporteurâs calls for a European agency equipped with a broad remit, which is able to truly take charge of promoting and protecting all fundamental rights. A broad remit, which would justify a new agency being created.
I too am convinced that there is a need to very clearly state that only a strong and effective agency can justify the conversion of the Vienna Observatory, as decided by the European Council and approved by this House, into a genuine European agency.
I would add that this is, however, on the understanding that the agencyâs objectives are the protection and promotion of fundamental rights.
On behalf of the Commission, I can state that the report presented today meets with our full approval.
It is clear that Parliament must have an important role.
I agree, in fact, that it should participate in the agencyâs governing body â this is a symbolic aspect, but also an important one.
I also agree that Parliament should have its say in appointing the agencyâs director, but we obviously have to resolve any strictly legal issues, which do exist and which we must take into consideration.
They are issues concerning one or other legal basis, according to the remit that we wish to grant to it.
Beyond the choice of legal basis, which will correspond to the remit assigned to the agency, I can confirm once again the political commitment of the Commission to take full account of Parliamentâs proposals, amendments and guidelines, irrespective of the legal basis selected.
There are clearly many possibilities: the possibility of a formal codecision process, which would be restricted, however, as many of you already know from a legal analysis, to only certain fundamental rights, or else a different procedure.
Even if this different procedure were finally adopted, the political solution would not change in my opinion, that is to say, that it would remain the duty of the Commission to defend the proposals of this House and to take them before the Council.
Its duty would be to defend them in substance, even if the legal basis were to be different.
I therefore confirm this commitment, by once again thanking the rapporteur for her report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs GÃ¡l, on her exceptional work.
I consider that the report is complete and that its contents create preconditions for the protection of citizens' personal data and fundamental rights in general.
The incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Constitutional Treaty and the future accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will certainly create a legal obligation for the Union to promote the protection of human rights in all policy sectors.
International cooperation by the European Union in this sensitive sector must be strengthened.
At this point, I should like to comment on paragraphs 24 and 25 of the report and on paragraph 3 of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, where it says that collaboration between the Council of Europe and the Agency should assume an institutional form.
Consequently, in order for the collaboration in question to be effective, the states should apply the harmonisation for which provision is made in the resolutions of the Council of Europe.
Creating a culture of respect for fundamental rights should be the Agency's priority and should be implemented, among other things, by developing a communication strategy.
The structure of the Agency should, in my opinion, also support special departments to deal with mass media communication issues, such as, for example, the concentration of the media, transparency and freedom of the press and expression.
I consider that a 'yes' vote for this report will be a fundamental step and tool within the framework of freedoms and human rights.
Finally, the objective of the Agency is to develop a communication strategy which will help to create a culture of respect for fundamental rights and I think, despite any opinions voiced to the contrary, that this is a very important issue, as is its proposed structure.
That is why I believe that a more attentive reading of the specific point of the creation of the Agency would be constructive.
The rapporteur insists on and analyses this in her report.
Â Â  . Mr President, the old Vienna Agency has had something of a chequered career.
I myself was involved in one example where a very important report on antiSemitism seemed either to have been suppressed or improperly handled by that Agency, and it was my view then that far too much politics had been allowed to enter into the activities of the Agency in respect of that matter.
Therefore, I would like to have clear assurances, with regard to the new arrangements, that first of all the new Agency with these wider and different roles will be objective, that it will behave in a sensitive manner and not allow any politics to enter into its work.
On top of that I would also want assurances that it will be properly accountable through parliamentary control.
What disappoints me is that quite often we say this is intended, but in practice it does not occur.
So this time we must insist on these provisions and insist on these matters being secured.
The only other matter I would like to raise is the issue of the need for a separate gender institute.
I believe that it is totally unnecessary: we always have to careful about bureaucracy.
I am very satisfied that this Agency will do its work in such an objective manner that it will be able to cope with the extra burdens that will be put upon it by dealing with the issues that would otherwise be dealt with by a separate institute.
I congratulate Mrs GÃ¡l on her report and I certainly believe that with the kind of assurances that I am asking for it will have a successful start and a successful period of operation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrsÂ GÃ¡lâs report enables us to establish the European Parliamentâs priorities regarding the extension of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobiaâs remit to convert it into a Fundamental Rights Agency.
We hope that the creation of this agency will make it possible to establish a real policy on fundamental rights.
It is worth repeating that our top priority for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is the active promotion of fundamental rights.
I would like to remind you that the inclusion of human dignity in ArticleÂ 1 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights was a real change of direction.
We, and governments, must take an approach that takes account of the honour of each and every person, the basis for the dignity of every citizen.
People will be free if they have a place and rights in our society that we have organised to this end.
And we all know that the rights to speak and write freely, to elect oneâs representatives and to live as one wishes have no real meaning for people who, in their daily lives, do not have the necessary material means to ensure their dignity.
We all know that, without the necessary dignity, there is a risk that universal rights will benefit only some.
CommissionerÂ Frattini has made a commitment to present the report on the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency under the codecision procedure.
We have listened to what you have just said, Commissioner, but we would restate that we absolutely insist on this procedure.
MEPs are the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe.
As the creation of a Fundamental Rights Agency would have a direct effect on the daily lives of citizens, the opinion of the European Parliament must be clearly heard.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me thank Mrs GÃ¡l for a very good report and very good cooperation on all the amendments.
I am very pleased we are voting on this tomorrow.
Our Union is entering a new phase.
We are in the process of creating a legal obligation for the Union to ensure that fundamental rights are actively promoted across all policy areas.
The proposed Fundamental Rights Agency would be the practical tool in this work.
Its main mandate covers what happens inside the Union.
At the same time we know that just outside the Unionâs borders there are literally slave markets, where young women and girls are sold to be trafficked into the sex industry in different parts of our Union.
For instance, it is estimated that every day about 40 girls are sold from these kinds of slave markets in Moldova.
This is the worst case of human rights violation occurring in our part of the world and the Fundamental Rights Agency should be able to confront it.
Therefore I hope that this House will confirm the vote of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the effect that the Agency should also be able to cover third countries when they are involved in human rights issues affecting the Union.
I also hope that this House will state clearly that the future gender institute at the very least should work closely with and be situated in the same location as the Fundamental Rights Agency.
This is rational and costeffective, but more importantly it should be the obvious line of thinking for anyone who believes that womenâs rights are human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Union promises its citizens an area of freedom, security and justice.
The many threats to which we are exposed on a daily basis teach us that positive and proactive policies are needed not only to guarantee security, but also to secure freedom, as the latter is not merely a matter of justice.
The rapporteur is aware of this fact, and has based her report upon it.
I should like to thank her for doing so and to congratulate her, as this really is an eminently suitable basis for such a key decision.
I am well aware of how difficult this decision was, because I too, in my capacity as rapporteur on the ArticleÂ 7 procedure, have had a brief taster of the intragroup disputes that MrÂ Kirkhope also mentioned in passing.
It is my firm belief that these stem primarily from the perpetual fear that the European Union could regain authority in certain fields, rather than from any other fears.
My group is absolutely delighted that a number of principles have been agreed on in the course of these disputes.
This agency is intended to act in support of the Member States, rather than to take decisions on their behalf.
The aim is not to put in place blanket surveillance systems, but to provide institutional support, an earlywarning system and an instrument for awareness raising and dialogue.
Information and activities will be linked up by this agency rather than bureaucratised, and I believe that anyone working in this field will be aware of the urgent need for a European network of networks, as mentioned by the rapporteur.
The intention is not that courts should compete among themselves, but that legal disputes over the prevention of human rights violations in Europe should be avoided.
NoÂ one wants to see Europe assuming the role of Big Brother to the rest of the world, or for it to be overeager to see motes in the eyes of its neighbours; what we want is for it to take a critical look at itself, and to carry out continual and critical assessments of the human rights situation within its own borders.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, and to assure her of our support.
I hope that the Commission will give due consideration to Parliamentâs special role as an advocate of fundamental rights, human rights and civil liberties, and that it will also comply with this Houseâs wishes by providing an appropriate legal basis for this report.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate MrsÂ GÃ¡l on the important work she has carried out, because the creation of this agency for the protection and promotion of fundamental rights is a valuable body both to this Institution and to the European Union.
An independent body is required, which also has strong links with the European Parliament.
It is also important that, on this issue, codecision processes can be arrived at between Council and Parliament.
Another important aspect, moreover, is monitoring the situation with regard to fundamental rights violations in third countries.
All too often we are helpless bystanders and all too often our cooperation links pave the way for fundamental rights violations to take place in third countries.
I believe that the difference between this agency and the European Court of Human Rights should be highlighted.
The European Court intervenes in individual cases, whereas the remit of this agency will be to monitor a political system in its entirety, and to also monitor the legal instruments that may not comply with universally recognised standards in the area of human rights.
I believe that we are dealing with an extremely important matter, because all too often we, as Members of the European Parliament, report instances of human rights violations without having the means to prevent them from recurring.
Today, for instance, a boat sank off the coast of Lampedusa.
If it had been the first time, we could have considered it to be an isolated incident.
In contrast, such incidents occur all too often and it is necessary, therefore, to carefully assess the legislation in force.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing more splendid than human rights, or in other words the right to freedom and the right to truth.
Broadly speaking, genuine freedom is the most important of all human rights.
What this House is debating, however, is yet another new agency which is to be given institutional form, and which has been clothed in fine rhetoric.
This agency will of course be set up at the expense of European taxpayers.
A new law is being introduced that will prevail in the European Union, and this supreme law, my dear friends, is Parkinsonâs Law.
What this stands for is yet another desk, yet another few dozen secretaries and yet another few dozen policymakers, whose job will presumably be to cover up the truth.
This is a misguided way of doing politics, and it will get us nowhere.
What is needed is equality before the law and honest information.
This would guarantee the existence of a genuine democracy, in which people would choose what they needed and turn their backs on those who violated real human rights.
I protest at such an interpretation of human rights and at the establishment of yet another agency.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the EUâs key tasks is to protect fundamental rights.
At the same time, since these fundamental rights serve as a calling card for the EU, both inside and outside its borders, priority should be given to all measures that could lead to improvements in this crucial field, and we should lend our support to a human rights agency with a wideranging remit.
I would, however, add one important caveat.
The main EU institutions bear the brunt of the responsibility for protecting fundamental rights, since the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, Parliament represents the interests of citizens, the Council represents the interests of the Member States, and, most importantly, the European Court of Justice is the supreme body of legal protection.
This responsibility must not be disputed or otherwise jeopardised, and so there must be clear guidelines for the agency, which needs to play a subordinate role.
A broader exchange of knowhow and experience would allow overall improvements to be made to EU standards, and useful improvements could be made in this field if existing institutions, instruments and procedures were networked.
The latter must not be duplicated, however, and we must also avoid any increase in bureaucracy.
What is particularly important is that this agency should not be set up as a forum for bureaucratic carping.
It is for this reason, and not for the reason given previously, that paragraphÂ 47 of MrsÂ GÃ¡lâs otherwise excellent report should be rejected.
If the agency adheres to these guidelines, there is every chance that it will play a valuable part in protecting European fundamental rights, a task that â after all â falls to all of us.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the GÃ¡l report deserves our support.
Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union has legislated in sectors which touch more directly and indirectly on human rights.
The protection of personal data, the right to asylum, equal and transparent access to justice, the fight against every form of discrimination or the protection of minorities are central components of the promotion of human dignity in a Europe of the citizens and not simply of trade or of unilateral emphasis on security at any cost.
Now that it intervenes legislatively in these â and in all â sectors, the effect of future decisions by the Union on the fundamental rights of its citizens needs to be evaluated if the legislator is to be able to do his job properly.
However, paradoxically, no harmonising mechanisms or procedures have yet been provided for the European Union institutions, so that this evaluation can be carried out adequately.
Consequently, if we want to do our job properly, we need to acquire an agency, internal assistance if you like, which will support us in our job, such as the future Fundamental Rights Agency.
This organisation should not be a study centre; it should be an independent and particularly sensitive antenna which collects information and which evaluates and jointly assists with authority and independence the development and protection of fundamental rights, especially in the Member States.
Finally, it goes without saying that the credentials and structure of this agency must be predefined by the legislator, with the European Parliament therefore as colegislator.
This is the reason why the Commission's future proposal also needs to adhere to the codecision procedure.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to thank my honourable friend, Mrs GÃ¡l, for her report and to say that we are delighted to see that the question of promoting and protecting human rights is increasingly the subject of consultation between the Union's institutions.
The establishment of the Fundamental Rights Agency could certainly be dealt with positively and without too many problems, if we considered that it really might help to serve the purpose for which it is being created.
Nonetheless, we believe that there is always the real risk, on account of its plethora of duties, of the Agency's becoming nonoperational and inefficient.
The proposal to transfer the Centre on Racism and Xenophobia to this Agency may weaken its present remit.
It will not be easy to achieve the independence of the Agency, which must always be in a position to safeguard the balance between security and human rights.
However, the protection of human rights can be achieved not merely by creating competent agencies but, above all, through a real change of policies in a way such that racism against foreigners is not fostered, the strengthening of a police regime is not supported and, in general, its citizens' and everyone's rights are not undermined in the name of security.
In the hope that this will be guaranteed, we shall vote in favour of the proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, the proposal for an EU fundamental rights agency is the height of folly, even by the standards of this place.
It also anticipates ratification of the Constitution, which is unlawful.
Leaving aside the monumental waste of public money, it will ensure that human rights become a permanent source of conflict across Member States as the bureaucrats seek to keep themselves busy.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights was included in the new Constitution as one of the most misconceived documents of recent years.
A passing parade of political nonentities have given themselves the power to grant rights and freedoms to other people.
Far worse, they have given themselves the power to remove those rights and freedoms when it suits them or their successors.
These are not the actions of democrats.
My rights and freedoms, Mr President, are not in your gift and they are not at your discretion, they are my birthright.
This Charter and this proposal profoundly misunderstand the nature of human rights and they reflect this Houseâs obsession with social engineering.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to follow the honourable gentleman, Mr Mote.
With that contribution, he gives us evidence that he is an expert on political folly.
As a member of UKIP, he gives us a double affirmation of that.
Let me say Mr President, that discrimination diminishes every single one of us and if we stand by and do nothing, we endorse it.
That is why I welcome Mrs GÃ¡lâs report and the establishment of the fundamental rights agency.
However, we must not make too many demands upon the agency or it will fail in the beginning.
It needs to work in conjunction with the three institutions and ensure that the proposals coming from those institutions are compatible with and not in contradiction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our international obligations.
Its focus should be within the EU, but at the same time it should have a role in the formulation of our EU Association agreement.
I welcome this consultation process but I will pay more heed to the concrete proposals that will follow.
Let me say two things.
Mr Kirkhope, who is no longer in the Chamber, said that politics should not enter the work of the agency.
It seems to me that he wants to neuter the organisation before it begins.
Decisions to end infringement of fundamental rights must be taken in the political context and cannot be taken regardless of those consequences.
Indeed, some political delegations in this House have never voted in favour of nondiscrimination measures.
That in itself party politicises nondiscrimination measures and fundamental rights.
Mr PÄk was vehemently against this: European taxpayers will pay.
If European taxpayers had not paid, we would still be under the stranglehold of the demonisation that followed the Second World War and Soviet domination.
We must have the guts to pay for our freedoms and defend them.
If Mr PÄk and Mr Mote are against it, Mrs GÃ¡l must have taken the right route and I recommend this report to the House.
Â Â  Mr President, the introduction of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the European Constitution is a step forward in the Unionâs political dimension towards a more democratic and more social Europe.
This commitment to human rights must be given concrete form from now on and it must be obligatory for the fundamental rights dimension to be incorporated into any new legislative proposals.
As Socialist coordinator in this Parliamentâs SubCommittee on Human Rights, I am in favour of the creation of the Fundamental Rights Agency.
I understand the concerns expressed by certain Members, but I entirely disagree with their opinion; this is one of the most important agencies.
By means of the powers proposed in the report, the Agency will ensure that we act consistently in terms of promoting and protecting human rights.
We therefore support the decision that this initiative should be treated as a legislative initiative by the European Parliament.
I believe that it is very important for the House to demonstrate its support and to be heard where initiative on fundamental rights are concerned.
This democratic platform that we are going to create will benefit everybody: Member States, international bodies, civil society and third countries.
The request for transversality of fundamental and human rights must also, and especially, be taken into account in the Unionâs foreign policy.
Finally, this decision can only lead to greater and better promotion and protection of human rights, inside and outside the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I agree with many who have spoken before me, that we are witnessing a process of historic importance when we see that the EU has overcome its previous obstacles and has set the goal of representing and protecting human rights.
Its institutional structure should not frighten us, but we should rather give our congratulations for this initiative.
I certainly agree with people who believe that the protection of human rights must be viewed in a political context, there is no other way.
I would, however, like to emphasise the issue of cooperation between the institutions.
I believe that the various institutions that the EU has recently established, or will establish in the future, must prove that they are able to cooperate in an ideal fashion, strengthen each other, and really carry out effective work with the help of civil organisations and civil initiatives.
I, myself, am a member of an equal opportunities working group and believe that the Institute for Equal Opportunities, which is soon to be established, will need to participate in this work.
The work of the European Roma Forum, that âspecialisesâ in monitoring discrimination, may also contribute to the success of this future Institute.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank all those who have spoken and who have offered important contributions to the excellent work of the rapporteur.
I believe that EU action on fundamental rights and freedoms requires positive intervention and not only protection.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to illustrate what the agency must not represent.
It must not and cannot be a super court of law, or a new legislator, because the legislative function is entrusted to you, to the Commission and to the Council, and certainly not to the agency.
The agency must not and cannot be a bureaucratic structure for accusing the Member States, but rather an organisation serving all of the EU institutions, an effective organisation providing assistance to Member States and support for their policies.
It must not be an organisation for solving isolated issues or for spreading controversy, as someone said.
The agency can be none of those things.
I fully agree with those who said that we need European awareness directed towards the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms.
Duplications with other organisations and bureaucratic inefficiencies must therefore be avoided.
On this point, I believe that the work of the Council of Europe must be taken into consideration in the light of its farreaching importance.
We intend to agree upon a common line with the Council of Europe in order to avoid overlaps and to utilise its crucial experience.
Some people have reintroduced the subject of geographical competence: should its mandate be only inside the Member States or also outside them?
We will devote particular attention to the debate and to the decision that will be adopted by Parliament, but I believe that, to begin with, the agency certainly can and must have geographical competence inside the Member States.
This does not, however, exclude â with reference to candidate countries, for instance, or to those countries linked to Europe by the socalled neighbourhood policies â the possibility of action that does not consist of intervention, but of important monitoring efforts and of communicating information to this House.
I will conclude my speech by stressing the wholehearted desire of the Commission to maintain ongoing dialogue with Parliament, because it is unthinkable that, on such an important issue as fundamental rights, action should not be taken in direct and continuous contact with this House, paying attention to its opinions.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the oneminute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, vigorous protests have been voiced against offshoring on many occasions, both in this Chamber and elsewhere.
They are heard most frequently at times when businesses based in the old EU decide to move part of their production to the new Member States.
At the same time, however, the new Member States themselves are now starting to experience this problem.
The French company Thomson is relocating from Poland to China, and Vistula, a homegrown Polish manufacturer of brandname suits, is relocating to Ukraine.
This is only the thin end of the wedge, as the number of cases of this kind will continue to rise.
It is telling, however, that noÂ one in Poland is demanding that rigid legal obstacles be put in place to stop this process, even though unemployment is currently very high, and neither is the phenomenon of offshoring being used as a bargaining chip in political disputes.
In fact, quite the reverse is true, as everyone agrees that entirely different measures should be taken to prevent offshoring.
First and foremost, these measures should involve reducing labour costs and increasing the competitiveness of goods that are produced.
I believe that the Polish approach merits closer inspection, and I would recommend it to any country that is proposing to introduce draconian measures to the detriment of entrepreneurs who have taken the guiding principle of the common European market seriously.
This applies particularly to France and Germany.
Â Â  Mr President, the majority of the new Member States, unlike the old ones, do not enjoy a visa free regime with the United States.
The Washington administration has offered a roadmap to the new EU Member States to facilitate their qualification for a visa free regime.
The European Union could make a more significant contribution to the resolution of this issue.
This is also an issue of Washingtonâs political will, and this will is to a large extent shaped by the US Congress.
I would suggest that the European Parliament or the Committee on Foreign Affairs should address the US Congress to express the wish of MEPs that Congressmen should consider this problem in a constructive manner and in a spirit of goodwill.
A visa free regime for the new EU Member States would contribute to the strengthening of transatlantic links and would promote political, economic and human change.
This would once again demonstrate that all EU Member States are equal.
Â Â  Mr President, I just want to raise a case of the need for fair treatment of someone who has been arrested in Spain on an extradition warrant from Morocco.
I will not go into the details of the background, but it is the contention of myself, those people supporting him and the Fair Trials Abroad organisation that he is completely innocent of any charges.
Briefly, he helped deliver a boat to Morocco; several months later people using the boat were arrested for drug smuggling.
He had absolutely nothing to do with that.
However, he is detained under an extradition agreement between Spain and Morocco under which Spain and Morocco have agreed not to extradite their own nationals.
How, therefore, can it be that Spain could contemplate extraditing another EU national?
It is surely a breach of EU law, which requires nondiscrimination on the grounds of nationality.
I will therefore be pursuing this with President Borrell and asking him to take it up with the Spanish Government.
Â Â  Â Â Â I wish to lodge a protest on behalf of Polish nurses and midwives about the European Commissionâs plans to introduce legislation that would discriminate against Polish nurses to the advantage of nurses from other Member States.
The Polish authorities competent in such matters have the right and duty to determine the length of training in accordance with the requirements set out in the Directive, and to recognise qualifications on the basis of standard acquired rights.
Polish nurses are demanding that ArticleÂ 4(b) of DirectiveÂ 77/452/EEC be deleted, and that ArticleÂ 31(2) of the new proposal, which is intended to replace it, also be deleted, as they both contradict the fundamental tenets of Community law.
They have proposed that professional degrees and bachelor degrees be added to the list of qualifications in the Annex to the Directive.
Polish nurses should of course work in their home country, where they were trained.
Yet the country has been left in such a disastrous state, firstly by the totalitarian and communist regime, and then by the present liberal government, that some Poles have been forced to emigrate as a result of unemployment, or because even those who find employment are paid starvation wages of EURÂ 200, with prices in Poland being comparable to those elsewhere in the European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, several days have now passed since a young Italian woman, assisting in child support efforts, was kidnapped in Afghanistan.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to sign an appeal for her release.
Several Members, including MrÂ Brok, ViceChairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, have already signed the appeal calling on the Afghan people to isolate the kidnappers and contribute to the release of young Clementina.
I call on all Members to help us by signing the appeal or, if they prefer, to send an email independently to the Embassy of Afghanistan in Brussels and to the largest news agencies in Kabul.
I believe that the European Parliament, which received PresidentÂ Karzai during the last partsession in Strasbourg and which is helping the Afghan people in their return to normality, has the duty, in this tragic affair, to make its voice heard and its solidarity towards this young woman felt.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, on 18Â May I travelled to Cuba with MrÂ Protasiewicz.
The European Union suspended diplomatic sanctions against the Havana regime a few months ago, so that consideration could be given to the future shape of relations between Havana and Brussels.
Several weeks ago, my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament visited the country.
MrÂ Protasiewicz and I decided to visit Cuba together in order to take part in a meeting of the Cuban opposition on 20Â May.
Unfortunately, we did not succeed in doing so.
We were deported before leaving the airport, because our names were on the Castro regimeâs blacklist.
We were not allowed to cross the border, and were instead flown to Mexico, and from there to Europe.
I would ask the President of the European Parliament to lodge a protest with the Cuban authorities and to demand an explanation.
I would also ask him to include a debate on the situation in Cuba and relations with the Castro regime on the agenda for the next Strasbourg session.
Our relations with this regime must be based on respect for human rights and demands for the release of political prisoners in Cuba.
Â Â  Mr President, I take this opportunity to convey my deepest sympathy to the families of five young teenage girls who tragically lost their lives two days ago in Ireland in an accident involving a school bus in which they were travelling.
I wish those still in hospital a speedy recovery.
This matter is relevant to us obviously because of the horrific tragedy involving the loss of these young lives, but also because we have dealt with the use of seatbelts in public transport many times in this House with, I have to say, only limited success.
The deaths involved in such tragedies are often preventable, but we have to convince our Member States that when it comes to seatbelts, our childrenâs lives are not negotiable.
In Ireland there is no legal requirement for seatbelts on school buses.
Indeed, as a moneysaving device, companies providing school transport under government contracts are obliged to permit three children to use a twoperson seat.
I ask you, Mr President, to convey our sympathy to the bereaved families and the families of those injured.
To the Irish Government, please convey our concerns on the safety of children using school transport in Ireland.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, it is fortunate that a Polish Member is in the chair, as I wish to inform the House that the European Union tolerates certain practices in the Republic of Poland that blatantly contradict EU economic policy.
I refer to the fact that Poland imposes an excise duty of 3.1% on all cars with engine sizes up to 2Â litres that have been purchased in EU Member States, and of 13.6% on all such cars with engine sizes over 2Â litres.
The Polish parliament recently failed to pass a bill aimed at changing this law into one concerned with environmental protection, and this means that such dubious practices will continue.
The victims are potential Polish car buyers, and these practices brazenly flout all the rules that apply in the European Union, one of which is equality, or so we are told.
I would therefore ask for pressure to be brought to bear on Poland to ensure that it abandons such dubious practices, as they are detrimental to both Polish taxpayers and the European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is currently debating a compromise package for the 20072013 Financial Perspective.
The Luxembourg presidency recently sent a proposal regarding spending cuts to the governments of all the Member States.
If this proposal were to be adopted, total EU expenditure would fall by between 4% and 7% in comparison with the Commissionâs original proposal.
It is plain for all to see that the aim behind this proposal is to weaken cohesion policy.
A smaller budget would necessarily entail looking for ways to save money, and the Structural and Cohesion Funds, or in other words those targeted at the poorest EU Member States, would be hit hardest by such costsaving measures.
Regional aid, which mainly benefits the new Member States, is hence to suffer cutbacks as a result of pressure from the largest contributors to the EU budget.
It should not be forgotten that support for social, economic and territorial cohesion and solidarity between Member States are objectives that are enshrined in the European Unionâs Treaties.
We must be aware that it will be impossible to close the gap in standards of living which exists between the 15Â old Member States and the new Member States, and which came about as a result of the postwar division of Europe, unless we adhere to the principle of solidarity within the EU.
It also needs to be made quite clear that the cuts proposed by the richest countries are incompatible with the European Unionâs ambitious postenlargement goals.
Â Â  Mr President, this weekend there will be a vote on the European Constitution, and it is in our interests and in the interests of this House that even more information should be made available on the subject.
After all, we will all, on Monday, or very late on Sunday evening, be facing demands for statements on how we assess the Constitution.
With this in mind, perhaps it might be possible to have the Houseâs Press Service prepare statements on the subject for our President and other interested parties.
This Constitution is of particular importance to the public, and we are very keen that the vote should be in its favour and, above all, that the subsequent debate should also present a consistently positive view of it.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, along with several other Members of this House, I spent Monday in Belarus.
Our visit was connected with this countryâs violation of the right of national minorities to selfdetermination and the right to representation of the Association of Poles in Belarus.
MrÂ President, I should like to remind the House that presidential elections will take place in Belarus in less than a year.
In totalitarian countries ruled by dictatorships, such as Belarus, finding a scapegoat and pinning the principal blame for failure on national minorities is a tried and tested solution.
This is what has happened in Belarus.
The Association of Poles has become a scapegoat, and Poland and Polish diplomats have become public enemy number one in the country.
A programme being broadcast several times a day on two state television channels uses slander and lies to imply that Poland wishes to bring about the collapse of Belarus and to interfere in its domestic affairs.
The Belarussian Government did not recognise the democratic elections held by the Association of Poles.
Mr President, the only effective way in which the EU can gain any influence over what is happening in Belarus is for the European Union, the Members of this House and politicians to intervene and to provide support.
This would force the Belarussian authorities to recognise the elections held by the Association of Poles in Belarus.
I would ask for a debate to be held in the House on this issue.
It is a controversial issue that ...
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A60137/2005) by MrÂ Nassauer, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering, including terrorist financing (COM(2004)0448 â C60143/2004 â 2004/0137(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a political priority for the European Union.
The Commission adopted this proposal for a third directive on the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing less than a year ago!
And today it is before this House.
This testifies to the importance of this text.
Work has progressed fast because all the institutions of the European Union have been fully dedicated to ensuring that the European Union is equipped with stateoftheart defences in the field.
This directive builds on existing Community texts and incorporates into Community law the revised 40Â recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on money laundering and terrorist financing.
The directive tightens the controls in the financial sector against money launderers and terrorist financers and strengthens cooperation between countries.
Not only will the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing benefit from this, but so will the integrity and stability of the financial sector.
The EU is also setting an example for other countries in the world to follow and match.
The third antimoney laundering directive will prohibit money laundering as well as terrorist financing.
It is applicable to the financial sector as well as to lawyers, notaries, accountants, real estate agents and casinos, trust and company service providers as well as all providers of goods when payments are made in cash in excess of EURÂ 15Â 000.
These people need, firstly, to identify and verify the identity of their customer and of its beneficial owner and to monitor transactions with the customer, while taking into account a riskbased approach; secondly, to report suspicions on money laundering and terrorist financing to the national financial intelligence unit; and, thirdly, to take supporting measures, such as record keeping, training of personnel and the establishment of internal policies and procedures.
The directive is completed with a section on supervision and offers the possibility to take implementing measures.
With this updated system we have progressed enormously.
I should like in particular to underline the following elements.
The cooperation between the European Parliament, the presidency and the Commission on this directive has been extremely constructive. This shows not only the willingness to have a fasttrack adoption at first reading, but also the priority that all of us give to combating money laundering and fighting terrorist financing.
Furthermore, I especially appreciated the fact that we have all shown a sincere desire to achieve a compromise on the main issues, i.e. the definition of the beneficial owner, the definition of and the application of enhanced due diligence in respect of politically exposed persons, the coverage of trusts and lawyers and last, but not least, comitology.
In respect of comitology, I underline that in the actual situation the Commission as a maximum is willing to accept a sunset clause.
This clause provides for the suspension of the comitology procedure four years after the entry into force of the directive.
In accordance with ArticleÂ 251 of the Treaty, these measures may be renewed by Parliament and the Council on a proposal from the Commission.
I would like to thank Parliament in advance for making a first reading agreement possible and in particular I would like to congratulate warmly Mr Nassauer, MrÂ Muscat and the shadow rapporteurs on the quality of their work and thank them for the extremely constructive spirit in which they have produced their report.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union first adopted regulations aimed at combating money laundering in 1991.
These prohibited the laundering of money from drug trafficking, and obligations were imposed primarily on financial service providers, or in other words on banks.
In 2001, the scope of the Money Laundering Directive was expanded to cover a much broader range of offences.
Most importantly, its obligations were extended to cover a much larger number of professions, in particular lawyers and notaries.
This gave rise to considerable controversy at the time, and rightly so, because it raised questions such as whether lawyers would have to disclose confidential information they had learnt from their clients.
A compromise was reached at the time, which remains in force today.
The EUâs rules are based on recommendations from the ominoussounding FATF â the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering â which is a G7 body.
These recommendations set out harmonised rules on combating money laundering, and are especially useful in that they are also applied in other countries outside the EU.
It is, therefore, only sensible for us to incorporate these rules into our legislation.
The task now before us is to amend the money laundering regulations for the third time.
There are three reasons for this; firstly, the FATF â to which I have already referred â altered its recommendations in the summer of 2003, and these changes must now be transposed into law.
Secondly, the Commission had in any case been asked to provide a definition of the term âserious offenceâ, which it had failed to do last time.
The third reason, and perhaps the most important, is that the Directive will now also prohibit the financing of terrorism.
NoÂ one would dispute the need for this instrument in the fight against terrorism.
We agreed to adopt this Directive in a single reading.
Of course, this meant that intense and complex negotiations were necessary in order to accommodate the interests not only of Parliament, but also of the Commission and the Council before todayâs deadline.
I am glad to say that we achieved this goal, but we were forced to make compromises in order to do so.
What I am presenting to the House does not therefore correspond entirely to my own ideas, but unfortunately that is the nature of compromise.
Parliament was prepared to play its part to ensure that the Directive could be adopted as speedily as possible, so that instruments for combating money laundering and terrorism could be made available without delay.
Turning to the issue of impact assessment, there can be no disputing the fact that we must do something to stop money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
I should like to point out, however, that we have been presented with this Directive before we have had a chance to assess properly how effective the Second Directive has been.
It goes without saying that the new Directive will mean more bureaucracy and extra costs for financial service providers, lawyers and tax consultants, and in this day and age we must make quite sure that the demands we make of those concerned bear a reasonable relationship to the benefit we expect to derive.
It has not yet been possible to verify whether this is the case, and the conclusion I would draw from this is that no further amendments should be tabled before this House for the foreseeable future, or until the issue of whether our endeavours in this field serve any real purpose has been settled.
A number of improvements have been made to the Directive, and these include the incorporation of a riskbased approach, which will make it possible to refrain from further measures if the latter are not mandatory from the outset.
This approach is now enshrined in the Directive.
I should briefly like to touch upon three points of contention.
As a general rule, the Directive requires clients, for example of a bank, to be identified.
It further stipulates that a bank must inform the authorities if it suspects that money laundering is taking place.
It follows from this that the beneficial owners of legal entities must also be identified, and the question arises, with regard to public limited companies for example, of the number of shares that must be held in order to be regarded as a beneficial owner.
We agreed on a compromise of 25%.
As was to be expected, problems relating to politically exposed persons, or PEPs, caused somewhat of a stir in the House.
I would note, however, that this Directive is not in actual fact aimed at MEPs, but at persons who are guilty of money laundering or similar offences, and we were forced to find a way of making this rule workable.
We therefore came to a compromise whereby the residents of a Member State will be exempt from special surveillance measures, but that the latter will apply to residents of other Member States.
It is open to debate as to whether this is a good idea, but that was the compromise that was reached.
As a final point, I have every sympathy for the attempts that lawyers naturally made to gain exemption from this Directive, particularly in view of the fact that it was only when the latter was amended for the second time that they were included in its scope.
I myself would have been prepared to make the relevant changes, but I must admit that my pleas to both the Commission and the Council in this regard fell on deaf ears, and so the rules in question have essentially stayed the same.
At least some progress has been made, however, in that it has now been made clear that lawyers do not have to disclose information to which they become privy during confidential legal consultations or legal representation.
I should like to thank MrÂ Peillon and MrÂ Muscat, as well as BaronessÂ Ludford, for their cooperation, which made it possible for us to conclude the matter at first reading.
I would ask Members to vote in favour of this draft report tomorrow.
Â Â  It is a report about the Directive which for the first time speaks in a direct way about the concept of the financing of terrorism, as apart from money laundering.
In fact we are speaking about two totally different processes.
Money laundering âŠ
There is no interpretation!
That is what we get when we are told that Maltese is an official language of the European Union!
So there are no interpreters here; we have no interpreters in committee; we have no translations of documents; and now we are not even able to speak our language in plenary.
I am not going to continue to deliver my speech, Mr President.
No way.
You should take the necessary action on this.
What is the use of having it down on paper that Maltese is an official language?
I thank the Commission and the Council; I thank MrÂ Nassauer for his sterling work on the report, but either give us our language, or it is thank you and goodbye.
Â Â  I apologise, but there are technical issues involved.
I will try to see to it that it does not happen again.
Â Â  . Mr President, I happen to be the chairman of the committee on which the rapporteur and MrÂ Muscat sit.
I wish to begin by endorsing what MrÂ Muscat said.
In our committee it is always very difficult to get interpretation into the mother tongue from even large countries â Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic; countries that are now at the heart of our European Union.
However, if we cannot speak in mother tongue languages in this Chamber, where it is known that we have an interest in the debate taking place, what kind of European Union do we have?
I just want to endorse in the strongest terms what has been said here today by Mr Muscat.
I hope I will get injury time on Mr Muscatâs behalf for saying that, because I now want to make some warm remarks about the rapporteur, Mr Nassauer.
I want to thank him for the work he has done at a time when he was enormously engaged in the REACH proposals, which are now before our committee.
He has taken a subject of real public relevance: the security of the citizen and how best we ensure it.
He has found an effective compromise and I hope our own amendments in the IMCO Committee, of which he is also a distinguished member, will support that.
He has been able to tread the perilous path between alarmism on the one hand and complacency on the other.
My main concern with the amendments we tabled was to ensure that ordinary consumers would not be disproportionately inconvenienced in carrying out financial transactions, whilst we know that we need to combat money laundering.
This, of course, is not the first money laundering definition.
I do not know whether Thomas Jefferson would approve, but the times in which we live need a balance to be struck between liberty and security.
However, we do not want to exchange one category of vulnerability for another.
The vulnerable citizen can be made vulnerable by excessive security measures, as well as by the processes of terrorists themselves.
Just at the time that our committee was describing these matters, a terrorist bank raid took place in Northern Ireland â the largest bank raid in the history of that province.
That shows the importance today of stopping up the areas where terrorists operate and finance themselves.
The various draftsmen of opinions from the different committees have all provided the expertise which was properly supportive of what Mr Nassauer has done.
This is a compromise to which the banks, the lawyers, the accountants, the notaries and the ordinary citizen can look with confidence.
I hope this dossier will, therefore, be concluded at first reading.
Terrorists cannot succeed unless they have the financial means with which to do so.
We, however, need to measure our response to this unprecedented terrorism with the needs of the citizensâ own defences for the sake of civil liberties.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Nassauer and everyone else involved in what we hope will be a first reading agreement.
I was responsible for drafting the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee, which concentrated on two aspects: the position of lawyers and the process regarding, in particular, the review under the second directive.
When I say the position of lawyers, I mean not just lawyers but also their clients and their clientsâ access to justice.
All of us know that Parliament has received a number of petitions from bar organisations around Europe.
There have been legal challenges in Member States and, indeed, similar legislation had to be repealed in Canada because of a constitutional challenge.
There are therefore concerns about the position of lawyers.
It is with some sadness that we note that not all the amendments tabled by the Legal Affairs Committee in this regard were adopted.
Having said that, we are happy to accept the compromises.
However, with regard to the review, I asked the Commissioner in a written question if the review could still go ahead.
He assured me that it would be completed by 2006.
I would ask him to reiterate that assurance tonight and, if possible, tomorrow morning before we vote, so that lawyers at least know their position will be subject to review.
Â Â  â I should first like to commend Mr Nassauer on his excellent report, which received the backing of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
The Union, the Member States and the citizens must be protected by stepping up the fight against money laundering.
The perpetrators of this crime must not be allowed to take advantage of the free movement of capital and the free provision of financial services.
We must also address the issue of terrorist financing.
We are aware that these are two different crimes.
Money laundering is the concealment of the proceeds of criminal activity and lies at the heart of organised crime.
If we succeed in combating it, we will substantially weaken international organised crime networks.
Terrorist financing can also involve the use of goods acquired legally to finance terrorism; in other words, it does not necessarily follow that a crime has been committed but the act of financing, in and of itself, constitutes a crime.
A further objective is to widen the scope of the directive to cover other categories of profession, whilst ensuring that measures remain proportionate.
I welcome the fact that the compromise reached in the second directive, preserving the relationship of trust between lawyers and clients, has been retained.
The principle of confidentiality between lawyer and client is fundamental to an effective legal defence.
I should therefore like to raise three key issues: firstly, coordination and cooperation between financial intelligence units, which must be provided with adequate resources to carry out their work; secondly, those Member States that have yet to transpose the second directive on money laundering must do so at the earliest opportunity; thirdly and lastly, current legislation on money laundering must, as a matter of urgency, be assessed to monitor its relevance and its practical impact.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Nassauerâs report enables us to extend the fight against money laundering to terrorist financing by complying with the new international requirements.
Our work with the rapporteur was very constructive, for which I thank him quite particularly.
Parliamentâs positions have been heard by the Council, which has made it possible to reach a compromise, particularly with regard to three essential points that we support.
For the legal professions, we did not want to go back on the experience of the previous directive.
That enables us to retain a balance between the obligations regarding verification and identification requirements and the preservation of the right to a fair hearing and of individual freedom.
We very much regret, nevertheless, that the threshold for cash payments was not reduced to EURÂ 10Â 000 and that the threshold for percentage share holdings remains at 10%.
Similarly, we think it would have been preferable for casino customers to be identified and their identity verified for a sum of EURÂ 1Â 000.
One problem remains, namely that of tax and banking havens, some of which are still active on European territory.
In this respect, we find it regrettable that the amendment put forward in committee by MrÂ Costa and MrÂ Peillon was not retained.
I would like to add that the issue of judicial and police cooperation remains central and decisive in the context of the fight against money laundering, even though it is not covered by this directive.
Currently, the Member States still create too many obstacles for this cooperation to operate satisfactorily and to be effective.
We find this regrettable.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a political priority for the European Union is shown by the speedy progress of this measure.
The Commission adopted the proposal for the third directive only about a year ago and today it is before us for decision.
We have cooperated closely with the other institutions to complete it all in one reading.
I pay a very sincere tribute to the skill and cooperative attitude of Mr Nassauer as the rapporteur.
He has done a very good job.
The third directive brings in limited but useful changes from the second directive.
The great improvement â the theme of this directive â is the clear emphasis on a risksensitive approach, so that there is a âknowthecustomerâ obligation, including identifying the true owners of companies â the beneficial owners â which is higher if there is a higher risk of tainted funds.
Obviously, it is necessary to apply stricter moneylaundering controls in situations of higher risk, but I hope this will also mean slimming down with a simplified due diligence, as it is called, when possible.
At present, there are thousands â perhaps even hundreds of thousands â of alerts of suspicious transactions every year across the EU.
However, I fear that watchdogs often lose sight of the wood for the trees, and there needs to be more concentration on the really serious, suspicious transactions and breaking the criminal and terrorist financing networks.
I hope that in implementing the directive it will be possible for banks to be more proportionate and targeted in their checks so that individual honest citizens trying to open a bank account are not swamped in red tape, while the arms traffickers, criminal gangs and greedy dictators slip through the net.
The one, also useful, improvement is that this new directive will simplify the process, hopefully, for European citizens wanting to open a bank account in another EU country, as that bank will not have to carry out further identity checks.
Therefore, it reduces bureaucratic burdens on EU citizens and marks a practical step in making a reality of living in Europe and crossing boundaries.
Finally, we reached a satisfactory solution on trusts, making clear that the widespread and valuable use of this AngloSaxon vehicle in commercial and financial markets will not be prejudiced so that the City of London can sleep peacefully at night knowing that markets like the International Bond Market will continue to innovate and prosper for the benefit of the European Union as a whole.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, MrÂ Nassauer has undoubtedly produced a good report, to the extent that a decision has already been reached with the Council at first reading.
I would like, however, to highlight certain aspects that give rise to further thought.
We are debating the third directive without a clear insight into what have been the effects of the second directive.
This excessive and erratic haste, which should have led us to assess money laundering also in terms of the fight against terrorism, has, in my opinion, led us to rush through the process, when further reflection was required.
In particular, I believe that excessive attention has been paid to the matter of suspicion, when perhaps we should concentrate more on certainties, by ensuring individual guarantees.
The second aspect, which, in my opinion, remains unresolved, concerns the thorny question of lawyers.
On this matter, I believe that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs forcefully lays down some points for reflection that Parliament must consider further.
Â Â  . Mr President, I find it hard to believe that nobody questions the need for this legislation.
As Mr Nassauer says, we do not actually have any evidence that the existing legislation works, so making it tighter is hardly justifiable at this time.
The European Union is going out of its way, as usual, to make life difficult for ordinary businesses and citizens, and hindering business activity.
Much more sinister, in my opinion, is the obligation on professional advisers not to inform their clients when they report suspicious transactions to the authorities.
Turning professionals into secret informers erodes trust within society and marks the beginning of a police state.
A better way to address terrorism is to know who is entering and leaving our countries.
Alas, with the ongoing disagreements about how to police our borders and the drive for indefinite expansion of the Union, the prospect of reliable border controls is becoming ever more remote.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed directive being debated imposes an obligation in law upon independent legal professionals to record, register and declare confidential information provided by clients receiving legal advice to the financial services in the Member States.
As a practising barrister, I can state without any hesitation whatsoever that this would have a major impact on the independence of the legal professions, and that it would violate the code of confidentiality that is one of the fundamental principles of these professions.
A barrister who is required to work for a third party from the moment he comes into contact with a client would turn into a key witness, or in other words his own clientâs worst enemy.
To sum up, the scope of the proposed directive is such that it represents an unacceptable intrusion into the activities of independent legal professionals.
Derogations from antimoneylaundering measures must be granted for activities covered by professional confidentiality, in order to safeguard the proper administration of justice and the existence of a meaningful defence, rather than a sham one.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to take this opportunity to express my particular thanks to MrÂ Nassauer for having drafted this report, and to congratulate him on it.
It was no mean feat to coordinate all these amendments and to conduct negotiations.
The reason why this report is so important is that money laundering is not a trivial offence, and this is a point I should like to make to a number of previous speakers; it is a criminal act, and in fact one of the most serious, as it is both economically damaging and associated with extortion, drug trafficking and suchlike.
These are all facts that must not be forgotten.
It goes without saying that there are certain things that could have been added or left out, and that people will always find something to quibble about.
My hope now is that our decisions will finally be put into practice, and that in two or three yearsâ time we will then be able to assess their real impact.
It is for this reason that I regard it as so important that a report be tabled in this House in two yearsâ time to explain how effective these measures have in fact been.
I will admit that I would be delighted if the Member States were to rigorously implement even half of the reportâs proposals, as this would obviate the need for us to discuss a great many issues.
Many thanks, MrÂ Nassauer.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner McCreevy, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the rapporteur for the fact that we now have a report and for the fact that the European Parliament too is getting to overall grips with combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on which I sit, we have agreed that it is not enough for us to work at combating terrorism as a crime, but that we must also look into the causes of the global spread of terrorism and into where the money comes from.
To myself, as a former member of the Swedish parliament, it has long been clear that not only terrorism but also much of the criminal activity in our countries is financed on the basis of everything from the drug trade, legal and illicit gambling, prostitution and the trade in sex slaves to transfers of funds between banks and countries.
Obviously, we MEPs too have to be monitored like any other citizens.
I hope that the directive will lead to wider discussion in our home countries of what is known as dirty money.
The fact is that money laundering does not only finance terrorism.
It also corrupts our societies and is thus a threat to democracy.
That is why todayâs debate and directives are so important for the future, as well as for the European Parliament and the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank Members for their contributions.
The adoption of Parliamentâs opinion in line with the agreement reached with the Council will pave the way for the early adoption of this directive.
This would not have been possible without a spirit of cooperation and compromise on all sides and the political will to make it happen.
I would like to thank you warmly for this.
The European Union is in the vanguard of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, adding to its credibility and weight in its bilateral relations with its main diplomatic partners as well as in the different international fora dealing with these matters.
Mrs Wallis raised the issue of the treatment of lawyers.
The Commission is favourable to the amendment to ArticleÂ 39, which foresees that within two years of the expiry of the deadline for transposition of the directive the Commission will draw up a report on its implementation, which will include the specific examination of the treatment of lawyers and other professions.
But, in any case, I reiterate my firm intention, as also expressed in replies to parliamentary questions, to carry out by mid2006 an examination of the treatment of lawyers and other legal professions, amongst others, as foreseen in the second directive, which is still applicable.
Let me once again thank Mr Nassauer, Mr Muscat and all the others who have contributed to this positive outcome.
The Commission fully endorses the agreement and accepts all amendments that form part of the compromise package agreed with the Council.
