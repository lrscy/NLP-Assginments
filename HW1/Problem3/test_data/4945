Your presence has been increased more, with the troika and the presidential triumvirate, but we have gained in a relative sense.
You are perfect hosts.
You have not said what you think about 'more Europe' .
Is it a cause for amendment?
In any event, Mr President, I believe that the great majority of this House is in favour of constitutionalising the process, of creating a Federation of States and Citizens.
Ladies and gentlemen, we do not see the Convention as a battle between parties and in this regard I must point out that Mr Berlusconi said in Le Monde on 12 January that we are in favour of centralising everything.
Centralising what?
The media?
In this respect we really are willing to jointly defend our project.
A final word on governance and codecision.
You applaud the Mandelkern report, but we are not familiar with it and that concerns us very much.
We have yet to debate the Lamfalussy procedure.
We do not support the report of a distinguished official of the Council whom we do not know and which may go against the principle of codecision.
You must speak to us and sow and tend the crop, as well as harvesting it.
Let me remind group chairmen and colleagues that we have votes scheduled for later this morning.
I should like to keep on schedule.
Mr President! Prime Minister, you have chosen More Europe as the theme for your presidency.
Liberal Democrats hope that this will be reflected in your commitment to enlargement of the European Union.
Just as this House insisted on Iberian enlargement some 15 years ago, despite doubts in certain national capitals, so we will militate for an early and successful eastward enlargement in which 2002 will be crucial.
We will judge your presidency primarily by your achievements in preparing the reunification of our continent.
We wish you success, too, in your efforts to guide smoothly the introduction of the euro.
As one who saw in the New Year in France, I am particularly grateful for Spain's role in lending Chirac and Jospin a little small change.
Perhaps next time you see Tony Blair you will hand him a few coins as well and ask him whether his indecision is final.
British entry into the euro would certainly mean the kind of More Europe we would like to see.
Your vision of the future speaks of new transnational challenges.
Relations between India and Pakistan are deeply worrying but Afghanistan must be uppermost in our minds.
Soon the bombing must stop and the building must begin.
We must respond to the plight of the people through generous giving from our aid budget and more help in patrolling the peace.
Your programme speaks of a war against terrorism.
This is no conventional war and it will not be won with conventional weapons.
Some of us fear that military intelligence, which is leading to bombing and military solutions, may be causing collateral damage and storing up other problems for the future.
We hope that Europe can offset this collateral damage by adding to our armoury emotional intelligence, recognising that political problems often require political solutions.
You kindly referred to my report on terrorism, adopted on 6 September last year.
I would draw your attention, too, to our resolution on cooperation between the United States and the European Union in the fight against terrorism.
Liberal Democrats view with deep unease the divergence between the US approach of emergency laws and military tribunals and the rights-based approach that we want for the Union.
We insist that you can be both tough on terrorism and true to our Treaties.
(Applause)You will take forward the building of the area of freedom, security and justice defined in the Amsterdam Treaty.
Your presidency programme asserts that current exceptional circumstances require putting security first.
If this is true we will nonetheless push you to make sure that freedom and justice are not far behind.
In drafting a programme like this any presidency faces a dilemma.
We recognise that.
A list of priorities soon becomes a universal catalogue.
Each Member State brings something different to the party.
While we welcome the input that Spain can make to the Barcelona Process and Euro-Med, we are nonetheless fascinated to read in your programme that the European Union's northern dimension is one of your priorities.
We will follow development in this matter closely.
The reform of the Council that you talk about is most welcome.
We hope that you will ensure that the Council abides by its undertaking to allow public access to documents and that it seeks better relations with this House, which, sadly, does not get a mention in your programme until page 20.
This House is the true democratic forum of our continent and we want to see its rights respected.
If for my Group something is missing in this document it is a recognition of Europe's different regions and cultures.
It reads to me as a rather Castilian programme that does not reflect entirely the Spain which I have visited and the Spain that is represented in my Group.
What has become of the work of the eminent Director-General in the Commission, Mr Eneko Landaburu?
Your second definition of More Europe talks about 'signifying the European nature of Spanish society.'
Our second definition of More Europe would be that it signifies the contribution of all Iberian cultures and the flowering thereof among other European cultures in the creation of a Europe whose strength is not that of a monolithic state with deciduous development, but one of unity through diversity.
In wishing you every success, Prime Minister, I look forward to a vigorous debate with the Spanish Presidency.
(Applause)
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, first of all, I would like to welcome you to this House.
We hope that you enjoy these six months and also that cooperation with the European Parliament continues to be as positive and open as it was during the Belgian Presidency.
In a constructive spirit, I would just like, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to express certain doubts and criticisms that we have concerning the focus of the programme you have just presented.
Setting the objective of 'more Europe' does not necessarily mean wanting a better Europe in the sense of creating a Europe of more democracy, openness and solidarity.
The Spanish Presidency has decided to focus very strongly on combating terrorism. This is certainly a legitimate reflection of Spain' s national policy of eliminating ETA violence once and for all.
However, it would appear important to emphasise that it is neither acceptable nor effective to imagine that terrorist violence can be curbed by reducing the significance of some of the most important victories of the European democracies and the Union such as respect for individual freedoms, citizens' equality before the law and parliamentary control at European as well as national level of all decisions on this matter.
We would certainly have been much happier if you had shown your intention to uphold these concepts more clearly.
Moreover, it is a matter of no small concern that the Spanish government is concentrating on cooperation with the United States without, at the same time, distancing the Union from those decisions of the US administration which place it outside the rule of law and which could lead to a militarisation of the legal system.
Similarly, talking about an international anti-terrorism alliance but remaining silent on the way the Russian government is continuing to terrorise and destroy Chechnya does nothing for the European Union' s credibility.
(Applause) Secondly, Mr President-in-Office, your government' s programme includes a list of themes, but it does not clearly define the political vision for European integration.
Further evidence of this is the fact that the only task you are entrusting to the Convention, which will start work in two months' time, is the preparation of tangible, realistic options to submit to the 2004 Conference.
Yet, as you are quite aware, this Convention is the product of the failure of Nice, and its success will be measured in terms of its ability to constitute a break with the intergovernmental method of reforming the Union and to involve representatives of the people and civil society in the process of European integration.
It is my fervent hope that the Spanish Presidency will support this innovative experiment and accept calmly that we have reached the stage where it is no longer just the States but the citizens and their representatives at European, national and regional levels as well - at regional level too - who can and must be involved in shaping the future of the European Union.
On the subject of shared values, I would like to ask you not to underestimate the European dimension of what has been happening in my native country, Italy, where the principle of the separation of powers is constantly being challenged and where there is still a problem with the concentration of media power combined with an unresolved conflict of interests.
Thirdly, we are greatly concerned at the cursory treatment in your programme of the issue of sustainable development and the urgent need to respond with practical, incisive action to the environmental challenges facing us.
It would appear that this cursory treatment is a direct result of an antiquated idea that the priorities of economic growth and safeguarding the environment and quality of life are still conflicting.
In fact, the opposite is true.
However, and I cannot stress this enough, the environmental constraints governing the economic, social and fiscal policies of the Union and its Member States continue to be inadequate.
In this connection, I would very briefly like to give you two negative examples, which directly concern Spain.
The first is the national hydrological plan, against which there is strong opposition in your country, Mr Aznar: 400 000 people protesting in Madrid and 10 000 in Brussels, as well as 25 000 individual complaints to the Commission cannot be ignored, and we will make this matter a priority in our work.
We do not accept the claim that the hydrological plan is purely a Spanish affair, not just because the Spanish government wants EUR 8 billion from the Structural Funds to be spent on financing part of it but because, if it were to be implemented, it would violate European legislation on nature conservation and the safeguarding of water resources and would lead to a distortion of competition in the agricultural sector. Also, finally, because the real purpose of the plan is to transfer water resources from poor regions to wealthy regions in order to serve water-intensive farming and tourism development.
This is a recipe for disaster, which has already caused havoc that we cannot allow to be repeated.
I have other things to say to you, Mr President-in-Office, regarding the liberalisation of the electricity market, but I will save them for another time.
In any case, I wish you a successful six month' s work.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency has come at a time of international difficulty and it must therefore deal with highly topical issues.
In order to deal with these issues, as you said, Mr Aznar, we will need 'more Europe' .
The introduction of the euro has created a new reality.
The most important task, Mr Aznar, is to supplement the euro in the economic and social fields.
You have expressed your intention to carry out what you call new economic reforms.
In the language of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, this means promoting the social aspects of European integration in a decisive manner and strengthening economic and social cohesion.
We believe that Europe is not going to improve its economic cohesion and development by means of policies of liberalisation and privatisation, by means of employment deregulation which endangers jobs and by reducing levels of social protection and by tax reforms which make fiscal systems less sufficient and less progressive.
Furthermore, Mr Aznar, the international economic situation demands imagination and flexibility.
We believe that we should not confront it shackled by a rigorous and excessively restrictive notion of the stability pact.
The fact that the world economy is now close to recession is beyond question, Mr Aznar.
The European Union needs political impetus and democratisation of its economic decision-making.
We need budgets geared towards employment and economic and social cohesion.
The stability pact must be made more flexible and at least preserve public investment when there are excessive deficits, and this is an expenditure which is an essential element for the future development of the Union and also, in the short term, an element which will increase and stimulate economic activity.
It is essential to supplement the single currency with a process of harmonisation in the fiscal, employment and social fields, building a genuine economic policy - not just monetary - and making decisive progress towards a social Europe.
Lastly, Mr Aznar, it worries us that there is no attempt to strengthen public services, which would reflect a social view of European integration.
Many fashionable reforms in our countries put an end to public monopolies in strategic sectors, only to convert them in many cases into private oligopolies, which makes them difficult to control publicly and which does not lead to any real increase in efficiency.
I could cite various examples in different countries concerning rail transport, health systems or electrical supplies.
Therefore, Mr Aznar, in summary, we believe that the Barcelona Summit should reflect this type of concern and adopt a much more dynamic and stronger view of European social integration.
You will recognise, as I do, that, on this issue, I am obviously expressing the existing differences, as you know, between our different political forces.
Of course, Mr Aznar, the negotiations on the bases of the enlargement agreement - as the Spanish Presidency has said, and I agree with it - must be concluded during this six-month period. Otherwise, enlargement will not be possible in 2004.
In this regard, Mr Aznar, I would like to make the following comment: a Union of 27 States - with enlargement to a further 10 States - will increase the surface area of the European Union by 34%, it will increase the population by more than 28%, but the Community income will increase by barely 5%.
Do we really appreciate the political challenge posed by enlargement?
Do we really appreciate the degree to which social problems may be exacerbated as a result of enlargement?
In the current European Union, 16% of the population have a per capita income which is 90% lower than the Community average, and in the Union of 27 States, for example, this proportion would rise to 34%.
We therefore believe that for the first time, unlike what happened with the so-called Delors packages, where in successive enlargements of the area of the internal market there were firm commitments in relation to decisive increases in economic and social cohesion, we are now in a situation in which economic and social cohesion - as was expressed in the Delors packages - must be thoroughly strengthened and increased.
We would therefore like an unequivocal signal in this regard.
It is possible that the agricultural negotiation will end with the implementation of a transitional period that will go beyond the deadline of 2006.
The problem will be what to do next.
Agriculture, like any economic activity, requires prospects and the negotiation should be accompanied by clear signals on the future of the agricultural policy, where we will surely hear requests from some people for the dismantling of common policies for the sake of budgetary savings.
Others believe that the common policies should not be dismantled, but rather strengthened in certain areas, such as food safety and environmental concerns, which should be incorporated into all our Community policies.
The question of the structural funds brings into focus - as I said in relation to the Delors packages - the future political shape of the European Union.
A larger European Union will require greater efforts to increase economic and social cohesion between the regions.
Mr Aznar, we must construct an area of freedom, justice and security for the citizens, while fully respecting the democratic traditions of our countries and the fundamental human rights embodied in our Charter.
There is no place for terrorism in this area.
Terrorism is our enemy, but neither should there be room for repressive laws or measures which bear no relation to this fight and which contribute to reducing the legal and judicial guarantees of our citizens.
The construction of this area of freedom must also be an opportunity to achieve a very high degree of harmonisation of legal guarantees.
In the field of foreign, security and defence policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am going to make a few very specific comments in order to be brief.
The Spanish Presidency has the responsibility to ensure that the European Union and the European Parliament, in cooperation with the Spanish Presidency, take a decisive step in terms of seeking a just solution in the Middle East.
We believe that we should make it very clear that the decisions of the United Nations and of international law should be respected and that Israel' s illegal and military occupation of the Palestinian State should cease.
We should welcome the intention to continue improving the Barcelona process, which is currently in stalemate.
A genuine regional integration of the countries on the Southern shores of the Mediterranean is necessary.
The development of the region cannot be based solely on the aid and commercial concessions provided by the European Union, established individually with each of the Mediterranean countries.
More Europe means playing our proper role in regional stabilisation and promoting the economic development of our neighbouring areas.
Accordingly, the initiative of creating the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank seems to us to be a positive one.
But, while perhaps complicating the issue, Mr Aznar, the Morocco-Sahara conflict must be resolved through the calling of the referendum on self-determination, as agreed in the United Nations.
We believe that the position taken by the Spanish Government on this problem, in accordance with Spain' s responsibility towards the Saharan people and international law, is commendable.
The Spanish Presidency should direct its greatest efforts towards Central America, particularly at this crucial time, with the acute crisis in Colombia and the collapse of the Argentine economy.
The European Parliament unanimously supported the negotiated solution to the long conflict suffered by Colombia, disassociating itself from the militarisation of the United States' proposal, the Colombia Plan.
In these tragic times, the authoritative voice of the European Union may be decisive in terms of consolidating talks between the government and the guerrilla movement.
We hope, Mr Aznar, that you will act accordingly.
The Belgian Presidency has taken significant steps in normalising relations with Cuba, by beginning to overcome the so-called common position, which is more suited to the Cold War than to present times.
Mr Aznar, my political group has strongly supported the Convention.
We would have liked the participation in it to be more pluralist, but in any event, we are convinced of its importance.
The Spanish Presidency has said that the issues dealt with by the Convention must be very open and that its agreements and conclusions should inform the future decisions of the Intergovernmental Conference and the Treaty of 2004.
Mr Aznar, you will note that I have described a landscape of positive and negative positions.
You can count on the cooperation of the humble group I represent within my political group on all those positive issues.
Mr President, in setting out the presidency's programme with regard to key policy issues, which will be addressed over the next six months by the European Union, the Spanish Prime Minister has stated that his priority of priorities during Spain's six-months' presidency of the EU will be the global fight against terrorism.
I strongly support this political objective.
The European Union has certainly adopted a series of measures to combat international terrorism in recent months as an immediate response to the horrific terrorist attacks in the United States last September.
The prevention of the use of the European financial system as a money-laundering route for terrorism must continue to be a priority for our Union.
The fifteen governments of the Union should also be in a position to freeze the assets of terrorists and those involved in organised and international crime.
I very much welcome the Spanish Government's objective of promoting more police cooperation across the borders of the Union.
This is very important because intelligence agencies within the Union, together with Europol, have to work much more closely together in terms of exchanging and sharing information if the terror networks operating in Europe are to be broken.
The enlargement negotiations with the applicant countries will be entering a new phase during the Spanish Presidency.
This presidency is being entrusted with two very difficult chapters in the negotiations on enlargement, namely agricultural policy and regional aid.
The Union and the applicant countries must sit down and hammer out an agreement on the difficult chapters of the discussions because otherwise enlargement of the Union cannot take place quickly and will not be a success.
Countries in Eastern and Central Europe are presently receiving EU Structural Funds so as to make their economies more competitive.
This is an important policy objective because it will ensure that on entry these countries can participate within the Union in a competitive climate.
If the economies of Eastern and Central Europe are not competitive, then they will not be able to participate within the internal market in any real, effective sense.
Equally, promoting market economies in Eastern and Central Europe is good news for businesses within the Union, which can also expand their goods and services into new markets.
The Spanish Government is also going to set up the Convention in March this year to look at the development of the future of EU policies within the Union in the context of the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2004.
It is important that the terms of reference of this Convention are clear and decisive and that its conclusions in due course do not turn out to be an unattainable wish list.
Amendments to the Treaties have to be agreed by European Union leaders and any proposals emanating from this Convention must be balanced, progressive and achievable.
I also welcome the commitment of the Spanish Government to promote the implementation of EU regulations and directives, which should expand the use of new information technologies into all parts of the Union.
This is exceptionally important if the Union is to remain competitive in the years to come.
Finally, one of the great disappointments of Laeken was the failure to reach agreement on the siting of up to 12 new important EU agencies.
I hope that the Spanish Government can reach agreement quickly on the location of these important agencies, in particular the European Food Authority and the European Maritime Safety Agency.
Mr President, the smallest group in Parliament, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, also wishes to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Aznar, and we should like to talk a little about the Convention, which will begin on 1 March.
It will have a very unevenly balanced membership of 105 people and a 14-member praesidium which also looks as if it will be very unevenly balanced.
I would call upon you to ensure that these 14 members also include representatives of the 49% who voted 'no' in the referendum on Maastricht in France and of the near enough 50% who voted 'no' in a couple of referendums in Denmark.
I think it very inappropriate to put together a praesidium of 14 representatives who think alike and who will produce a result which, after three or four years, then ends up being overturned in a referendum.
It would be more practical to secure a lasting compromise by entering into dialogue straight away with the different points of view to be found among the various populations.
The intergroup here in Parliament, which is called 'SOS Democracy' and whose members are in a way the federalists' polar opposites, as well as partners cooperating on issues of transparency and proximity to the people, has had an excellent meeting with Mr Verhofstadt and also wishes to request a corresponding meeting with yourself.
During the meeting with Mr Verhofstadt, the latter made two interesting pledges.
Firstly, he called for all the delegations from all the countries to include those we call Eurorealists and urged that, for example, at least one of the three representatives - two from the national parliament and one from the government - from two of the countries should be someone with a Eurorealist approach.
He pledged that he would work towards these goals and called upon us to campaign for them.
His second pledge was that he would support a subsequent referendum.
My question to Mr Aznar is as to whether he too would call for broad representation and ensure that referendums subsequently take place.
Will he be involved in ensuring that two different drafts are prepared: a constitution for a democratic federal state, and a democratic agreement between independent countries, so that people can see the difference?
Will he be a party to holding a consultative referendum on two different proposals?
Will be involved in asking people what they think and have an intergovernmental conference called for the purpose of preparing a compromise?
We must discuss how the Charter can bind the institutions together without coming into conflict with the constitutions and the European Court of Human Rights; how a division of the Treaty into two parts will not simply make it less likely that there will be referendums in the event of Treaty changes; how more than thirty forms of decision can be reduced to three clear forms of decision; how we are to formulate a right of veto on crucial issues without paralysing the whole process; how the national parliaments are to be associated with the cooperation process and whether they can assume the Commission' s initiative, monopoly and competence catalogue; and how it can be ensured that matters do not just go the same way as did the rule of law.
In connection with the issue of openness, which Mr Watson also addressed, I should like finally to ask you, Mr Aznar, whether you will change Spain' s position and ensure that Parliament receives the same documentation as the Council of Ministers.
As a friend of Spain, I particularly welcome you to Parliament, and I hope that you will surprise us by implementing that openness which Sweden did not get anywhere with and which Belgium did not work to bring about.
Bienvenido.
Thank you Mr President.
(The speaker continued in the Basque language) Urte berri on danori eta zuri zorionak Lehendakari Jauna.
Mr President, Happy New Year to everybody and congratulations to our President.
Yesterday Mr Poettering mentioned the relevance of you being Irish as the best evidence of political success for the small countries of our continent.
As a Basque, I was very pleased to hear that, because the Republic of Ireland, which has only existed for a century, can give a European stateless nation like ours a very encouraging example.
For that reason too, I wish you good luck and all the best.
During the coming months, however, the Government of the Kingdom of Spain will be at your side watching how faithfully you are following the path marked out by your predecessor.
Let me recall that in 1999 the refusal of the Spanish Government to move from its nationalist blindness threw away the greatest chance for peace in more than a generation.
Prime Minister, can you give this Parliament a glimmer of hope by saying that you will be committed to working towards a political settlement of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country?
Time is running out.
At the end of this week you will have 10% less time left in the term of your European Union presidency.
You must hurry up.
We are ready for an immediate breakthrough in the present deadlock.
I will finish by recalling the words of Mr Watson. He said that it is necessary to recognise that "political problems often require political solutions".
As we are running behind time, thanks to the capacity of some of the group chairmen to express themselves, I will show a less liberal disposition for the balance of the morning.
Mr President, I hope that you will not start shortening my speaking time.
I believe that the debate we are holding today clearly demonstrates that we are at a decisive point in terms of European integration.
And I therefore believe that the ambitiousness of the Spanish Presidency' s objectives - any one of them could be described as historic - quite rightly reflects this fact.
The truth is that the decisiveness, or even enthusiasm, with which 300 million European citizens have taken on board the euro, suggests that we can look to the future with optimism.
The European Parliament, as an expression of popular will, must now demonstrate its ability to play its role of providing the debate with impetus, a role which has particularly been recognised over the last six months of the Belgian Presidency and as the Spanish Prime Minister has stressed this morning.
We have provided the Commission and the Council with inspiration, for example, in order to provide the justice systems of the Member States with Community instruments which make the defence of freedoms in the face of terrorism more effective.
Since the beginning of this legislature, it has been made clear in this House, more than in any other place, that terrorism is a problem and a threat to everybody, and not only to the direct victims.
Therefore, the fact that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said that it is necessary to improve the codecision procedure in the next reform of the Union Treaty is an acknowledgement that we should be grateful for.
We are going to deal with this reform by means of the method which was used to draw up the Charter of Fundamental Rights - which my Group hopes will be incorporated into the new Treaty - that is to say, by means of a Convention which will be inaugurated in March in the headquarters of Parliament, as has been revealed to us this morning.
We trust that that positive attitude from the Council will be maintained throughout the work of the Convention, so that we can respond to two needs: firstly, to bring the Community institutions closer to the citizens by making them more democratic, more efficient and more transparent; and secondly, by undertaking a profound reform of an institutional framework designed for the six founding States, adapting it to a reality in which there are 25 or more Member States, which we hope to see in 2004.
Ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations for the enlargement of the European Union - some of the most important chapters of which, as has been said, will be dealt with in the coming months - should not in any way become polluted by domestic debates.
On the contrary, in the current Member States, government and opposition should leave aside party-political confrontation in the face of this great Union objective.
Mr BarÃ³n, we must bear in mind that the success of a Presidency is not measured in national terms, or much less party-political terms.
This morning you recognised that you need to take a few classes.
I fear that you do not only need computing classes.
You spoke like a Spanish Socialist.
I trust that you will show the same loyalty that the European Popular Party showed to the two previous Presidencies.
(Protests from the PSE Group) Mr President, we must use these six months to make the European Union stronger in the world, participating in international debates by means of the common position.
To this end, it is not just necessary to move ahead with the institutional reforms of the CFSP in order to make it more efficient and visible inside and outside our borders, but we must also improve the instruments which the European Union already has, such as the Community external service.
There is no doubt that numerous challenges await us over the next six months, which will demand effort and cooperation from all of us: citizens, European institutions, governments and political parties.
We fully trust that this Presidency will represent a step towards a larger and more united Europe, which is more open to the world and closer to the citizens.
Mr President, holding a Presidency is always an opportunity for a country to demonstrate its commitment to a common cause which is no less than moving European integration forward in a way that benefits the citizens.
Mr Aznar, I know that you have a difficult job, that the international context, in political and economic terms, is complicated and furthermore, as has been said, that the Belgian Presidency has set a very high standard.
But have no doubt, Mr President, that the Spanish Socialists will cooperate unreservedly in making the Presidency a success for Spain and for Europe.
There will never ever be disloyalty from our side.
Others may show some.
We hope that you do it well, because we want this Presidency to give Spain prestige within Europe.
Therefore, Mr President, your personal effort and that of the members of your government will have to rise to the occasion.
Mr President, in your communication you have listed Europe' s current priorities.
Enlargement, the Lisbon process, the international coalition for freedoms and against terrorism, the single area of security and justice, the external policy, relations with the Mediterranean countries, the role of Europe in Latin America: that is your agenda, Mr President.
But we Socialists would have liked to hear you make some specific commitment, an ambitious initiative relating to some of these issues.
For example, we would have liked it if, when talking about the Lisbon process, you had stressed the social aspects.
Because the Lisbon process agreed a strategic objective which, together with the construction of a more prosperous and competitive economic area, included the objectives of full employment and greater cohesion.
Please commit yourself, Mr President, to making all the coordination methods relating to these social agenda strategies increasingly Community methods.
Associate the European Parliament, the unions and employers with this process.
In our view, this would mean more Europe.
I will give another example: the Mediterranean and Latin America are European priorities, but a good Spanish Presidency, given its special closeness and relations with these two regions, should be able to put the emphasis on them.
Nevertheless, we do not notice in your programme concrete initiatives to revitalise dialogue and cooperation beyond the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, which by the way was foreseen in 1995 in Barcelona and later in Laeken.
You do not tell us how or when you are going to conclude the negotiations with Mercosur and with Chile.
We note the lack of concrete commitments.
Mr President, we are glad that you have chosen the motto 'More Europe' , and not because it is a classic of the Socialist family.
I will tell you now that we will not judge you by the number of meetings you hold in six months, but we will judge you on the results.
So you must move on from words to actions, Mr President.
What do you mean by more Europe?
I imagine that it will not be, as Minister PiquÃ© said, that Europe should speak with a single voice in 2050, because, as country folk would say, 'that is a journey that requires no saddlebags' .
I am truly impressed by the ambition of the Minister for External Affairs.
More Europe means more security, but also more freedom.
More Europe means more employment but also less inequality.
More Europe means more democracy and more participation.
More Europe also means a Europe that is more active in the defence of human rights.
More Europe, in summary, also means less nationalism, of either the old type or the new type.
Mr President, if you act in this way, we will be the first to applaud you.
We want you to be successful and we want to celebrate your success together.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to stress the support of the Liberal Group and of my party, ConvergÃšncia DemocrÃ tica de Catalunya, in order to ensure that this Presidency ends with a positive assessment, with distinction, which will include it in the category of the two previous Spanish Presidencies.
Of the issues mentioned as priorities for the present Presidency, I would like to stress the following three.
That the meeting of the Barcelona European Council, in March, provides concrete commitments and results which can be confirmed, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the structural reforms and liberalisation processes necessary for complying with the objectives set in the process initiated at the Lisbon Council.
That the Euro-Mediterranean Council serves to promote a new stage in the process begun, also under a Spanish Presidency, in Barcelona in 1995, in order to ensure greater and better cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean.
We are in favour of the creation of a financial institution which allows the full and effective application of the funds agreed for the Mediterranean programmes.
We must intensify the Union' s external policy, in which much of its future peace and stability is at stake.
In your key role as a member of the Praesidium of the Convention, we ask that you ensure the incorporation and participation of the constitutional regions in the institutions of the European Union in the constituent text to be agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference of 2004.
As the chairman of the Liberal Group stressed in his speech, the European Union cannot be considered complete unless it includes the full participation and integration of the Europe of the Regions.
It is an issue to which, under the Spanish Presidency, which will begin with the Convention, we attach the greatest importance, as has been stressed.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain will endow the Presidency of the European Union with a proposed set of priorities which shows ambition and will.
European integration today means strengthening freedoms, isolating intolerance and making that integration compatible with the necessary fight against terrorism.
The priority given by Spain to enlargement is not accompanied by the necessary commitments to guarantee the legitimate objectives of the Objective 1 territories.
Vital to me, as a supporter of Andalusian autonomy, in order to safeguard the future, are the reform of the common agricultural policy, the debate on rural development, codecision in agriculture and food safety, in order to prevent extremely costly crises and alarm amongst consumers.
The presence of the autonomous communities in the Council when issues relating to our interests and competences are dealt with will always be positive and enriching.
Reflect the reality of Spain in Europe.
Do not try to hide it, Mr Aznar.
The autonomous communities are also States.
A plural Spain in a plural Europe, creating more Union.
Take that political and social reality further.
Mr Aznar, you have not explicitly mentioned Morocco in your speech.
Include it in your Presidency.
Mr Aznar, please do not let the neutrality of the Presidency paralyse our legitimate Europeanist objective of cohesion.
Let us be firm, but let us also talk.
Mr President, it is a shame that, yet again, some of the left-wing Members have adopted a presumptuous, party-political position of opposition to Italy, to a people, that is, who elected their government freely and democratically, with regard to the development of the future and present European Union.
Moreover, such trifling issues do not deserve Parliament' s attention.
Mr Aznar, the Spanish Presidency' s programme is full of issues to be addressed and objectives, and underlying all the initiatives we can see the commitment to restoring politics to its central place in the debate.
Time constraints prevent us from mentioning more than just a few points.
Firstly, the common economic policy that you have tackled, which the President-designate of the Commission has pinpointed as key for the future and which confirms the view we expressed in voting for the euro in Brussels: there can be no monetary policy without a strong common economic policy.
Secondly, the Mediterranean policy, whose progress must be speeded up because, although cooperation between the intelligence services of the European countries is extremely important to combat terrorism - as we have stressed in the debate on that subject - it is equally true that we need to combat poverty, to restore peace to the Middle East, to re-centre the European Union politically: therefore, we need an incisive Mediterranean policy to be a key part of the forthcoming Barcelona Summit.
Thirdly, implementing the concept of More Europe, or More Europe of the Citizens practically, which means we need institutions which are less bureaucratic and more democratic, and we need greater respect for traditions, for the identities of the individual countries, for a Europe which is not just a standardisation machine but generates growth for each country, as the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, said yesterday.
Then we must not forget the Argentinian disaster: the one hundred and twentieth crisis in Argentina since 1975.
We therefore also need to address the issue of the speculation bubble, the excessive disparity between the actual economy and - indeed - the official economy; we must tackle the Argentinian problem by providing aid immediately, not least because of the ties of friendship and tradition our countries have with Argentina.
Mr President, it is a matter of some regret that Spain, a great country that France and the French people hold very dear, has chosen the theme of 'More Europe' . This theme does not break any new ground, as it has, after all, been compulsory for almost fifty years, and it cannot fail to cause us concern because 'More Europe' equates to nothing more than the constantly increasing destruction of what makes up the substance of Europe, namely the nations.
To some extent, however, Spain will not break any new ground.
You are not breaking new ground, in particular, in the area that you have made your priority as a head of government, Mr Aznar; in other words, the fight against terrorism.
There is something risible about combating terrorism when you appear to be doing everything possible to encourage its growth, both at a superficial and deeper level, in Europe and everywhere else in the world.
An obvious example of its superficial growth is the ridiculous and criminal obsession with bringing down borders, which of course does not fail to make police controls increasingly difficult and which, above all, encourages internationalism which has always been the greatest weapon of all forms of terrorism since time immemorial.
At a deeper level, bringing down borders destroys people' s sense of national belonging, which for centuries has given them a reference point in space and time, and, in other words, a place in history.
They thus rediscover their ethnic origins and begin to fight against what remains of the nation State, a fight that we also encourage on occasion.
Thus, what is happening in Spain is what happens everywhere else.
In our view, we can only combat Basque terrorism by asserting a broad Spanish policy on the international stage, a policy which, fortunately, Spain also has the resources to conduct in Europe, in the Mediterranean and in Latin America.
However, Europe does not allow us to be self-assertive.
At a deeper level still, terrorism is both favoured and encouraged by the deep disorder into which the world is plunging under the battering that the nations are suffering as a result of the sacrosanct dogma of capitalism that is trade liberalisation.
This does not only lead to the destruction of the national sense of belonging, which is also one of the sources of Islamic terrorism, but also to the building, on the misleading pretext of globalisation, of a real wall between the rich world and poor world, which has no future and is therefore in the most dire straits.
From this point of view, it is fortunately encouraging that the nations are showing signs of rebelling, particularly the nations in Europe. Italy and Germany are giving us some positive signs, Denmark and Ireland have already done so, and I am sure that France will too in the days to come.
Mr Aznar, this could be your main worry in the coming six months.
And if you have made a conscious choice to deny what is really happening at national level, I cannot, we cannot, wish you good luck.
Mr President-in-Office, congratulations and the best of luck for your term of office.
The programme you have presented for your Presidency is extremely dense.
I would like, if I may, to put forward a few suggestions which would make it a great, ambitious programme as well.
I belong to a political family which, unlike many others, has always believed that the only things of any importance are ideas and a vision for the future.
Well then, under your Presidency, an old idea we extremists have had for many years regarding law and international law can come to fruition.
During your Presidency, you can complete the establishment, for the sake of humanity, of the permanent international court which will bring to justice those accused of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity.
It will be an historic moment, a fundamental change, which, together with the Treaties, will introduce an initial element of international jurisdiction.
Sixty ratifications are needed and over 50 have been obtained.
Many of our friendly neighbours are far advanced in the process.
It is possible, if you want it, and we will all help you - Parliament is going to discuss the issue in February - for the Spanish Presidency to obtain the necessary 60 ratifications in the name and on behalf of 200 million European citizens.
I hope that you will embrace this as a historic opportunity for change.
Think how different it would be, even where the fight against terrorism is concerned if - as in the case with Slobodan Milosevic, who is a mere war criminal awaiting trial - today, we had the chance to send the Osama Bin Ladens or the Mullah Omars of this world for trial before a permanent international court. Then our American friends would not find themselves having to invent military courts and the like.
Well then, we and you yourself have the chance to achieve this, and we are certainly determined to do so.
Of course, Mr Aznar, we fully support the fight against terrorism, but what concerns me is the political response, for clearly, military and judicial responses are not sufficient.
We continue to follow and implement the principle that the enemy of my enemy is automatically my friend.
We are in danger of heedlessly accepting the most unlikely regimes as allies because we need them.
Some of these regimes, Mr President, are close by; they may even lie on the southern shore of the Mediterranean.
There is another point I would like to make.
You see, I feel that we are sitting next to a minefield and that a new vision of our relations with the Mediterranean must be the priority for our present and certainly for our immediate future.
These are just a few suggestions, Mr President, but they would help us to be forward-looking in a practical way, which is precisely what our citizens want us to be.
Mr President, firstly I would like to wish the Spanish Presidency luck for the ambitious programme they have presented here this morning.
The speeches by certain Members have reminded me of what Marx said, not Karl but Groucho, about certain literary critics who were so busy writing criticism that they never had five minutes to sit down and read a novel.
Mr President, I would like to say that the Spanish Presidency has a series of objectives which are being presented straight away, both in terms of the internal dimension of the project and of its external dimension.
It is clearly a question of uniting wills, forging consensus and identifying the right direction so that the European Union can make progress.
This will require two things.
It requires a method, and at Laeken the Convention method was chosen, which is an innovative method: Europe cannot be built on the basis of concentric circles.
And it requires ambition.
I do not agree with what my good friend Mr Watson said, though I congratulate him on his appointment as chairman of the Liberal Group, because I believe that Spain is very well placed to contribute to overcoming one of the historic challenges of our times, which is how to reconcile unity with diversity prudently and judiciously.
How to provide the European Union project with a well-tuned orchestra, well-tempered, as Mozart said, which is guided by democratic impulses and not by a blast of a bugle like a battalion.
Mr President, when freedom was savagely attacked by the barbarity of 11 September, it immediately became clear that notions of security, defence, cooperation, external policy and development aid are interrelated and must be based on a common awareness that the threats and dangers of terrorism affect all of us alike and that we must therefore respond to them as one.
Mr President, I would like to say a couple of things about Latin America.
This Parliament thinks that Latin America does not need gifts, but rather opportunities.
But we also believe that we sometimes have to move on from beatitudes to accounting books and we have, therefore, significantly increased the quantities proposed by the Commission for cooperation with these regions in 2002 and we have presented an ambitious catalogue of measures aimed at giving content to that strategic objective, which the Heads of State and Government drew up at the Rio de Janeiro Summit, of creating a strategic bi-regional partnership.
Therefore, as the Presidency-in-Office has stated, we hope that the Madrid Summit will be able to send a clear and well-defined message of the Europe' s new commitment to Latin America.
I am absolutely convinced that the storey which this Presidency has to add to this Community building will be a match for the ambitious priorities they have presented to us this morning.
Mr Aznar, twenty years ago, one European market with one currency, the euro, was a dream. Today, it is a reality.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to see the same ambitions inform European security and defence policy, and all the events of 11 September have only strengthened this wish.
It is a prerequisite for peace and progress.
This is why we support the Spanish Presidency if it wishes to inject this ESDP with more dynamism, greater capacity and, in general, more resources to become more effective.
In this respect, it is essential for the message of multilateralism to be broadcast.
The US' s withdrawal from the ABM Treaty is in conflict with this.
We do not want to relapse into a fresh arms race.
We would ask the Spanish Presidency to send this European message to our ally, the United States, in particular.
We can drive this message home and make this appeal to the US with all the more force now that we, as Europe - in the coalition - are prepared vigorously to continue the fight against terrorism, both inside and outside Europe.
I have a second, serious question for the Spanish Presidency.
Are you also prepared to fight for a worldwide coalition against poverty?
After all, poverty largely forms the breeding ground for fundamentalist hatred, of whatever origin.
It must be a coalition against poverty in Asia, in Africa and also in the Euro-Mediterranean process, for security on our planet is not there for the chosen few, but is only stable if it is shared by all, under an international rule of law.
Does the Spanish Presidency not agree that it would be better to make financial investments in this instead of putting all our money unilaterally into new, Star Wars-like investments?
Against this backdrop, would you make every effort to help Messrs Solana and Patten to have a fully operational capacity for the Petersberg tasks by 2003?
In the Middle East, we hear Iran' s ex-Prime Minister, Mr Rafsanjani, threaten to destroy Israel by means of an atom bomb.
His saying that is wholly unacceptable.
But the policy of Mr Sharon, who has isolated Mr Arafat and has turned innocent Palestinian citizens into victims, has not contributed to security in Israel and Palestine in any way.
Is the Spanish Presidency, in tandem with the United States and Russia, prepared to launch a new peace initiative in the Middle East as a whole?
We would be very grateful if it did.
Mr President, Mr Aznar, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member from the Canary Islands, one of the Community' s outermost regions, and a member of the European Liberal and Democratic Reform Group, I warmly welcome the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.
Do not forget, Mr Aznar, to deal with the outstanding issues facing us in this six-month period to come, during which enlargement and the euro are presenting the European Community with a very special kind of landscape, in which the whole world is more or less affected for various reasons which oblige us to make constant, permanent and joint efforts to achieve peace and prosperity.
I must remind you that, in our European sphere, in all the pillars of the Community edifice, we have maintenance problems.
Therefore, Community policies must include something which you have pointed out: 'more Europe' .
And this is true, especially when it comes to reviewing the CAP, the Structural Funds, the consolidation of the situation of the outermost regions and creating a genuine European immigration strategy.
It is also true when it comes to institutional reforms, defining the role and the participation of the regions in the construction of the Europe of the Twenty-first Century and an appropriate environmental policy, without forgetting the fields of social policy, that is, employment and the SMEs.
Neither must you forget, in your dual capacity as President-in-Office of the Council and Spanish Prime Minister, to export more Europe to the world.
To this end, we must review the Union' s external relations - such as the Council' s common position on Cuba and the future of the Sahara, by means of a self-determination referendum - without forgetting the dialogue with our Mediterranean neighbours - from Morocco to the Middle East - or with more distant regions, such as Latin America, with the problem of Argentina, or the United States and China.
Of course you can count on our support, as always, in the joint European political fight against terrorism.
I wish you luck in this special mandate and I trust that we will all be able to celebrate together following your success in the June exams, because what is good for Europe is good for everybody, especially the outermost regions.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your priorities for the Presidency do not deal with, or at least place very much in second place, certain policies which, since they are fundamental to the Union and also for Spain and my nation, must be dealt with in 2002: the CAP, the common fisheries policy and the future of the Structural Funds.
On the contrary, you intend to use your Presidency to indulge your authoritarian obsession against European diversity, denying a presence in the Council to nationalities and regions of the Spanish States, employing a notion of sovereignty which is now anti-historical and anachronistic in the Union.
If your approach were correct, Mr Aznar, we would have to concluded that you are appearing here today as a President of a foreign institution.
We do not think like that.
I represent my nation and I am also a citizen of the Spanish State and of the Union, and there is no contradiction here.
You are mixed up in an authoritarian manner in something which is resolved in the Treaties and in practice, while ignoring the fact that in the future, if we do not deal with the problem of sovereignty, not to mention separatism, we will ask ourselves not only why Slovakia can chair a Fisheries Council while Galicia, Andalusia or the Canaries cannot attend it, but also why the historic national status of the Malta or Luxembourg is rightly recognised, while that of Galicia, the Basque country, Catalonia, Scotland, Wales or Flanders is not.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, negotiations with the candidates for accession are entering their most difficult stage yet under the Spanish Presidency.
The chapters on agriculture and regional development therefore demand the utmost sensitivity and particular prudence.
A discriminating approach is called for, especially as regards direct payments to farmers.
If we are not to be reproached for stepping up mass production to excessive levels, we must concentrate more on integrated rural policy in the accession countries rather than carrying over the system of direct payments.
Particular negotiating skill will be required in view of the background of difficulties that are manifesting themselves and the mutually opposing interests with regard to support measures.
It is indeed a matter of crucial importance that the negotiations should make capacity and sustainability possible for the future, by which I mean beyond 2004 and over and above Agenda 2000.
Prime Minister Aznar's performance this morning suggests that his presidency promises to be focused and business-like and committed to addressing the big issues.
The presidency has many tasks on the international front; carrying forward the global war on terrorism is the most difficult and the most important.
The presidency has promised to resolutely promote solidarity with the United States at this time of crisis, and it is right to do so, but other foreign problems will crowd in.
In Zimbabwe we have a growing tragedy which requires urgent EU action: smart sanctions need to be introduced immediately and a clear message sent about the dangerous consequences of the criminal path on which Mr Mugabe is currently engaged.
The presidency faces similar challenges on the economic front.
If Europe is serious about making itself the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, then Barcelona promises to be a moment of truth.
We simply cannot afford continued failure.
Europe has to get it right.
Since Stockholm things have in fact moved backwards.
The liberalising agenda has become bogged down by new social and environmental targets.
Since then we have seen at least three new EU directives which directly reduce labour market flexibility, with more in the pipeline, as well as new national laws, as in France, that tie the hands of business.
This is a job-destroying agenda.
In the target sectors for greater competition, the picture is frankly unacceptable.
In financial services - telecoms for instance - liberalisation is proceeding too slowly.
The freeing up of energy markets and postal services is way behind schedule.
If Europe really wants to emerge as the global economic leader by the end of this decade, it must show real commitment.
We need to make it easier to start and run a business and to keep and invest profits.
That means a lot of vested interests will need to be confronted.
We look to Prime Minister Aznar to lead the way.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Parliament is engaged in strenuous discussions with the Commission concerning new ways of governing - 'European governance' .
As parliamentarians we have raised objections to several proposals in the interests of effective and lively parliamentary government, but we have also found agreement with the Commission on a number of things.
Something we would both like, Mr President-in-Office, but which the Council has to date refused, is an interinstitutional working party in which we - Parliament, Commission and Council together - could discuss the issues surrounding the new way of governing.
I would ask you, Mr President-in-Office, to take care that the Council agrees to this way of proceeding together.
Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, we are of the opinion that we should in any case be treated equally with the Council, including on the issue of secondary legislation.
It is our opinion that we too should have a call back position should the secondary legislation not work well.
We take the view, moreover, that framework directives should have a sort of 'sunset clause' , a time limit.
We agree with the Commission in any case that lawmaking and the decision-making process in the European Union should again and again have their effectiveness monitored.
This also applies to the area of liberalisation, which we sometimes doubt is being carried out with a careful eye and social awareness.
Questions to be considered in this area include, for example, whether liberalisation always leads to lower prices in the long term, whether it always results in competition or sometimes also to monopolies and oligopolies, the only difference being that this time they are across Europe.
What are the chances under liberalisation for the small and medium-sized enterprises about which we are all concerned, especially in the smaller sectors?
How about the issue of concentration, especially in the media?
Italy has already been mentioned today.
We often turn a blind eye to this.
What is the net effect on employment and wages?
I mention these things not because either I or my group are opposed to liberalisation.
We mention these things because we want to carry out liberalisation in the interests of our citizens, with a careful eye and social awareness.
It may be for this reason, Mr President of the Commission and Mr President-in-Office, that some governments are sceptical about liberalisation and slow to implement it, because they feel that it does not always exactly lead to the good objective that is in mind, and because they feel that their own people do not always perceive the advantages to be found in the detail of this liberalisation strategy.
So I beg to ask you to consider, within the framework of the Barcelona and Lisbon processes, how liberalisation, which you in your programme want to push and press ahead with, can come about in our people's interest, taking the social dimensions into account as well.
The continuation of an arbitrary liberalisation strategy cannot be what it is all about.
Whilst Mr Berlusconi thinks we should strengthen Europe by being more American than the Americans, I do believe we should take our own European road to liberalisation.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have just referred to 'more Europe' and the fight against terrorism as two of your great objectives, and I share them and wish you every success.
Europe cannot be built solely by the governments of the Member States, excluding the other public institutions.
I therefore suggest we follow the examples of Germany and the previous Belgian Presidency, in which we have seen the participation of representatives of all their regions and communities.
The Spanish Government, on the other hand, repeatedly blocks any participation by the autonomous communities in the European bodies, even when the latter are going to decide on the exclusive competences of those regions, as usually happens in relation to Ecofin and financial and fiscal matters, on which the autonomous communities of the Basque Country and Navarre have full sovereignty.
In order to eradicate violence, I would cite the example of the British and Irish Governments, which sponsored the Good Friday agreements and the peace process in Ulster, and I would ask you and the Popular Party not to continue to insist on maintaining your alliance with Herri Batasuna - protectors of ETA - with the sole objective of imposing a state of political siege on the Basque Government, and instead to promote democratic dialogue with the majority of the Basque people, aimed at resolving the historic political conflict, who wish to live in peace, and to respect their right to decide their future freely.
Mr President, "More Europe" is a watchword we support, but it must be accompanied by 'More freedom' and 'More identity' .
As strong supporters of the Europe of the peoples we see as brothers - from the Basques to the Corsicans, the Flemish to the Padanians - and therefore also strong supporters of freedoms and autonomies, we identify with the project of European integration, seeing it, not least, as a response to the serious dangers of globalisation.
This motto 'More Europe' must embrace more specific commitments and actions to protect the freedoms and identities of the Europeans.
To achieve 'More Europe' , we first need undertakings to protect the diversities and specific characteristics - linguistic, regional, national and cultural - for which our peoples are fighting, particularly the people of the Po Valley.
This means taking the opposite direction to that advocated by the standardisation directives produced by the technocratic oligarchy, which has not been legitimised by any form of election, and is currently guiding and directing all the European Union' s politics.
Similarly, how could one fail to see the link between the fight against terrorism - which we support - and the dangers represented by illegal immigration, which is the breeding ground for terrorism?
There is a Council of Europe resolution which calls for immigration to be limited so as to avoid increasing or exacerbating unemployment within the States.
Why is it not invoked?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, from the point of view of foreign policy, the Spanish Presidency comes at a time when there is war between two atomic powers to be prevented, peace to be established in the Middle East, and the Barcelona process to be brought to a successful conclusion, because, if we are not successful in these areas, they may have a merciless effect on our immediate interests.
I believe, Mr President, that we can make progress on the focal points that you have mapped out.
Internationally, and nationally too, all this is tied in with the fight against terrorism, and I would like to say, in response to a speech by one of the previous speakers, that there can be no political justification for terror, which must be rejected both within the European Union and outside it.
Mr President-in-Office, I have observed over the last few months how you, astutely preparing for your presidency, have not, on foreign policy issues, fallen victim to the peril of bilateralism, which has been seen to some degree in Berlin, London and Paris.
I believe this results from the recognition that we can achieve the objectives of combating international and national terrorism and securing peace only by a joint effort and not on the basis of everyone for himself, and that it is for this reason that we must bring about a common foreign and security policy.
I am thankful that you evidently are able to go down this road.
There are yet two more reasons why your presidency comes at a decisive moment.
You will, when the Convention begins, be able to emphasise certain features of what the internal configuration of the European Union will be like in the future.
We therefore ask you for the support that will give the Convention the working facilities it needs in order to be able to meet these requirements.
Your presidency will, though, also see the preparatory decisions on enlargement of the European Union taken, that is to say, on the outward configuration of the European Union in the future.
We hope for very close cooperation with you on these issues over the next six months.
Mr President, in Laeken, two decisions were taken which are very important to the creation of a European judicial area in the fight against terrorism: a common definition and sanctions in relation to terrorism and the European arrest warrant.
This Parliament had insisted on these two measures in the Watson report - and I would like to congratulate him on his election and also on his words - and I believe we have done a positive job with the Council and the Commission in implementing it.
In Laeken, an assessment was also made of the implementation of the Tampere agenda.
I will return to that in a moment.
But I would also like to say that on 27 December, COREPER adopted a series of decisions relating to the fight against terrorism.
The decision allowing for a list of people and organisations active in the European Union is significant.
Article 4 of the common position stating the need for the police and judicial cooperation laid down in the Treaty and in the international agreements in this field will be applied to them.
We are delighted with this decision, which is of unquestionable symbolic value.
We hope that the measures for combating the funding of terrorism in Europe can also be applied soon.
And I also hope, Mr President, that the Council will maintain the excellent cooperation that it has enjoyed with this Parliament, with the exception of recent times.
Having adopted the most important instruments for fighting terrorism, we must now see that they are applied.
You can and must convince the States which have the most doubts.
I would also like to point out a cause for concern in relation to the question of immigration.
Your agenda mentions immigration for humanitarian reasons and the fight against illegal immigration.
You miss out an important package: that of rights and duties and that of the organisation of the legal entry of persons.
And there are already documents in the Commission in this regard.
Please promote the whole agenda, so that we do not have to end up regretting unfulfilled decisions, as happened in Laeken with certain decisions taken in Tampere.
Senyor President Aznar, the theme you have given your presidency is 'MÃ¡s Europa' [More Europe].
'MÃ¡s Europa' also implies that Catalan, a language spoken by almost 10 million Europeans, can be established in this House. This is enshrined in the Charter on Fundamental Rights and is part of our cultural diversity.
'MÃ¡s Europa' also means that our Ministers can be directly involved in the European decisions that concern them, as defined in the Treaty of Maastricht.
'MÃ¡s Europa' also implies that the State must not commit the ecological crime of the national hydrological plan, as stipulated in the European habitat and water directives.
'MÃ¡s Europa' also means enabling all nations, if they wish, to become full members of the Union; this is contained in several European Parliament resolutions acknowledging the right to self-determination.
President Aznar, my party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, the Republican Left of Catalonia, and I know that we cannot count on you to make all these democratic advances.
Mr President, when I look at the stars on our flag, I see old and young nations rising up in the four corners of Europe.
They all wish to take their place, their rightful place in this common Chamber.
Allow me to finish in Catalan...
...
Visca Catalunya lliure! [Long live a free Catalonia!]
Visca Europa unida! [Long live a united Europe!]
Mr President, on seeing the stars on the European flag, I believe that some people have mistaken our forum and have come here to make narrow-minded statements.
I am not going to get involved in that debate because this is a place for talking about Europe.
And we have come here to discuss a programme that combines ambition with vision.
I am therefore very pleased, Mr President, that we are dealing here with a six-month programme during which, as most Members have pointed out, much is going to be done and many initiatives are going to be taken.
It is true that the tradition of Parliament is to demand that the Presidency-in-Office get things done.
But I also believe that, in compensation for the many things that have been demanded today, this Parliament must make a commitment to doing something which seems to me extraordinarily important: the Barcelona process is going to be a key element of the Presidency.
The Barcelona process is necessary in order to complete the process started in Lisbon and you have said, Mr President, that there is no better means of achieving social integration than creating employment.
We must send a clear signal, at a time when the European economy is delicate, that the European Union is prepared to make this effort and, therefore, this Parliament and this political group commit ourselves to approving, next week in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, the report by Mr von Wogau so that we may implement the measures contained in the Lamfalussy report, which I believe will send a clear message to the markets that we are willing to reach an agreement - and I am glad that you are here, Mr Prodi, since the Commission has much to say on this issue - a fair agreement, which respects the balance of the institutions, to liberalise that market.
From this point of view, the European Parliament will add to the good initiatives of a Presidency which has ambition and vision.
Mr President, I believe I am the only speaker who has not used up his speaking time.
Mr President, Prime Minister, thank you for your presentation of the Spanish Presidency's priorities.
I will comment on just one of them, namely your determination to complete the single market in the gas and electricity sectors.
We have misgivings about your approach.
You want the EU to be guided by five major principles: openness, liberalisation, competition, transparency and interconnection.
These are fundamental to an open market.
Energy, however, is not like other goods or services.
It has other facets: basic social need and environmental impact.
A rushed and ill-considered liberalisation would be highly dangerous.
Your own country, like California, has recently suffered major power cuts following liberalisation.
Liberalisation leads to a dash for gas, forcing us to import gas from some very fragile regimes.
We need to ensure that indigenous energy sources can play a major role in energy supply.
Renewable energies in particular need legal protection and promotion.
The greatest contribution to security of supply is intelligent use of energy, one of the regulatory requirements of wise liberalisation.
Please ensure that energy efficiency becomes a key national indicator at Barcelona.
Uneven opening of the market between countries brings huge resentment.
We strongly support your efforts to put pressure on certain governments, which keep their markets closed while they take advantage of open markets elsewhere.
I look forward to your assurance that liberalisation of energy will take place in a very strictly regulated framework which protects the environment and takes heed of social consequences, some of which are very serious.
Unlike Mr Evans, we think that is important.
I should like to inform the House that because we are running behind schedule I expect to be in a position to call on the President-in-Office of the Council to respond to the debate at around 12.45 p.m. or 12.50 p.m.
This means that in all probability the vote will not be taken until 1 p.m.
This information will be placed on the screens in Parliament so that colleagues who wish to attend the vote can do so.
But I would like to hear the Prime Minister's response in calm parliamentary conditions, if that is possible.
Mr President, the Spanish Presidency, which has our full support, will play a crucial role in the integration of a Europe which is not just the Europe of the single currency but the Europe of the common foreign and security policy as well.
The Union' s joint action will be judged initially on the success of the fight against terrorism, which is not an internal Spanish affair but a fundamental issue in which we must all be involved, just as we are with regard to the European presence in Afghanistan.
We too will support any undertaking in the Middle East because it is only by resolving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis that we will be able to deliver the final blow to the terrorist organisations.
Indeed, it is a political effort, above all, as well as military endeavours that can bring Europe success against the instigators of the attack of 11 September.
The return to the rule of law in the world will contribute to economic growth and thus help to improve the conditions of the European citizens, whom we also have to provide with a system of social and other protection which abolishes longstanding privileges.
The Convention will also have to decide upon the way to follow to develop the new Charter, and we hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to take place during the second half of 2003 to avoid Europe' s future being debated right in the middle of the electoral campaign.
However, I cannot close without responding to a number of statements made in this House.
The strong Europeanism of Italy and of its democratically elected government is indisputable.
We are always ready to request or provide clarification and would stress that it is absolutely unthinkable that Italy should have anything but an independent, leading role in the development of European unity.
Rather, let the Socialists explain the agreement signed in Berlin with the GDR, with the former supporters of the Berlin wall: an agreement which goes against the great hopes of freedom not just of the German people but of all Europeans.
Mr President, I speak for the Socialists from the point of view of Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
The Barcelona Summit will be a major milestone during the Spanish Presidency and it is essential that we reply to the downward global economic trend by further deepening and strengthening the process laid down at Lisbon and further developed at Stockholm and GÃ¶teborg.
The Lisbon policy mix of mutually supportive economic reform, full employment, social cohesion and sustainable development needs to be reinforced through concrete measures that increase the potential for growth and job creation.
It would be a grave mistake to concentrate - as some have done in the debate today - on only one aspect of the Lisbon process, that of structural reform.
At this time, we need to further develop the coherence of the Lisbon process and reinforce it.
In concrete terms, we want a number of priorities developed at Barcelona, some of which are reflected in the Commission's synthesis report adopted this week.
The following are purely illustrative in the limited time available.
We want a strengthening of resolve to achieve the goal of a 70% employment rate by 2010, recognising the good progress we have seen and increasing the participation of unemployed people in active labour measures to at least 20% in nearly all Member States; we want to go further and set a new target of 44%, the level in the three best-performing Member States, to be achieved within a five-year timeframe.
Within this timeframe we need, among other things, further action for women and older workers able and willing to stay in the labour market; action to improve the availability of affordable and good-quality child care; goals for reductions in youth unemployment and renewed emphasis upon life-long learning, training and improved mobility.
We also need further action to address demographic change through an integrated approach to safeguard sustainable and universal pensions.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Spanish Presidency of the European Union has given itself the theme of 'More Europe' , which is a desire shared by a large majority of Europeans who, as of 1 January 2002, now share the same currency.
'More Europe' must not mean more of an omnipresent, over-bearing Europe.
On the contrary, 'More Europe' must mean more of a political Europe where it is necessary to improve our standing on the international stage and to enable our economies to become stronger and to create further jobs.
Spain is undertaking its third presidency of the Union and therefore has proven experience in this area.
More importantly, the Spanish government led by Mr JosÃ© Maria Aznar, whom I welcome, is implementing a successful policy which, if applied to Europe, could turn out to be extremely worthwhile.
As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned, there is, unfortunately, no need to dwell at length on the tragedies that too often plunge the people of Spain into mourning, as they fall victim to barbaric acts carried out by ETA and its counterparts.
It is now easy for us to understand, particularly after the events of 11 September, that the primary concern of the Spanish Presidency is, quite clearly, the fight against terrorism within an area of freedom, security and justice.
However, what citizens really expect from Europe, and from the authorities in general, is for us to put in place the conditions to create a competitive economy that will guarantee the prosperity of as many people as possible.
Mr Aznar, you know how to do this in Spain; we are sure that you will provide the necessary impetus so that the objective set in Lisbon to achieve full employment by 2010 is consolidated and attained within the framework of a timetable defined at Barcelona in March.
It will come as no surprise to any of you that, having been elected to represent the island of Reunion, I welcome the will that was clearly expressed by the Spanish Presidency to pursue the implementation of Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, so that the special characteristics of such regions are taken into account in each of the European Union' s policies.
Lastly, I would like to point out to the President-in-Office of the Council that the first meeting of the Convention will not be held at the European Parliament' s headquarters in Strasbourg; it will instead take place in one of our working places, namely Brussels.
Mr President, the Spanish Presidency has rightly named the fight against terrorism as its first priority.
The Spanish Presidency has also rightly indicated the importance of money laundering to terrorism.
Because the true driving force of terrorism, at least in Europe, is not ideology, but money.
We are concerned about whether it will be possible for the Council to overcome the obstacle standing in the way of fighting terrorism resulting from certain governments blocking the Community proposals on the fight against money laundering.
Secondly, Mr President, the Spanish Presidency insists on the problem of immigration and the need to control it.
The Presidency' s programme also talks about the outermost regions.
I wanted to link these two problems by pointing out that the outermost regions, although they are far from the Community' s continental territory, are in fact part of our territory and that it is currently necessary to control illegal immigration into these regions.
I do not believe that the procedure adopted by certain local authorities is the appropriate one: i.e. providing free tickets so that illegal immigrants in the Canaries can be transported to the mainland of the continent.
But if we do not adopt measures on a Community level, it is possible that other local authorities will feel obliged to do the same.
Finally, Mr President, over recent years it seems that both the Council and the Commission have forgotten where Latin America is.
It is as if the navigation charts have disappeared.
The Spanish Presidency points to the importance of holding the Ibero-American Summit and, also in the President' s speech, he rightly stresses the importance of helping certain countries such as Argentina and Colombia.
I believe it is very important that the Spanish Presidency takes the helm once again, places Latin America on the continent' s navigation charts and, like in the Fifteenth Century, supports, in this new era, the link between the European Union and Latin America.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to extend a warm welcome to the Spanish Presidency.
Prime Minister Aznar, we have great faith in you, and we also wish you every success on the sound plans you have for the coming six months.
In my view, an important task is to ensure that the Convention, which is to develop proposals on Europe' s future, gets off to a flying start.
It is also important that this be done quickly, and I am pleased to hear it is to be launched as soon as the end of February.
I have heard you say that the reform, or deepening, of the European institutions is necessary in order to make a success of enlargement.
I could not agree more.
I have also heard you call for more co-decision and more transparency.
I would like to endorse that too.
The European Parliament must become a normal parliament with full legislative powers, and the Council, in its capacity as co-legislator, must become more transparent in its working practices, possibly modelling itself on the German Federal Council.
I also support Mr Aznar' s plea for anti-terrorism policy to be accelerated and Europol to be reinforced.
Mr Aznar, you are right in saying that tougher action is required to tackle the drugs trade.
Together with the trafficking in human beings, the drugs trade appears to be one of the key sources of funding for terrorism.
It is high time we clamped down on this evil, and I hope you will receive Dutch support for this.
I should like to finish off with an observation with regard to socio-economic policy.
You have spoken of the need for more labour mobility.
In my country, the Netherlands, there is a labour shortage.
There are tens of thousands, and probably even more than one hundred thousand, vacancies for jobs which cannot be filled.
The care sector and public transport spring to mind.
These sectors are performing badly because of a shortage of labour.
Why are European job agencies not being set up to analyse which countries have labour shortages and which have labour surpluses?
Surely it should be possible, with the help of brief language courses, to help the millions of unemployed in Germany to find jobs in the Netherlands, for example.
If you could do something about this, you would be helping both the countries with labour shortages and those with labour surpluses.
Mr President, Prime Minister, you have, amongst the six priorities of the Spanish Presidency of the Council, managed to say not one word on the protection of the environment.
That is, I admit, a respectable achievement, indeed a transparent one.
I have had to listen too often over the last twelve years to Presidents of the Council who, among their priorities at the outset of their presidency, announce things they cannot bring to pass.
In this case, you do not even announce anything.
I find that very frank, very transparent and very clear.
I am very grateful to Mr Salafranca for bringing Groucho Marx into the discussion earlier on.
I, too, was reminded of Groucho Marx when I listened to that speech, because I must admit that I found it more than grotesque.
Groucho Marx represents the grotesque, and I find it more than grotesque that the Spanish Presidency of the Council, ten years after the Rio Summit and in the year of the Johannesburg World Summit, has nothing to say about the protection of the environment.
Mr Aznar, it is not for your Ministry of the Environment to do that, it is for you to do it.
Let me remind you that the last summit, the Summit in Gothenburg, called upon you, the European Council, to use your meeting in Barcelona in the first half of the year to check on what was still needed.
You must, then, say something about emissions trading.
You must say when you want to ratify the Kyoto protocol.
You must, for example, say when you intend to implement the Sixth Environmental Action Programme's strategies for the various industry sectors.
In no way is that a matter for the environmental authorities in your own country; it is a matter for you personally.
We always consider it important to cooperate closely and well with the Council, and so, Mr Aznar, I offer you assistance should your government have need of it.
I am perfectly ready to offer you all my group's suggestions - with all respect of course - as may be necessary to enable you to perform your duties at the beginning of the year.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I welcome your presidency.
The actual introduction of the euro is a red letter day for those of us who want to see European integration and economic development.
The task for the EU is now to ensure that the euro lives up to the expectations surrounding it.
That is why it is a matter of such urgency that Spain should give priority to a dynamic and competitive Europe.
The Socialist leader in this House, who otherwise appears to have no interest at all in this debate, adopted a particularly 'whining' tone in his remarks on this subject.
The fact is that you as a head of government, Mr Aznar, have made a much more dynamic Spain possible, thanks to modernisation of the administration and of economic life.
By means of important structural changes and tax reductions, Spain now presents fewer obstacles to new companies' setting up and has created new job opportunities.
That is why unemployment is falling and prosperity increasing in Spain.
That may be sad for Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, but it is good for Spaniards.
It is precisely this transformation that the EU must carry out if the Lisbon process is to be taken seriously.
The Socialists have let two out of ten years simply pass by.
The Spanish Presidency must now increase the pressure and, instead of just talking, pursue a policy of prosperity, development and opportunities for the people of Europe.
Enlargement has now entered a crucial phase.
I trust that Spain, which has experienced dictatorship and has secured democracy and freedom through European cooperation, will now guarantee that the Council does not leave anything undone in the work of enlargement under your leadership and that Spain will show the same solidarity and good will as has been shown to your country for fifteen years.
Finally, I am also looking forward to a presidency whose relations with the United States are characterised by friendship, respect and independence.
Good luck in what you intend!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Secretary of State, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has, since the Cologne Extraordinary Summit in June 1999, possessed a European security and defence identity which, for the first time, is truly worthy of the designation 'common' .
We have achieved great steps forward in this area, which will allow us to use the Rapid Reaction Force, which will be ready for action from 2003 onwards, to independently carry out what are termed the Petersberg tasks, at least on our own continent and in any case with an appropriate UN mandate.
Mr President-in-Office, I would like to add a brief observation to your statements and make a major request of the Spanish Presidency.
Taking the observation first, you have described the Rapid Reaction Force as being also an instrument against terrorism in the European Union.
I would say that, in our democratic states, the combating of terrorism is primarily a task for the internal forces of law and order and the justice authorities.
Should military actions also become necessary, as they did after 11 September, what we call the principle of the rule of law nevertheless remains untouched.
My request to the Spanish Presidency is that, where military operations are mounted under the sole leadership of the European Union, there must be the possibility of falling back on the material resources of NATO, especially in transport and reconnaissance capacities, and also, to some extent, in the command structures.
It is truly astonishing that the agreement we need between the EU and NATO has, through Turkey's resistance, not yet come about.
The proposal that Great Britain and the United States, without the EU's mandate, presented at the Laeken Summit, is unsuitable and unacceptable.
So I ask that the Spanish Presidency should see to it that we get an agreement with NATO, so that our security and defence policy may be secured.
Mr President, Spain is assuming the Presidency of the European Union at an historic moment for European integration.
Two major events have occurred.
The people of Europe now have the euro in their pockets.
This is an incredible success and we must rapidly construct the political Europe that they lack.
The second major event was 11 September, which reminded us, as if this were necessary, of the nature of the new threats hanging over the world.
The Spanish Presidency is facing these two challenges.
By placing the fight against terrorism at the forefront of its programme, the Spanish Presidency is thus meeting the expectations of a Europe that must become an area of security and a constitutional State for all European citizens.
All resources must be properly implemented at European level to strengthen the instruments of the constitutional State, such as the introduction of the European arrest warrant, the freezing of funds, the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the development of Eurojust.
However, in order to meet the expectations of our fellow citizens, we have to face another challenge. We must bring about a strong, powerful, and therefore democratic, political Europe.
The Spanish Presidency will be able to use the work of the Convention so that it can go ahead, at last, with the simplification of the treaties, with the task of clearly dividing up the competences between the European Union and Member States, but, above all, with rapidly bringing about the drafting of a European constitution.
On all of these issues, I know that the Spanish Presidency will press ahead with determination.
The programme that was proposed to us today meets the challenges facing us.
We know your vision, we know your determination, and that is why we have confidence in you.
Mr President, tomorrow this Parliament will approve the resolution on the Commission' s Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy, which draws up its future.
I would like the motto 'more Europe' , chosen by the Spanish Presidency, to be converted this year into the definitive integration of fishing into the single market, and I would like a CFP to be more participatory, a CFP whose definition and application involve the presence not only of central governments but also of the regions, of regions with competences in the field of fishing, and of course economic and social actors.
Fishing, Mr President, works on an international basis, like the whole of the economy.
Its reform cannot ignore this reality.
Nevertheless, it worries us to see that the Community fleet' s access to external waters is being restricted and that our fleet is losing fishing grounds rather than gaining them.
In six months' time we will be able to judge this Presidency by its results and see whether it has been able to reverse this trend.
Given the importance of this economic activity to numerous European regions, most of them peripheral and Objective 1, and its role as an element of economic integration and social cohesion, we want you to take it into account as a priority objective when it comes to strategies for safeguarding the European social model, which you mentioned in your speech.
I would like you to make that explicit commitment here, thereby helping this sector to recover its fighting spirit and confidence.
Mr President, amongst the priorities of the Spanish Presidency, I have heard no mention of a European policy that shows greater solidarity with the rest of the world.
As coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like you to clarify your plans for social development and for the reduction of poverty, which the Commission, Parliament and previous presidencies have set as objectives.
You mentioned the Monterrey International Conference.
What position will you be adopting on the policies that need to be funded?
Who is to fund them?
Are you going to support the objective of 0.7% of GDP, approved at the last Development Council by the majority of Member States?
How much cooperation will there be with Latin America and with the countries of the Mediterranean, with an integrated approach between trade relations and the fight against poverty?
What will your position be on the commitments given through the United Nations programmes on education and health for all?
What will your position be on the current conflicts in Africa?
I hope that on all of these issues you will consult the European Parliament and, also, civil society and the NGOs.
I wish you a Presidency, Mr Aznar, that will be fruitful for Europe.
Mr President, Mr Aznar has laid down the clear objective of 'More Europe' for the Spanish Presidency and has explained how he intends to carry out the programme.
Time constraints dictate that we will have to focus on a small number of issues and not waste words.
The first issue is the Convention, which will have to supplement the Charter of Fundamental Rights, promoting the Community method and the federalist approach as a guarantee of political democracy, economic integration and social cohesion.
The second issue is the Lisbon reforms, which have now become intertwined with the launch of the euro.
The single currency consolidates the single market and represents a decisive step towards political Europe and a common economic policy.
The single currency strengthens Europe' s position in the face of globalisation but means that it is no longer possible for national systems to restore competitiveness by devaluing.
The Stability Pact must be respected.
In the interests of economic recovery and employment, therefore, the structural reforms, mentioned specifically by President Prodi, need to be pursued with the necessary determination.
This strategy must be consistent with the overall goals of integration, cohesion and harmonisation of the series of policies upholding the European social model.
It is not easy to pursue apparently conflicting goals in a balanced way, but this is the challenge of the present times.
The third issue is the 'political' contribution that Europe can make to the fight against terrorism which has been occupying all the major democracies since 11 September.
I call, in particular, for the reinvigoration of the Mediterranean policy and for peace initiatives in the Middle East. Spain has, on many occasions, been at the forefront of action addressing these issues.
Lastly, I support the pledge made by Mr Aznar regarding Argentina, a country afflicted by a crisis which is threatening democracy itself and which could exacerbate the difficult situations of other Latin American countries.
Mr President, as the last speaker, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for having remained present in the Chamber for the entire debate.
In this speech, which will be brief, I should also like, first of all, to express my personal satisfaction at the presence in the Chamber today of the President of the Spanish government, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, who, long before the events of 11 September had already made the defence of freedom and the fight against those who seek to curb it, such as terrorist murderers, one of the leitmotivs of his political approach.
The results of this political action at European level could not be more heartening.
Secondly, the Union' s immigration policy, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, requires your drive and your sensitivity towards such a burning issue, which is, I note, one of the Presidency' s objectives.
I refer, for example, to the undeniable need to give a boost to Community legislation regulating aspects as important as family reunification, asylum procedure, or reception conditions for asylum seekers, in order to achieve a proper organisation of migratory flows, which effectively combats people trafficking in human need and who are responsible for the tragic deaths that are taking place in some parts of European territory, such as the Andalusian and other Spanish coastlines.
Before I call the next speaker I ask colleagues in the House to take their seats so that we can listen with some parliamentary dignity to the reply of the presidency.
Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen.
I thank you for all of the speeches you have made during this sitting, which I have listened to with the greatest interest.
I wish to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that, of course, I share many of the aspirations that you have expressed here today.
I also share many of your concerns but nor should it come as a surprise to anybody that I do not fully agree with some of what I have heard.
I must of course, say, however, that, in general terms, I have the feeling that the basic elements of the issues, the objectives and the hopes that we, the various institutions and Europe' s citizens in general share are or can, quite reasonably, be promoted for the future, when it comes to putting our ideas and our plans into practice.
I should like, first of all, to emphasise the importance of institutional dialogue and, within institutional dialogue, once again emphasise my commitment.
We will have the opportunity to speak about this European impetus and also about the work of the Spanish Presidency, both in March, following the Barcelona European Council, and in June, following the Seville European Council.
This is not, of course, to undermine the importance of the appearances by various members of the Spanish government at the various parliamentary bodies of this institution.
I must tell you that, as holder of the Presidency, I see no problem in establishing what some of you have requested: the creation of a working group for interinstitutional dialogue that encompasses the Council, Parliament and the Commission and which will enable us to see clearly how best our work can be carried out.
I do not think that the Commission has any problem with this either.
Therefore, from this point of view, I am aware of, and agree with some of your concerns, such as the processing of documents concerning the second and third pillars, which must be resolved with all the guarantees required by the circumstances, the facts themselves and by the sensitivity of the matter, as is done in many national parliaments, with guarantees of security and of confidentiality.
We can clearly make progress on many of these issues and, therefore, the Presidency will not raise any opposition to the creation of this interinstitutional working group.
I should like to focus my speech, if I may, on the Presidency' s objectives and work programme and on no other matter.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have before us an extremely important opportunity for the European Union, at an historic juncture, which is of great significance.
In my opinion, we have before us an opportunity of which we must not fail to take advantage.
This opportunity is evident in various situations.
The entire world situation has changed following 11 September and in a tragic fashion.
The priority in the world today is security and the fight against terrorism.
The change that has taken place since 11 September is causing fundamental strategic changes in the world that will define the world of tomorrow, on which the European institutions must reflect, maintain dialogue and on which they must adopt a position for the future.
The European Union as such, through its various institutions, cannot remain on the sidelines of the important debate and participation in the profound strategic changes that the world will be seeing.
Secondly, this is a very important opportunity from the economic point of view. I say this for various reasons.
Firstly, because for the first time we have the euro, our single currency, which is a guarantee of stability and which has been a great success.
Secondly, because for structural reasons, to which I shall refer later, our economies need to continue putting their faith in major reforms.
Thirdly, because we are going through a period of economic slowdown and unless we can take advantage of the introduction of the euro, providing impetus for economic reforms, we will be wasting an opportunity to help our economies to recover, which is, of course, extremely important.
The third aspect that must be emphasised is that we are close to concluding a process which has, of course, a huge scope, that we might call enlargement, expansion or whatever we want; but which is, ultimately, the great political process of European unification.
This is the objective that would, in itself, of course, fulfil the ambitions of a political generation that is able to look back on European history and which is concerned about planning and organising our future in a reasonable way.
Lastly, we are aware that we must undertake a reform of the institutions, and we have, for this purpose, proposed the Convention and an Intergovernmental Conference.
All of these ambitions provide us with a crucial opportunity.
I wish to convey to the European Parliament the commitment of the Spanish Presidency to share ambitions and, at the same time, to work coherently to achieve our objectives more effectively.
This is why we have set out various priorities, on which, in response to your speeches, I should like to briefly comment.
First of all, with regard to the fight against terrorism, this is no longer a problem affecting only some people, but one that affects all of us, a problem to which some could show greater commitment, but it is quite clearly the responsibility of everyone.
Of course, I appreciate, as I have said, the work and the efforts that the European Parliament has devoted to this matter.
Of course, we have to consider the fight against terrorism not only in itself but also in relation to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, and to the Tampere commitments that are part of this more integrated Europe that we wish to build for the future.
Various speakers, in particular Mr Poettering, have called for us to be resolute in the fight against terrorism.
They are right.
We must ask ourselves if in general terms, the European Union is capable at this historic juncture of dealing with the task in hand.
I would say that it is reasonably capable, that the European arrest and surrender warrant - supported, of course, by all Fifteen Member States of the Union - the fight against the funding of terrorist organisations and the definition of a list of groups of organisations and persons that support terrorism are extraordinary steps.
It is my fervent hope that in its sitting of 5 February, the European Parliament will also take a definitive step in this direction.
How can this be done?
This must be done on the basis of the guarantees provided by the Rule of Law.
You are quite right, ladies and gentlemen, in saying that the Rule of Law and our freedoms must be fully guaranteed.
It is also true, and it should not be forgotten at this time that this is exactly what safeguards democracies and that this is exactly what these people wish to destroy and what those who dedicate themselves to carrying out or supporting terrorism wish to put an end to.
Maintaining democracy through the Rule of Law is precisely, of course, our best guarantee.
There cannot be - and indeed there are none - half-way houses in the fight against terrorism, because there are no half-way houses between life and death, between legality and lawlessness, between respect for the law and complicity with terrorism.
What there must be is a clear defence, when necessary, from an international point of view, by means of an international coalition, and, when necessary, with the domestic commitment or with the international cooperation of all, to ensure that our freedoms and our Rule of law triumph.
And in order to achieve this, we have to work, from an operational perspective, on issues of security, intelligence, cooperation between police forces, joint investigation teams and also on the common judicial issues that are a crucial part of the process of European integration.
Furthermore, if we are coherent and consider terrorism to be one of the greatest threats currently facing our civilisation, we will have to include terrorism as an objective in the definition of the European Union' s security and defence policy.
I think that this is a very important aspect and warrants very special treatment, at least in two chapters of relations that are highly relevant to the European Union: the first concerns the United States, with whom we also have discuss legal and criminal matters, whilst at the same time, of course, respecting our extradition system and maintaining our position of clear opposition to the death penalty, or of support for the jurisdiction of the courts and for all the sentences that can be handed down to an individual.
But we have to discuss such matters.
We also have to discuss matters in order to reach conclusions on some of your concerns about the importance of cooperation with Russia in the fight against terrorism.
I am sorry to interrupt, Prime Minister.
Colleagues, I really must insist that you take your places quietly.
I ask the ushers to approach any Members who are having conversations and ask them to sit or to leave.
We cannot work in intolerable parliamentary conditions on an occasion such as this!
Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council.
I note your willingness to come before the House after the Barcelona Summit, which we believe is an important additional moment for dialogue between our institutions.
Vote
. I tried to tell the House that, as some colleagues know, almost all my livestock contracted foot-and-mouth disease and were slaughtered.
However, since I do not consider the proposed Committee of Inquiry will affect me financially, I voted in favour of the inquiry.
Election of Quaestors of Parliament
The next item is the second round of the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament.
Voting: 570, valid votes: 567. Majority: 284.
Mr Poos: 304 - elected
Mr Balfe: 288 - elected
Mrs Smet: 288 - elected
Mr Marinho: 264
Mrs Maes: 116.
No further votes are required.
We have filled all five positions for Quaestor.
I congratulate all the individuals who have been elected.
I invite you to a brief reception.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.24 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
I should like to inform the House that our colleague in the Socialist Group, Mr John Hume, will have the distinction in the near future of being awarded the Mahatma Ghandi Peace Prize by the Indian Government.
The recipient last year of this new prize was Mr Nelson Mandela.
Given his outstanding record of commitment to peace and reconciliation in Ireland, I am very pleased to congratulate him.
I am sure the House will be very proud of this recognition of one of our most distinguished Members.
Welcome
The Delegation for Relations with Russia is today being honoured with a visit by our Russian colleagues, including Mr Vladimir Lukin.
I see that Vladimir, who is an old friend of mine, is upstairs already.
You are very welcome, Vladimir.
He is Deputy Chairman of the Russian State Duma and Co-Chairman of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.
It is wonderful to see you here, and I hope we can meet personally.
I should not say these things from the chair.
Vladimir, I have only been learning how to be a chairman here since yesterday but it is good to see old friends come to the House.
Introduction of the euro
The next item is the debate on the introduction of the euro, which we have now had in our pockets for some weeks and which is the fulfilment of a long-cherished dream in the European Community.
It has been a wonderful tribute to the capacity of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks; it has been a wonderful tribute to the banking and financial and commercial system and the retailing system; and, most of all, a wonderful tribute to European citizens, who have taken to it with such alacrity, that now it has virtually displaced the currencies in the relevant Member States.
Thank you, Commissioner.
As you remarked, many were referred to and thanked earlier today.
Of course we should thank you and your staff and the College of Commissioners now for all the work you have done in the past several years to bring this to a reality.
You have our congratulations and respect for doing that.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this speech is the last I shall deliver in this Chamber as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I have been a member of this Committee for 22 years.
From tomorrow, I shall be a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I am convinced that the next step on the road to the realisation of the European Union must be political union.
I look forward to working on this task in future.
Looking back over these years, I would like to start by recalling our colleague Basil de Ferranti, now sadly deceased, who at that time drafted the first reports on the creation of the internal market and thereby initiated this whole development.
It started off as a working party on technical barriers to trade, later spawning the Kangaroo Group.
These were the first initiatives towards creating the internal market.
Jacques Delors was at that time the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in other words, Mrs Randzio-Plath, our predecessor; he then, as French Finance Minister and later as President of the European Commission, laid the foundations on which these ideas were to become realities.
I wish also to recall Jacques Moreau who, together with me back then in 1984, presented the first report of the European Parliament on proposals for the creation of the internal market.
Seeing the enthusiasm that greeted the euro on 1 January, welcoming this new currency for 300 million people in the European Union, we have to recall, on the one hand, how difficult was the road to this.
On the other hand, though, we also have to ask ourselves what conditions are required for the euro, our common currency, to be successful in the long term?
Let me here list three conditions.
The first is the consistent development of the Stability and Growth Pact.
It is indeed almost ironic that we see today that it was Germany, my homeland, that campaigned most vigorously then for this Stability and Growth Pact with its strict criteria, and that one can, or must, almost take it for granted in the present situation that Germany will be the first country to be affected by this treaty's sanctions.
I take the view, though, that we must be consistent here if we want the euro to become and remain a stable currency in the long term and interest rates in the European Union to remain low in the long term for our enterprises, as a condition of investment and growth.
The second condition is that, in the Member States and in the EU, we make economic policy in accordance with principles held in common.
It was by a large majority the will of Parliament that these principles should be those of the social market economy.
Thirdly, we must move forward to political union.
We said before Maastricht that we wanted monetary union and political union at the same time.
Even then we were saying that monetary union cannot exist in the long term without political union.
We must stay consistent on this point.
It is now that we must take these steps to political union, at the core of which is a common foreign and security policy.
I would like, finally, to pick up on something Jacques Delors said.
Jacques Delors, during the interminable debates we had on the European internal market, once remarked, and quite rightly, that you could not fall in love with an internal market.
In other words, there is very little emotion involved.
I would also say that the same applies to a currency, although there are some of us who have a very emotional, almost erotic, relationship with the currency.
What we need, though, and what we must bring to light, is the awareness of a common European identity, Europe-consciousness.
I believe that is surely the most important task facing us as the European Parliament.
Mr President, the introduction of euro notes and coins has not only been a success in logistical and organisational terms, but is also already contributing to the enhanced creation and discovery of a European identity.
Not even Eurosceptics in Italy can do anything about that.
The tangible euro makes Europe a fact of daily life, just as we MEPs always said it would.
The euro was, in a manner of speaking, Parliament's first choice since it was itself directly elected, a choice above all by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs To that extent, the euro has for two decades been one of Parliament's successful projects.
We took our stand for a market and a currency and played our part in creating them.
I think that thanks are owed to all the Members of this House, and to you too, Mr von Wogau.
(Applause)
'Euro' will in my view become the affirmative word of 2002.
After all, the euro embodies Europe's dynamism and determination to create a European identity, improve European competitiveness for the benefit of the economy and employment and grow together into permanent mutual solidarity.
Monetary union completes the internal market - the right answer to the challenges of globalisation - and makes it at last work for everyone, for small and medium-sized enterprises and above all for people.
The euro will become a success because it is accepted not only by the markets but also by people.
Many are at last rejoicing - as we Members always predicted they would - to be living in Euroland.
The success of the introduction of euro notes and coins fills everyone with enthusiasm and creates the climate of optimism that we in Europe urgently need for investment, stimulation of internal demand and thus for employment. The introduction of euro notes and coins crowns and rewards the sustained efforts on the road towards monetary union.
Today, many people are already wondering why euro notes and coins had not been introduced much earlier, something we Members had always demanded.
We call upon Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain to come into the eurozone in their own interest before eastward enlargement takes place.
The German mark was a currency with a proud past.
Three years of monetary union promise us an equally stable monetary future.
There have in any case been lower interest rates under monetary union than in the decades of the German mark that preceded it.
This is connected with the low level of interest, which guarantees good financial conditions that favour investment.
It follows that monetary union has kept to what was promised politically in the Maastricht Treaty, namely price stability.
The introduction of euro notes and coins, then, also brings visible successes for consumers: prices for consumer durables, such as cars, will fall.
By its completion of the internal market programme, the euro also at last makes possible consumer-friendly competition, which will lead to medium-term pressure on prices and an incentive to higher quality.
The completion of economic and monetary union, of the internal reform of the European Union and of a European constitution and the successful eastward enlargement of the EU are the great challenges that Europe must face up to.
There is one thing, though, that we must not forget: the euro is not only a monetary project; it was always a political project and is a component of the political union of Europe.
Europe is small in global terms, and so the internal market, completed by monetary union, is quite certainly the right answer.
The euro, moreover, puts to the test the ability of Europeans to organise unity in the interests of all Europe's states.
As far as further bold European projects are concerned, it is both a connecting link between them and a stumbling block.
William Shakespeare was right to maintain that 'if money go before, all ways do lie open' .
It is to be hoped that that applies also to more efficient and improved coordination of economic, financial, employment and social security policies.
The euro urgently needs to be accompanied by some sort of economic government.
Cyclic developments are no longer triggered by nation states, but by economic issues, and so the EU summit in Barcelona has been required to exchange dogmatism in handling the Stability and Growth Pact, which does leave some room to manoeuvre, for a sound policy which is committed to monetary, financial and also social stability.
Our commitment as a Parliament to monetary dialogue with the European Central Bank was particularly important.
We took our stand in Parliament for the independence of the European Central Bank, but also demonstrated our commitment to that institution's democratic accountability.
Hence it is very important that we should have organised and motivated a cultural revolution in Europe, for the Member States' dealings with the national central banks used not to have the democratic accountability we have now.
Money policy thus becomes transparent and comprehensible and helps us to fathom this mystery as well.
For money policy is not neutral; it too has an influence on the real economy, on growth and employment.
Mr President, my group has decided that the coordinators in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism must be elected at 3.30 p.m.
Since I am one of the candidates, my presence there will be required.
Could I ask whether Mr Pronk could read out my two-minute speech in my place when my name appears on screen?
Mrs Peijs, I have no objection to that if it is acceptable to the House, which I think it is.
So let us act on that basis.
Thank you.
Mr President, I will speak on my own behalf.
On 1 January, many European citizens made their first acquaintance with the new currency: the euro. And what an acquaintance that was.
Barely two weeks have passed and the euro has replaced the national currencies everywhere.
If Parliament' s wish to distribute euro notes among the public before 1 January had been complied with, a few smaller problems might have been avoided, but that is probably just a detail.
I could not agree more that the changeover has been a runaway success.
This is mainly due to the citizens of Europe, a fact to which you yourself have already made reference, as befits a good Liberal.
They have reacted to the currency change with enthusiasm and patience.
Shopkeepers should also be praised.
They have borne the burden of the actual implementation and, in my view, they are therefore the heroes of the conversion.
However, in my opinion, the introduction of the euro notes and coins is merely a first step, and Commissioner Solbes Mira has already made reference to this.
What matters most now is to ensure that the new currency continues to be successful.
This requires quite a bit from all participating countries: the political will to support the currency and not to cast it in a bad light, as some members of the Italian government have done, the political courage to leave the Stability Pact intact so that the correct financial framework of the euro continues to exist, and the political power to build on the success of the euro.
The time has come therefore, following the most successful European project ever, to take steps in order to further develop the internal market.
If we really want to achieve the objectives prescribed in Lisbon, we must commit ourselves to the further liberalisation of the internal market and to making it more flexible.
There are five clear priorities in this respect, namely postal services, transport, electricity, gas and water.
These are vital in the liberalised and flexible knowledge-based economy that we are pursuing in Europe, and also in the interests of the citizen.
In this way, the citizens know where they stand with Europe.
Only by choosing this option can the EU' s economic power be realised and the new currency kept strong.
Mr President, Commissioner, the largely successful introduction of the euro notes and coins proves one thing and one thing alone: that the people of Europe are highly pragmatic.
The markets, which always have the choice, appear to be much less enthusiastic.
In any case, I believe that the people will use price levels as the true factor that determines whether or not they will adopt the Euroland currency.
However, this currency, which does not belong to any one State, is now posing new problems.
Shopkeepers have already had to carry out, free of charge, the work of the banks during the introduction of the euro.
It is conceivable that, during this period, shopkeepers had the same interest as consumers in doing this.
But now the problem of counterfeiting has surfaced.
Forged notes are already at large and it is easy to envisage the different currencies of north and south Euroland intermingling this summer.
For example, the EUR 200 and EUR 500 notes, which were not printed in France and in the countries of southern Europe, will reach us, which is in fact already happening with notes of German origin.
Next summer, these notes will be everywhere.
Obviously, shopkeepers are unable to identify potential forgeries which are worth, if you will forgive me for saying so, more than 3 500 of our poor old francs, in other words, half the minimum wage in France.
The Commission will be responsible for compensating the victims and those misled by forged euro, since no State can be.
But will the European citizens and the shopkeepers, who accept forged currency by mistake and because they are unable to tell the difference, be compensated by Member States or by the European Central Bank?
Mr President, Commissioner, the euro is an undeniable success, and this is thanks to the European Central Bank, the Commission and all those who worked on the project, including the Members of Parliament.
Mr von Wogau said that the next stage would be political union.
I agree, but I feel it would be a mistake to think that the success of the euro, its capacity to be a strong, stable, reliable currency lies in political union, which is necessary for other reasons.
The euro will be a strong currency if Europe' s economy is strong.
Commissioner, you mentioned the need to coordinate economic policies several times in your speech.
I feel that there is something which is even more important than coordinating economic policies, which, if we overdo it, could even have negative repercussions.
It is important for there to be sound economic policies in Europe: the strength of the euro will depend on it.
We must combine the transparent policies and get away from the present rigidity.
The strength of the euro, then, will depend on the ability of these transparent policies to make the economic systems more dynamic - as Mr Maaten said - to free them from the constraints of corporatism and dirigisme, to liberalise the markets, etc. All this is often the result of too little rather than too much economic policy and, in this respect, I feel that the tension between policies, the competition between the many different solutions adopted by the countries is of benefit and, through a form of bona fide benchmarking, can foster positive processes of emulation.
Although it does need some fine-tuning, the framework of the single market, together with the Stability Pact - an economic Constitution which many countries like Italy did indeed lack - is broad enough to be able to embrace, without conflict or contradiction, a transparent range of options between which it is left to the individual countries to decide.
I believe that leaving the Member States the leeway to choose between options within the framework of the single market will lead to a stronger economy and that, as a result, the conditions necessary for a stronger single currency will emerge.
Mr President, I am indeed reading the text of Mrs Peijs, and in order to emphasise this, I am standing in her place, but to remove any doubt you may have: I am totally behind it.
The 'euro introduction' project has been a success.
In the Netherlands and in Ireland, the introduction of the euro is practically completed.
More than 90% of all payments are already conducted in euros.
Mrs Peijs is proud - and I could not agree more - that European citizens have so quickly adopted the euro with such a great sense of innovation and have put their own currencies to one side.
The Europeans did not need long changeover periods.
Today, we undoubtedly owe a special word of thanks and recognition to the retail trade, which has absorbed a whole host of difficulties with appropriate flexibility.
The banks and their staff have also contributed a great deal to the smooth transition.
We must now take an important next step.
The euro must remain a stable and strong currency.
For that purpose, the President of the Central Bank must first and foremost remain where he is and must closely monitor the bank' s objectives, namely low inflation.
It is almost more important for the Member States to start to realise that they are not on their own and are not fully autonomous, but that everything they do, and notably what they do not do, has a bearing on the entire Community and on the stability of the currency.
In order to sustain the confidence of the markets, it is very important for the large Member States in particular - and perhaps notably Germany - at long last to take the necessary measures to open up their markets completely, to make their labour markets more flexible, to make their pension systems sustainable and to modernise their social benefits.
Instead of being the Union' s driving force, these countries act more as a brake on the Union' s progress.
Any weakness in the currency is down to the Member States and so far not to the Central Bank, which is operating exceptionally well, except in the field of payment balance systems, such as TARGET, and the consumer system.
Mr President, Commissioner, there are two aspects of the introduction of the euro which have been mentioned by Commissioner Solbes and other speakers: the undeniable success and future prospects of the euro.
I will use the short amount of time available to me to concentrate on the second aspect, for the euro really is an open door to the future.
Indeed, I feel that, in addition to its great symbolic significance, the introduction of the euro will not bring immediate short-term effects for our economy or in terms of the rate of inflation; however I do feel that it provides Europe with a wonderful opportunity to develop in a climate of stability, particularly as regards the medium and long term.
In the medium term, Europe has the problem of how to disengage its economy from the US cycle.
Indeed, still today, European development is heavily influenced by exports and, therefore, to a great extent by US demand.
This being the case, the current recession in the United States could impact on us rather than be offset by our capacity for independent growth.
This capacity for development of internal demand can benefit greatly from the integration of monetary policy, but it does not depend on this alone.
It needs to be boosted by an economic policy which combines monetary policy with fiscal policy and, most importantly, with a policy of research and innovative investment such as that outlined at Lisbon, although this policy has not actually been pursued.
The problem exists in the longer term of the euro as a potential world-wide reserve currency on an equal footing with the dollar.
A Parliamentary resolution has already pointed out that the central guideline for the exchange policy should not be a strong or weak euro but a stable euro, varying, of course, within a range in a way that is not destabilising.
To this end, it will be necessary, sooner or later, to promote some form of agreement between the US and European monetary policies for our mutual and shared benefit.
It is true, then, that the euro does represent a major opportunity, but it is an opportunity which has not yet been exploited.
This potential role - as the previous speakers have said too - must be fully realised by politics, by Europe' s political capacity, by a government responsible for the economy which promotes the conditions for autonomous development within Europe and which ensures effective management of exchange outside Europe.
Mr President, President Prodi told us this morning that the introduction of euro notes and coins was a huge success.
And several Members have gone even further by speaking of the enthusiasm of consumers, who appear to have embraced the new currency.
In our view, these comments are excessive.
It is true that the changeover to euro notes and coins was well executed, technically speaking, but the consumers had no other choice than, sooner or later, to use the new money.
The real test will be that of managing the euro in the years to come.
And, in this respect, if I were a federalist, I would not be pleased.
I would be rather concerned, because, today, the people who occupy a very difference position to us on the political stage, such as Jacques Delors, are saying exactly what we have always said, namely that the euro cannot function as it is.
We should speed up integration, as Mr Prodi said.
We should strengthen the economic pillar or move towards a political Europe, as other Members are saying.
In short, we need more supranational power to integrate at European level; in other words, that Europe is turned into more of a super-State.
There is the rub, Mr President.
Is Europe prepared to accept this super-State?
No, it is not!
First of all, the nations of Europe are sufficiently diverse in every respect that it is not possible to create an optimal monetary zone.
Some of our Members will certainly say that a super-State with the power to ensure consistency is all the more necessary.
Yes, admittedly, it might be all the more necessary, but at the same time, it is all the more impossible.
So this is the vicious circle in which the euro zone countries will struggle over the coming years.
You could also say that it is a race against time. For the euro to work, either those who oversee it will fairly soon manage to pull apart the nations and build the super-State - and then the euro can survive, but what state will Europe and democracy be in? - or the nations, simply because of their differences, will make it impossible to manage the single currency.
As for us, it is clear what we prefer, Mr President, out of an affection for our homelands and because of our belief in the fundamental need for a national framework for democracy and solidarity.
Is there not a third option, however, that of a single currency without a State?
This could appeal to us, but no one actually knows how it would work if confronted with asymmetric shocks.
Furthermore, the markets themselves do not believe in it, as proven by the persistent weakness of the euro in recent days.
The euro, then, is launching us into an adventure with very serious political and financial consequences of which the citizens were not warned in advance and which they are not prepared to shoulder.
It should really be the people who invented the euro who are concerned.
Mr President, the launch of the notes and coins has finally made the euro a political reality for the 300 million people of Euroland.
Coming from a country which is out, and a party which opposes joining, I was half expecting more glitches and popular resentment at the imposition of an unfamiliar currency.
So far so good, with little inflationary rounding-up.
I congratulate the ECB, the Commission and the national central banks on their handling of the logistics of this massive undertaking without any upsurge in armed robbery or counterfeiting, although I still question the need for a EUR 500 note which can only facilitate criminality.
The naturally cautious British Conservative position is that, although the euro may be an added convenience to travellers and improve price transparency in the single market, it is undoubtedly intended primarily to bolster pan-European identity as a stepping stone to further political integration - something admitted to by everybody bar Mr Blair and our Labour Government - and to control not only of monetary policy, but also of taxation.
The "one size fits all" monetary policy, as the Commission's pessimistic 2001 economic report admits, cannot be right for all of the countries all of the time and, coupled with the fiscal restraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, imposes severe destabilising problems and a lack of flexibility on certain economies, as we have already seen in the artificial boom scenario of Ireland.
The risks of an asymmetric shock developing will only get bigger after enlargement as European labour markets remain unreformed and largely immobile.
President Prodi has admitted this inherent risk and the call will come very shortly for a much bigger EU budget and direct EU taxes to set up bail-out funds to compensate affected countries for their loss of rights to devalue their currencies or lower their interest rates.
Nevertheless, I wish the euro well as the currency of our major trading partners, since UK prosperity is also affected by its stability.
I hope that my pessimistic prognosis, which echoes that of the Commission's own, proves to be wrong over time.
I would also like confirmation from Commissioner Solbes that, in his opinion, for the UK to join the euro it will have to spend at least two years locked into the ERM II phase first before proceeding.
Finally, I should like to congratulate you, Mr President, on your election.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank all the speakers for their comments.
I wish to begin by giving special thanks to Karl von Wogau for his involvement in this process over the last 22 years.
We are sorry to see him leave the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, but we know that his skills will continue to help Parliament and the process of European integration in the Committee of Foreign Affairs.
Karl von Wogau said, in a reference to Jacques Delors, that it is impossible to fall in love with the euro, and yet Christa Randzio-Plath said that Europe' s citizens are happy.
Both comments might be linked to one fundamental factor: the euro is the first aspect of European identity to affect all citizens of the Member States of the Monetary Union.
The euro is extremely important, as were the removal of borders or the internal market, which, nevertheless, only affect goods and citizens crossing the border at a given time, but it is also a piece of our European identity, which we use every day from morning till night, in all the countries of the Monetary Union and exactly in the same conditions.
Because there are clearly also striking differences between us, this aspect, out of all our common aspects, must be highlighted as a very positive one, as the others have nothing to do with any form of unification.
From now on, the euro will give us notes and coins and a slight increase in economic growth, as a consequence of uncertainties being eliminated.
It is true, however, and I am in agreement on this with some of the speakers, that the fundamental elements will emerge as a result of our potential capacity for growth or, to put it another way, as a result of implementing the Lisbon process in a more ambitious way than we have done so far.
We will be able to break free from the United States, as Mr Ruffolo suggests we would want to do.
Nevertheless, experience and the year 2001 have shown us that being relatively independent in terms of trade does not protect us from the effects of a crisis in the United States as a consequence of the course which takes place due to the economic effects arising from the relationships between companies and between financial markets.
The exchange rate will be the real test of the euro.
I have always said that the exchange rate was never an objective of the Union' s policy.
Our objective for monetary policy is to maintain low inflation and we are convinced that a currency with low inflation is, in the long term, a stable currency, a popular currency, a currency that will provide refuge and is a currency that will have an important role to play in the economic world.
Apart from the purely economic aspects, however, what is happening with our institutional structure?
Is the euro the beginning of economic government?
I would say that the model we put together in Maastricht was based on a single monetary policy and on coordinated national economic policies.
This is our model.
And we have to work on ensuring that the euro is a success on this basis.
I am not going to prejudge whether we should make more or less progress in the processes of political integration.
It could be done according to the wishes of those that favour greater political integration, but I also realise that this is a decision to be taken by the fifteen Member States in other bodies, in other forums and following a different debate.
Nevertheless, I am convinced that we can move ahead with the process of greater coordination between economic policies, which certainly does not mean the unification of our economic policies, because our situations are different and, consequently, policies must be applied consistently.
Today, like so often before, we have tended to confuse stability pacts with economic policy guidelines.
Is the Stability Pact the problem for the Union' s economic policy?
This is something we have discussed on more than one occasion in this House.
I repeat what I have always said: the Stability Pact is nothing more and nothing less than a necessary factor which allows us to maintain a policy mix between budgetary policy and monetary policy, which facilitates a monetary policy with low rates of interest.
Structural changes to our economies and the move towards growth, coherence between our national economic policies and Union policy as a whole with monetary policy must be managed by means of these broad economic policy guidelines.
We have the necessary instruments; we have to perfect and improve them, but I think that the system is a good one.
The policy mix will be one of the key elements of the Spanish Presidency, as the chairman of Ecofin stressed and I am sure we will have the opportunity in this House to debate this fundamental point.
Of course, the structural reforms, as I said earlier, are still the key to the future.
I wish to make a comment on enlargement of the euro zone.
We have noted greater interest in the 'pre-in' countries in what is happening in our experience in the euro zone.
Or rather, I would say that in the three 'pre-in' countries, considerable further interest has been aroused, which is reflected in some political attitudes that have been communicated or which we have seen in recent days.
Admittedly, there are still some who criticise the euro and what some people in the Eurosceptic world are afraid of, since the short term problems have not occurred, is what will happen in ten or fifteen years' time.
Obviously, there is nothing we can say on this point.
It is difficult to control what will happen in ten or fifteen years' time, but I personally am convinced that by then we will have far fewer problems than we do at the moment in this regard.
What conditions will be imposed on the 'pre-in' countries in order for them to join the Union?
Exactly the same as those imposed on the other countries, no more and no less.
Compliance with the Maastricht criteria, with the additional factor of the opt-out clause to which Denmark and the United Kingdom have the right.
There will be no change either for the 'pre-in' or for the candidate countries.
We take the view that the equal treatment of all Member States of the Union is a fundamental principle, which we should not alter under any circumstances.
A last comment on an issue that might be a minor one but which is, to a certain extent, the issue that has concerned us today: the practical problems involved in the introduction of the euro.
Have businesses played the role of the bankers?
No, they have not.
Through the system of frontloading, businesses have acted as an incentive for the rapid take-up of the single currency.
It is true that some practical problems have occurred, due more to pressure by some citizens to use businesses as a bank, when they have tried to change high denominations of national currency in businesses and not in the banks, as should have been predicted.
Have there been serious problems of counterfeiting?
There have been neither serious nor less serious problems in this area.
So far, we have not seen counterfeits that could technically be called 'counterfeit euros' .
There have been photocopies.
There have been euros produced with scanners, but which are enormously different from the real euro and, consequently, these concerns, which are occasionally expressed, should no longer be an issue.
The euro has an extremely high security factor, unlike some of the world' s other national high circulation currencies, and this should guarantee that this type of situation is not going to occur.
I would also deny the truth of some of the assertions made about the functioning of ATMs.
There have indeed been practical problems.
Anyone who goes to automated toll booths machines not far from here will see that some machines do not work with the currencies of every Union country.
These are practical problems, whose importance we should not exaggerate: they are merely anecdotes within an enormously important and complex process.
Nor do I feel that there are major pricing problems or that prices in the sales will influence prices in January, as they have not done in the past, since they have never been taken into account.
Last week, speaking with the former chairman of Ecofin, Mr Reynders, we said that the clear lesson we have learned from this process is that the next time we change currency we must not do it on the first of January.
But since I am sure that this situation will not arise, I would say that we have no need to worry about this problem either.
Ladies and gentlemen, many thanks for your immense cooperation during this period.
It has been crucial to helping the good work of the Member States, to ensuring that the public has been better informed and also to providing encouragement for the Commission' s work.
The debate is closed.
Procurement
The next item is the joint debate on the following:
Report (A5-0378/2001) by ZappalÃ , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the coordination of procedures for the award of public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts (COM(2000) 275 - C5-0367/2000 - 2000/0115(COD)) and
Report (A5-0379/2001) by ZappalÃ , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors (COM(2000) 276 - C5-0368/2000 - 2000/0117(COD)).
. (IT) Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating you on your election to the presidency of this House and I wish you and the entire House a successful two and a half years.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the time has come to vote on the directive on public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts and the directive on specific sectors - entities operating in the water, energy and transport sectors - in plenary.
The Commission worked on them for four years, conducting a series of hearings, studies and assessments. Then Parliament worked on them for a further two years.
A very well-attended public hearing took place and the Committee of the Regions, trade associations and professionals from all over Europe were also consulted.
The fact that such a huge amount of work has been necessary should not surprise us, considering that public works contracts take up around 15% of the Union' s total GDP, that is over EUR 1 500 billion.
It is estimated that only 20% of that sum is actually covered by the provisions of the current directives in that the threshold above which it is mandatory to apply them is relatively high and, in any case, more or less equal to that laid down in the agreements for the participation of third countries.
The current directives are now outdated and therefore need revising and bringing into line with new technologies and new market trends.
It was precisely the need to increasingly develop the internal market which prompted the Commission to research and propose the directives in question.
The subject is of considerable importance and could not and still must not be treated lightly.
In addition to individual Members, four Parliamentary committees delivering opinions and the committee responsible - the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - examined the texts and tabled amendments: almost more than half this House has been able to examine, debate and amend the texts.
It is a simple matter to summarise the contents: they revise and modernise the current directives, they introduce electronic auctions; they clarify the standards on technical specifications, they define rules on award criteria, they simplify the thresholds and they introduce a Common Procurement Vocabulary.
Overall, the proposals deserve our support and, indeed, have it: we are all aware of how important they are and we all want their path to be smooth.
However, the most significant past and present problems which have emerged and which are the subject of debate within the different political groupings, and between the groupings and between national representatives need to be highlighted.
The thresholds, or the value below which the directives are not binding. This value, which - as I have said - is already relatively high, corresponds, however, to the value laid down in the agreements with third countries, in line with the Commission' s proposal.
