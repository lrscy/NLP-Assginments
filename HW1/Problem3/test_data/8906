(NL) Mr President, the Turkish Government has stated that it will not yield to what it itself describes as the pressure on the part of the Cypriots to get Ankara to take so-called unilateral measures in order to solve the problems between Turkey and Nicosia.
It appears that the European Union, to which Turkey is so keen to belong, has caved in to the pressure from Cyprus.
The Turkish Government has now made it known that it will not be taking so-called unilateral measures, in other words, it will not meet us halfway in the agreements contained in the Ankara Protocol concerning Cyprus.
I do hope that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, the European Council will seize the opportunity to cross the T's and dot the I's, because this is not about unilateral measures, but about a situation that is perfectly clear and can be summed up in a few sentences.
The fact is that it is unacceptable that a candidate Member State that has held a piece of territory belonging to another EU Member State under illegal military occupation for more than 30 years should become a Member of this Union and - as if that were not enough - should consider it fair to pass the buck to the victim, for this is what this situation amounts to.
The fact that Erdogan refuses to open up Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot ships is only a logical consequence of Turkey's imperialist attitude towards Cyprus.
The negotiations should not just be suspended, they should be broken off indefinitely.
(FR) Mr President, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, Mr Barroso, Mr Barroso recently mentioned the fact that it would be unwise to proceed with further enlargements without settling the institutional issue.
The institutional mechanisms already no longer allow the Union to function satisfactorily.
This is particularly the case as regards European immigration policy, badly managed as it is as a result of the unanimity rule.
Giving the impression that one is going for broke means quite simply running the risk of endangering the European Union.
If the enlargement process is to be completed with the support of the European people, it is crucial that they are shown the need for appropriate institutions to be put in place.
The issue of the never-ending enlargement of a Europe without defined borders was an important factor in the 'No' vote when the Constitutional Treaty was rejected.
Providing the European Union with a geographical and political framework would appear to be a prerequisite for allowing the people to take back Europe for themselves.
As regards Turkey, I note the decision taken by the Council to partially suspend the negotiations on eight of the thirty-five chapters.
Nevertheless, I feel that this is an inadequate measure given that Turkey has not respected its commitments regarding the Ankara Protocol.
I therefore believe that these negotiations should be suspended in their entirety.
It is unthinkable that Turkey should still not acknowledge the existence of an EU Member State, namely Cyprus, which it has partly occupied for more than 30 years.
Finally, I must emphasise integration capacity.
This capacity is not inexhaustible.
Moreover, it must become an enlargement criterion, even if we were told otherwise by the Finnish Presidency this morning.
We need to act responsibly faced with this key issue of Europe's borders.
On the subject of climate change, I would say this: it is a matter of urgency, it is the major challenge of this century, it requires a universal commitment and any differences must be overcome.
We need to convince the other economic powers, too, and make them want to support us.
In short, we expect a strong signal from this European Council and, above all, no waffle!
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whenever a presidency's term of office ends, it makes me think of the cry 'the King is dead; long live the King'.
After the Finnish Presidency, which has put in a creditable performance, Europe is preparing to work under the new King, the Queen, by whom I mean Mrs Merkel.
The presidencies succeed one another; the problems remain.
As from next year, the Union will be represented by 27 commissioners and 785 MEPs: this is clearly an inflationist process, which disrupts the running of our institutions.
I have always worked for the enlargement of the Union.
Europe has never been destined to remain an exclusive club for Christian nations.
For that reason, Turkey must be given a credible prospect of accession.
Turkey is part of our history, of our common culture: the Iliad took place in the so-called 'Asian' part of Turkey.
Europe needs a democratic and secular Turkey to act as a link between the different cultures of the Mediterranean basin.
However, before we enlarge again, if only towards Croatia, our Union must reform itself, must change its structures and the way in which it operates.
It was a serious political mistake to proceed with successive enlargements without first strengthening the institutions.
The Treaty of Nice is just a patch-up.
Even though Finland has just ratified it, the Constitution seems to be in limbo.
The Union's budget is woeful.
The financial perspective is nothing like what it was supposed to be.
The Union needs own resources quickly if it is to tackle our economic, social and environmental challenges.
Viewed from the outside, Europe seems to be a kind of heaven on earth, which explains the high number of potential immigrants, of both the legal and illegal kind.
Yet, the people of Europe are familiar with the Union's shortcomings and expect real political decisions from their leaders, not just the kind of talk that promises a great deal, but delivers little.
Will the Finnish Presidency be able to finish on a high note?
There is room for doubt.
Mr President, I hope the European Council will express its condemnation of the Holocaust Conference - or, more accurately, the 'Holocaust Denial Conference' - just held in Iran.
I appreciate the fact that the President of Parliament did just that this morning.
It is essential that the European Union makes clear at the highest level - that of the assembled Prime Ministers - its opposition to this outrageous exercise in mischief and hate.
On enlargement, it is very disheartening that some EU countries and some MEPs seem able to contemplate Turkey only in negative terms of doom and gloom.
In fact, Turkish accession would be a great asset for the EU.
Of course, there are difficulties and Turkey does have legal obligations it is not fulfilling, but it might help if the Council also fulfilled its political pledge to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.
The European Council also needs to fulfil its commitment to keep the door open to the Balkan countries.
On making the EU more effective in law enforcement, the draft European Council conclusions are an exercise in contortion.
They start by emphasising, quite rightly, that our citizens want concrete results on cross-border crime and terrorism and that the EU is failing to respond adequately.
But they end only by confirming the principles of the Constitutional Treaty - which is great, but gives us no medium-term solution.
The fact that the Council could not agree a prisoner transfer measure because of a veto by one Member State just adds to the long list of failures and inaction.
The criminals are laughing all the way to the bank.
Finally, a word about extraordinary rendition, torture flights and secret prisons.
I can but dream of a united European Council enjoining each of the Member States to carry out a thorough examination into possible complicity.
Maybe there would be more of a chance of such an outcome if the Council did not treat the European Parliament's temporary committee with such disdain.
In its 2006 Human Rights Report, presumably produced under the authority of Council Secretary-General Javier Solana, it says: 'The EP carried out an inquiry led by Mr Dick Marty', but Mr Dick Marty led the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly's inquiry!
If Mr Solana cannot even bother to distinguish between the two bodies, perhaps our draft final report description of him as 'uncooperative' can be considered justified.
(NL) Mr President, the Finnish Presidency has taken the initiative to hold secret discussions with all Member States about what they want to do with the Constitution, the outcome of which will be discussed during the forthcoming Summit.
There is not one legitimate reason why such discussions could not be held in public.
It is now apparently the intention, since the Constitution has been shot down in public debates in the Netherlands and France, to force this document through in backrooms.
During the Dutch elections a month ago, it was only the parties opposed to the European Constitution that were successful.
According to opinion polls, even more Dutch people are now reported to be opposed to the Constitution.
The fact that the Council, the Commission and this House appear unable to accept this reality is a scandal that will continue to undermine the EU's reputation.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to send a strong message to the participants of the European Council, which begins tomorrow.
The message can be summed up in a single word: solidarity.
Europe needs to show solidarity with my country and with other post-Communist countries, to show solidarity in its diplomatic relations and solidarity on energy issues.
It needs to have a clear and decisive position with respect to Russia.
This position should first and foremost reflect the interests of Europeans, and not of the Russia Federation.
I have the fortune to be speaking in this house today, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the shameful declaration of martial law in Poland.
I lived under Communism for forty years, I was active in the underground movement and it is hardly surprising that I do not trust Russia.
Europe now faces a serious test. The outcome will show whether we can count on its support in issues which are so difficult for us.
(DE) Mr President, it almost hurts to see the Finnish Presidency of the Council, still spending hours in this place, having now spent half a year sitting there, familiar with the mantras of politics and of its customary to-and-fro, sometimes listening, sometimes not, and sometimes hearing things when nothing has been said.
I have a simple request to make of them, speaking as one who, like many millions of Europeans, is predisposed to look favourably on their country.
I ask them to consider once more what, over this past six months, was, in their eyes, the main problem, one on which the Germans may perhaps be able to make progress, perhaps a word, a sentence, solidarity, the constitution, subsidiarity, or bureaucracy, but it should be brief and to the point.
It should be a message. Perhaps that would help us make a little bit of progress.
Mr President, if we are describing the changes in our societies in the European Union as threats, of course the citizens will listen and be afraid.
I am surprised to see that my Danish colleague Mr Rasmussen is not here, considering his comments earlier.
However, if we describe the changes we are making as a way of meeting the challenges we face - the global challenge and security threats - that is another matter.
I believe that one of the responsibilities of the Finnish Presidency and of the Commission is to underline what we have achieved this autumn under the Finnish Presidency.
We have a new seventh Framework Programme, we have finalised our decision-making with regard to REACH and the Services Directive.
That is a change of some magnitude and it is making Europe better.
We have prepared enlargement for Romania and Bulgaria and have appointed new Commissioners.
Slovenia will enter the euro cooperation.
It is a significant moment in the development of the European Union.
Does that make Europe worse?
Does that make people feel threatened?
Of course not.
It makes Europe better for its citizens.
That is the situation.
If we say that clearly and loudly people will also see the rationality of the changes we are making.
That should be the responsibility not only of Mr Rasmussen but also of the European Council and the summit meeting.
Regarding enlargement, let us say loudly and clearly that we are laying down tough criteria while making it credible that those who fulfil them can be members.
The Presidency should lay the groundwork for a new policy with Russia - firm but open, open but firm.
We need Russia for energy security but we also need to apply stringent rules and a firm policy regarding democracy and respect for fundamental human rights.
That is the way it should be and that is what we should hope for in this final meeting with the Finnish Presidency.
You have done a good job and you can do even better in the coming days.
(NL) Mr President, a few weeks ago, Commissioner Rehn said that he did not want a repeat of the Turkey Summit in 2004-2005, and from that point of view, last Monday's Council meeting was a great success.
The European Ministers reached agreement about suspending talks on a number of negotiation chapters.
This decision is in line with the Commission's recommendation, which our group had already welcomed.
It sends a clear message to Turkey to the effect that the implementation of the Ankara Agreement is a non-negotiable part of the accession process, and that failure to implement the additional Protocol fully will inevitably have consequences for the progress of the negotiation process.
There has never been any doubt about this, and we would therefore ask the Turkish Government to adopt a more constructive stance in this matter.
At the same time, the Council decision makes it clear that the negotiation process can, and indeed must, go on.
It is of the utmost importance that the channels of communication be kept open, and a constructive stance will be required from both sides to ensure that the accession process is not delayed or does not completely degenerate into mutual distrust.
So there will be no Turkey Summit, but I hope that the leaders who will be present tomorrow and the day after will nevertheless realise that the door to Turkey is, and should remain, open and that the Commission and Council will need to make an extra effort to do something about the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.
Any progress in that area will also help get the Ankara Protocol issue back on track.
(PL) Mr President, the forthcoming European Council summit will, to a certain extent, mark the official start of the German Presidency.
We all know that we have high hopes for this particular presidency.
Today, the list of issues the Union needs to tackle is already so long that it will certainly take more than six months to get through it.
That is why it is a cause for concern that one of the issues to be discussed at the European Union summit is the unfortunate constitutional treaty, which was pronounced dead and buried in the French and Dutch referenda.
No one is still brave enough to return to the first version of the treaty and instead there is talk of taking individual chapters from the draft and of presenting our citizens with some sort of watered-down treaty.
Instead of providing specific answers to questions relating to the further development of the continent, the peoples of Europe can instead look forward to another serving of newspeak.
No amount of linguistic acrobatics can hide the fact that the French and the Dutch people clearly stated their opposition to the draft constitution.
They were opposed to the idea of a centralised European superstate.
The European Council summit and, by extension, the German presidency, should send a clear message to the peoples of the Member States that their will, and the previously established rules, are being respected.
(ES) Mr President, the truth is that reality, any kind of reality, cannot be constructed by simply narrating and evoking the past.
If we do not have a clear view of our projects and our possibilities, Mr President, we will not be able to build the future or understand the past.
I am therefore pleased that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council is aware that its role is to try to bring together wills and forge consensuses so that the European Union project can move forward.
However, that is a necessary but insufficient condition, because we need all of the institutions to be operating harmoniously.
Within this context, I believe that we should welcome the fact that the Council of General Affairs Ministers has decided that the next three Presidencies - the German, Portuguese and Slovenian Presidencies - should draw up a strategic plan.
Presidencies-in-Office of the Council come and go, however, Mr President, but the Commission remains.
The Commission must therefore be closely involved in this strategic plan of the next three Presidencies and it must also be closely involved in the preparations for the European Councils.
It is very reassuring to hear the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso's, message regarding the future of Europe, the internal dimension and external projection, the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the progress yet to be made in the fields of security, freedom and justice.
Mr President, I believe that each institution must play its due role according to the balance laid down in the Treaties, but I believe that it is essential to restore the harmonious partnership, the strategic alliance, between Parliament and the Commission, which has allowed us to achieve so much progress and success in the European Union and which should allow the European Union to awake from what some say is a state of lethargy, of institutional siesta, and take a decisive step in the right direction.
(FR) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, some great European events have taken place in Helsinki.
My impression, however, at a time when you are about to hand over the baton to the German Presidency, is that your own Presidency will not figure prominently in anyone's mind, given the problems that still loom. In the end, however, these problems are the responsibility not of one Presidency but of all of us.
We need to pull ourselves together and relaunch the European project.
From this point of view, the debate we have had in this House on absorption capacity - the subject on which we have just voted - is, I believe, fundamental.
It again poses questions about how effective and democratic the European Union is and about its financial capacity.
I hope that, when you hand over the baton to the German Presidency, these issues will be clearly set out so that, in the near future, we might get Europe back on track again and, above all, enable our fellow Europeans to see Europe as the solution rather than as the problem.
If we are to do those things, two issues need to be dealt with carefully.
Firstly, there is the issue of the internal market.
I am familiar with the zealots of the internal market for whom that market means nothing more than the free movement of services, goods and capital.
Without a social model or a social dimension and without a directive on public services, the internal market will serve only those who are strongest and richest and will militate against what our fellow Europeans expect of the European Union.
Secondly, there is the energy issue.
In this area too, I have had experience of those who fervently advocate market liberalisation as the only solution to all the difficulties with which we are familiar.
That is a rather limited view of things. The fact is, we also need to raise the issues of research, taxation, interconnections and geostrategy, and I know that, on these points, you have clear views, Madam President.
Be firm at the European Council so that we might make progress in this area.
Take heart!
Mr President, it is obvious that the European Union has two major headaches today: one is the Constitutional Treaty and the other is enlargement.
On the issue of the Constitutional Treaty, we have to admit that we did not make much of it - we failed to achieve positive and tangible results.
We have to work harder so that we will soon have a constitutional charter for the European Union.
With regard to enlargement, unfortunately, whenever we speak about this, we refer to Turkey, and the situation is aggravated when we take into consideration the lenient position of the European Union towards Turkey.
We strongly support the Europeanisation of Turkey.
On the issue of the failure of Turkey to implement its commitments towards the European Union, we hope that Turkey will be made to understand that it was Turkey that applied for accession to the European Union and not the other way round.
We will have to wait and see.
The method of compromise is good, but, when it violates the boundaries of principles and values, it is bad.
Turkey has to get rid of the headache that is the Cyprus problem by allowing a fair solution acceptable to both communities, by withdrawing its forces and by ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots, because the cause of isolation is the occupation.
The European Union has to play a decisive role in finding a solution to the Cyprus problem based on European values and principles.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the pessimistic and even depressing opinions expressed by some previous speakers, I take the view that Europe has made considerable progress in the past six months under the Finnish Presidency.
Today in Parliament, for example, the pioneering REACH legislation has been adopted, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund has been set up, the Union has responded flexibly and effectively to the Lebanon crisis, and Romania and Bulgaria will join the family of EU Member States on 1 January.
Are these not, ladies and gentlemen, clear examples of progress and success, and evidence of the fact that, despite the huge challenges and problems the EU faces, it is capable of acting effectively?
Yes, the EU needs to make its decision-making mechanisms more effective and more flexible and to adopt the fundamental principles contained in the European Constitution, with which, let me remind you, all of the EU-25 governments have identified.
I should like to thank Finland not only for being the sixteenth country to adopt the Constitution but also for taking the debate on the future of the European Constitution further.
What we need now is also a clear position and clear statements from the leaders of countries like Poland, the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic that have yet to ratify the Treaty as regards what they want to do next with the document, when they will ratify it, and if they are not going to ratify it, what alternative solutions they are proposing.
I would like us to have such a statement this week at the EU summit in Brussels.
(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, today is not yet the time for a final assessment of what the Finnish Presidency of the Council achieved in the second half of 2006; that is something we will be able to do next week in the light of what emerges from the Summit.
I do believe, though, that we must not let go of one very striking point, something that has been a particular motivating force behind what we have been doing over the last few days, that being the question of what our attitude is towards ourselves and all the things we have brought into being over the last 50 years, and whether we are willing to justify them to those who are desirous of accession to the EU.
The reason why I say this with a great deal of passion is that I know from experience, especially from conversations with Turkey, that we may well use the same terminology, but actually mean quite different things.
For our own sakes, we must become clear in our own minds about what it is that unites us.
The impression I get from listening to this afternoon's debate is that we are a very colourful Christmas tree, under which everyone puts their presents, and, seeing their own there, like the rest of the tree as well, but that is not how Europe functions internally, and nor is it going to be successfully sold to the outside world on that basis.
Even now, I am hearing once more that, even though eight chapters have been put to one side during the negotiations with Turkey, another might be opened after all.
We will get nowhere if we do the things that ended up making matters difficult for us in the last enlargement round, that is to say if every presidency of the Council wants to outdo its predecessor in the number of chapters it manages either to open or to complete.
We must define for ourselves what we stand for and what unites us - I have just discovered that there is relatively little that unites me with Mrs BerÃšs - and that is something we now have to sort out internally if we are to be able to communicate it to the outside world.
That is the message that should go out from the December Summit and from the Finnish Presidency of the Council.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the President-in-Office on the way in which, with characteristic Finnish honesty but uncharacteristic Presidency bluntness, he has described the difficulties in the Council of getting Member States to agree on things, and how impossible it is to make progress in certain areas where we have unanimity.
It is very important that the EU delivers in areas like justice and home affairs and immigration policy, and we must ensure that we make progress for the benefit of our citizens.
I would hope that in areas where we have almost reached agreement, such as prisoner transfers and the possibility of a rapid response instrument for emergencies, we will be able to carry these through in a summit.
We can also apply the same principle to Member States in other areas as the Commission did yesterday in taking action about opening up energy markets and on economic reform.
Let us not lose sight of the importance of getting Member States to deliver on what they promised to do on the whole Lisbon Strategy.
However, enlargement is clearly the big issue.
We seem to have avoided a train crash with Turkey, but that does not guarantee the train is not going to come grinding to a halt, because if that train does come to a halt, the consequences will be very severe not only for the European Union but also for the Balkans.
We must move ahead with enlargement.
We must not become distracted by things like absorption capacity, because we all know that if Norway wanted to join, nobody would want to talk about absorption capacity.
It is a code word for something else.
Let us make progress on enlargement; let us keep the show on the road.
(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too shall focus on the major issue of enlargement, which has again predominated recently.
First of all it is clear that the European Union must keep its promises.
Consequently, the promise we gave of European prospects both to Turkey and to Croatia and the other countries in the Western Balkans cannot be revoked.
It is likewise clear that the integration capacity of the European Union is a serious factor which should be taken into account by all the members.
There can be no enlargement if it has an adverse effect on the cohesion of the Union and its efficacy in preparing and implementing policies.
This is in the interest not only of the European Union but also of the candidate countries.
This being so and irrespective of the sanctions which will be imposed in the event of non-compliance, it is in the interest of all the candidate countries not to demonstrate a position of filibustering or constant procrastination when it comes to complying with the negotiated framework.
This framework is defined by the European Union, not by them.
Progress by the candidate countries in honouring their European obligations may well be a painful process, but it is also the only opportunity for them to modernise and, as such, they must deal with it.
Finally, let us not forget the Union's constitutional problem, which is still unresolved.
It is clear that further enlargement of the Union cannot be attempted if this problem is not successfully resolved first, because a European Union which is not functional is very simply unable to accept new Member States.
(NL) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I cannot imagine that the Council would not say anything about the restructuring exercise at Volkswagen's Vorst plant.
Restructuring exercises are becoming increasingly more common and the decision by Volkswagen is a harsh one that will, either directly or indirectly, plunge thousands of families into uncertainty.
I think that Europe can lend a hand not just via structural funds or a globalisation fund, but I think that the Commission should also monitor those exercises.
Were the trade unions consulted on time?
I think that this can certainly not be said in the case of Volkswagen.
Is the restructuring exercise based on economic motives, or did other national motives come into it?
The Volkswagen Vorst plant is the second most productive site.
It is correct that the automotive sector is producing in excess of requirement, but I think that it is exactly at those times that a real industrial policy is called for.
CARS 21 is an initial step, although it strikes me as far from adequate.
(ES) Mr President, I shall focus on two issues concerning the forthcoming European Council.
Firstly, enlargement.
Enlargement has been and remains a success for the European Union: it has brought benefits in political and economic terms and it has strengthened Europe's role in the world.
I am convinced that it will be positive for Bulgaria and Romania.
The fifth enlargement has demonstrated the so-called 'transforming power of the Union', which has stimulated profound and positive political, economic and social changes in countries that until recently were under the Communist yoke, but since enlargement has been a success story, that story must be properly told.
I therefore support the Commission in terms of the importance it attaches to communication.
That is to say, the citizens must be made more aware of its benefits.
I hope that the forthcoming European Council will also be aware of it.
I also support the idea of conditionality.
The candidate countries must fulfil their commitments and carry out the necessary reforms.
Naturally, throughout the process, we must take account of the Union's capacity to integrate all of these countries.
Furthermore, the enlargement process cannot carry on indefinitely; I therefore also agree with the Commission's idea of consolidation.
The other issue is immigration.
In my country, illegal immigration is unfortunately an extremely topical issue.
Mr President, I would like to insist that illegal immigration must be a central issue in the Union's relations with third countries.
I am pleased that, during the Finnish Presidency, the European Union has held ministerial meetings on immigration and development with African countries in Rabat and Tripoli, but we must move on from final conclusions to actions.
For example, it is essential that we sign re-admission agreements.
That is unfortunately a long way away.
For how many years has the Commission been negotiating the re-admission agreement with Morocco, and the one with the ACP countries?
We have the Cotonou Agreement but, despite its Article 13, neither re-admissions nor re-admission agreements are making any progress.
I am also rather concerned about the optimism I have heard expressed about the situation of Frontex.
Mr President, illegal immigration is a very serious problem, with far-reaching consequences, and a space without borders, such as Schengen, affects all of us.
We must act in a firm and determined fashion in order to ensure that the statements and commitments repeated at so many ministerial conferences are turned into realities.
The forthcoming European Council must promote this objective decisively.
(MT) Mr President, I too will be speaking about immigration.
In fact, to be fair, I think we should say that this year could go down as the year during which Europe finally started to face reality with regard to the issue of illegal immigration.
It has been a year during which Europe has realised that Southern European countries cannot be left to face this problem on their own, a very different proposition from the 'doors' and 'windows' mentioned by Mr Cohn-Bendit.
In fact, we have started to witness the inception of common action: short-term measures that are just as necessary as long-term measures.
For the first time, we have seen European patrols in the Mediterranean Sea as well as in the Atlantic.
Next year, these patrols must not only be continued, but also strengthened and extended throughout all the months during which we are vulnerable.
Thanks to this Parliament, we have seen a bigger budget allocated to the Frontex agency, which has a crucial role in this sphere.
Moreover, tomorrow we will be voting on four new funds, among which is a European fund aimed specifically at strengthening external borders.
This is something we must do if we want the flow to decrease.
I expect these funds to be used in an effective manner as from this January.
It is encouraging that these funds will have an emergency clause so that assistance can be given immediately in cases of emergency.
Moreover, at the end of November the Commission, which I congratulate, announced new proposals designed to strengthen external maritime borders in Southern Europe.
These proposals include the establishment of a network of coastal patrols and of the European system for frontier surveillance.
I congratulate the Commission on these proposals.
Therefore, during discussions about immigration, European governments must show the necessary political will and solidarity, so that we can proceed on the road we have finally embarked on - the right way.
Moreover, if, during this year we have finally started facing reality, next year must be the year during which we can prove clearly that when we work together we can meet even the most difficult challenges.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President of the Commission on the good team spirit and control he has in his cabinet because it seems they have to have colour-coordinated ties.
I think that is very good - it shows that they have things under control!
This European Council is about three things.
I thought that the Socialists were against product placement, and I can tell Mia De Vits that this summit is not about Volkswagen, it is about three things: enlargement; the Constitution; and justice and home affairs.
What do I think the key message for enlargement should be?
It should be threefold: first, we need to continue our commitment to enlargement.
If we get that into the conclusions I think it is a success.
Second, I think that integration capacity should be defined but it should not be a condition for enlargement.
If you get that through, I think it would be very good.
Third, I think we need a little more public debate on enlargement and, certainly, on public defence.
Right now, we have a political leadership in many countries that first takes a decision on enlargement and, right after it has done that, starts blaming enlargement for all the bad that we have in the world.
I do not think that is the right way to go about it.
Second, the Constitution.
As a former civil servant, I understand the necessity for confidential consultations.
Nevertheless, it would be nice if you could throw some light on what those consultations would lead to.
I would also like to thank the Finnish Presidency and Finland for ratifying the Constitution. I think that was a very important step and an important gesture.
There is a lot of debate about the Constitution right now.
I, personally, am against the idea of a mini-treaty.
I would like to have a 'treaty plus' - in other words a second edition of the Treaty.
If we achieve that in 2008 or 2009 I think that would be quite good.
Finally, justice and home affairs.
I am sick and tired of hearing people say that we cannot advance on this thing because of the Constitution.
No - we decided in Amsterdam to move to qualified majority voting, we reinforced that in Nice and we did it with the Constitution.
If we have the political will - and this goes straight to the German Government - we can move to qualified majority voting in all justice and home affairs questions.
I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for a job very well done.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, thank you for this excellent debate and the comments and counsel the Presidency has received during the discussions.
In my opening speech I did not go any deeper into the enlargement debate, nor will I now, because we discussed this in the House very thoroughly this morning.
It is one of the European Council's main concerns, but we debated the details in our sitting earlier today.
In several speeches, questions about a social Europe arose.
Let me remind you, however, that at the informal summit at Lahti there was also a social summit, and as President Barroso mentioned, this autumn a decision on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund was reached.
We in Finland are in the habit of reminding ourselves that you first have to create prosperity for it to be shared, and that is why there was so much attention paid to innovation and competitiveness policy during the Finnish presidential term.
Regarding immigration, the Union is specifically aiming at a comprehensive debate on immigration issues, and this the European Council intends to confirm in its discussions at the weekend.
It is comprehensive in the sense that it will not be exclusively about border control or just about illegal immigration.
It will also be a tremendous opportunity to discuss legal immigration.
In the summer and this autumn we organised two conferences with our African partners on this, so that we might examine the root causes of illegal immigration in particular and get to grips with them over the long term.
It is well worth endorsing the work of Frontex, but that is just a small slice of the whole issue of immigration policy.
As for Galileo, there is no decision on its location in sight in the European Council, and there are no plans to discuss it.
I would remind members from the new Member States that we sometimes need painstaking effort to establish EU agencies.
Finland has been a Member State since 1995, and with the adoption today of the Chemicals Regulation by the European Parliament, Finland now is to have its first European Union agency, after more than 10 years of membership.
I would like to thank Parliament for that.
Finally, I would like to return to the debate on the Constitutional Treaty.
We have to remember that the bilateral consultations engaged in by the Finnish Presidency are due to the conclusions of the June European Council, which gave Germany the task of reporting on the situation regarding the Constitution for the European Council next spring.
The report, however, needs to be based on very intensive consultations with the Member States.
We have now got through the first round of consultations.
It was done in a spirit of trust, which is why very little information on it was or is being made public, because the intention is for the German Presidency to be able to continue the work, based on our analysis, and then produce a report for the European Council.
As has appeared evident from this debate, everyone seems to have an idea about what others think.
We all seem to know very well what people think in different countries.
Our round of consultations was an attempt to discuss directly and specifically with governments how they see the situation, and to look for possible ways to proceed.
It is still not the time for a decision, however, and not even the time for negotiations.
This has simply been an opportunity to hear people's opinions, and there are only very tentative conclusions to be drawn.
If the situation had to be described in one word, as one of the Members of Parliament suggested, I would describe it using the word 'reform'.
We have broad consensus on the need for reform, and now we are deliberating on how we can proceed and what sort of reform there should be.
Mr President, as this is my last appearance in plenary, apart from question time which follows soon, I would like to thank the European Parliament personally and on behalf of the Presidency for its very diverse, even kaleidoscopic, but always excellent cooperation.
(Applause)
There is no doubt that, despite naturally differing views, this debate has revealed areas of firm consensus, which I would like to highlight because some of them are important.
We are looking to build a new consensus on the enlargement and, let us be frank, the Turkey issue is a sensitive one that strongly divides public opinion in our countries.
The fact that the Commission's proposal - supported by the Finnish Presidency and formulated in close cooperation with the Finnish Presidency at every stage - obtained unanimous support from the Member States via their Foreign Ministers was crucial because we could have had a very serious problem on our hands today.
On an issue as sensitive and delicate as this, we have succeeded in achieving a position that we consider to be balanced, credible and fair, and today it obtained a resounding majority among the Members of this House who had their say.
We will now hopefully be able to hold a proper strategic discussion on enlargement.
I should like to underline Mr Stubb's remarks, which I found highly pertinent.
It is vital that European leaders at all levels, not just the Heads of State or Government, including the European Parliament and others in positions of political authority at national level, hold a serious debate on the issue of the enlargement, regardless of whether or not Europe sees enlargement as a great opportunity, which is precisely what enlargement represents for Europe, politically, economically and culturally, and I would even say historically.
For this to happen it was important to 'cleanse' this debate of the most difficult issues that were on the table so that we could focus on the important business.
I hope the Council marks this new consensus.
We need it and we need to have the courage to debate, with our citizens, what enlargement represents.
Earlier today I was in Berlin, taking part in an interview with Chancellor Merkel on a popular German television programme, in which the public asked us questions such as how much Germany stands to lose from enlargement and what companies would leave.
My job was to explain that, for example, Germany is profiting hugely from enlargement; that enlargement is helping create jobs in Germany; that Germany went from EUR 17 billion in exports to what are now the new Member States in 1994 to around EUR 80 billion this year; that Germany exports more to the new Member States than it imports; and that enlargement is creating, rather than destroying jobs in the EU-15.
The enlargement has been positive for the EU, and this, in my view, has been the main contribution of the Council.
Let us work to achieve a new consensus on the enlargement.
I do not intend to go over the other issues that were explained so well by Mrs LehtomÃ€ki.
I should like to express my thanks for the positive spirit of collaboration we have enjoyed with the Finnish Presidency and I would add, in response to a question raised, if I remember rightly, by Mrs Ludford - because this issue was not mentioned in my first speech - that the Commission vehemently condemns this so-called conference on the holocaust held in Teheran.
If it were not so tragic, it would be laughable.
It is wrong to insult the memory of so many victims of the holocaust in this way.
On this issue too, we need to uphold a position of principle.
The debate is closed.
Written Statements (Rule 142)
I am astonished that several Members have focused on their opposition to the Constitutional treaty in their contribution to this debate, although the matter is not on the agenda of this Council, but of the one to be held in June.
Nor is it right for them to say that the issue is dead, having been 'rejected'.
It hasn't.
It has been rejected by 2 countries and accepted by 18, with the remainder waiting to see what happens.
What we have is not rejection, but divergence.
It is quite right for the European Council to try to overcome that divergence, taking account both of the views of the minority that rejected the treaty and of the majority who support it.
To claim that the current treaties should forever remain unamended because of the rejection of this treaty by France and the Netherlands is untenable.
(PT) As we all know, as social problems in the EU pile up, there is ever greater pressure to pursue neoliberal policies, and the disastrous problems we know are associated with those policies, namely unemployment, precarious work, poverty and social inequality.
What emerges, on the other hand, is an emphasis on immigration policy, and an attempt to increase the implementation of qualified majority voting, on the pretext of facilitating policy in this area, whereas the real intention is to implement more securitarian measures.
Similarly, there is increased focus on institutional issues, in an attempt to relaunch the so-called European Constitution.
It is symptomatic that in meetings with representatives of future presidencies, such as Germany, the institutional question always rises to the top of the agenda, closely followed by the completion of the internal market, and the issue of energy.
Equally symptomatic is the way in which social and environmental issues are played down and no mention is made of reviewing the status and guidelines of the European Central Bank, in spite of the dire consequences of its policy on the most fragile economies, families and micro-, small and medium sized enterprises.
(PT) Just a couple of comments in the 200 words available to me ...
Perhaps the most important aspect relating to enlargement is the reaffirmation of the need to comply with UN resolutions on Cyprus and not to manipulate the Cyprus question in the context of the contradictions surrounding Turkey's accession to the EU.
As regards the so-called 'constitutional process', the proposals are clear and the contradictions are still there.
While the need to relaunch the 'European Constitution' has been reaffirmed, we now hear of a consensus that is 'less' ambitious but delivers the core elements.
They speak of a name change and of a (pseudo) 'mini-agreement', with the accent placed on institutional issues (on the pretext that the EU needs to function, but in reality guaranteeing that the major powers dominate the decision-making process) and on what is termed 'the EU's role in the world' (in other words its militarisation and foreign interventionism).
There are even those who say that if we 'sell' the idea of such a (pseudo) 'mini-agreement', referendums will not need to be held in some Member States.
This 'mini-Treaty' would take the thrust of the content of the 'European Constitution', and give the impression that it is actually something different.
In other words, this is another attempt to (re)impose the rejected Treaty, and the Portuguese Presidency will be given this particularly unacceptable task in the second half of 2007.
Council Question Time
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many of the decisions taken by the European Union have a direct or indirect effect on children's lives.
Examples of this are laws on social protection, the job market, health, justice and gender equality.
The harmonisation of family policy, work and family life and the promotion and preservation of good working conditions are also crucial to the welfare of children and families.
These and other matters were on the agenda at the informal meeting in early July of the EU Ministers for Employment, Social Affairs and Health.
Measures that are effective and taken as early on as possible to eliminate poverty and social exclusion enhance the welfare of children and families with children.
Last March the European Council stressed the need for action to eliminate child poverty, and this was also discussed at the Fifth European Round Table on Poverty and Social Exclusion held in mid-October.
The subject was also included in the National Strategy Reports on Social Protection and Social Inclusion produced by the Member States for the Commission in September.
The harmonisation of work with family life is a major challenge in a changing job market.
Child welfare means that both parents have to be responsible for the everyday life of the family.
The Finnish Presidency has made fatherhood and the more equal involvement of men in family life the subject of debate.
At the start of October a conference of experts was organised called 'Men and Gender Equality', and in December the Council's conclusions were adopted on it.
During the Finnish Presidency the Commission forwarded a communication on children's rights.
This was discussed by various working groups in the Council and the Permanent Intergovernmental Group L'Europe de l'enfance, which is made up of high-ranking officials with responsibility for child and family policy in the Member States.
During the Finnish presidential term, the Council has worked hard on the proposal to establish the DAFNE III Programme.
This programme could also be used to finance some of the measures mentioned in the communication on children's rights.
The aim is for Parliament and the Council to take a joint decision before the end of the year on the basis of political consensus reached on this in the December Council.
Finally, let me mention that Finland organised an open seminar on pre-school education towards the end of November in Helsinki.
It is therefore probably true to say that during the Finnish Presidency the Council of Ministers has been active in several of those areas of policy that are closely linked to children's welfare.
The Presidency is itself also responsible for several important initiatives relating to children and families.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to thank the Minister for her update and detailed presentation of all actions, of both the Presidency and the Commission.
I trust that the same efforts will be continued by the next Presidency, so that we achieve results.
I have no supplementary question.
Mr President, in the work of the Council we strive to preserve continuity in all areas of policy.
The Finnish Presidency has worked very closely in various areas of policy with Germany, the next country to hold the presidency, and I am confident that the good policies will continue and strengthen during the next presidency too.
(DE) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, we know that most workers are employed in family firms.
Family-friendly business plans exist.
Do you intend to pursue these further and do you believe that proposals could also be submitted relating to the tax treatment of families?
Mr President, tax incentives can also be used to harmonise work with family life more successfully, but, as the honourable Member must know, the harmonisation of taxation at EU level is still rather limited.
It is nonetheless important that, while we ponder these questions, one of the criteria is surely the family-friendly view.
(ES) Madam President, the welfare of children in the European Union is still facing certain difficulties, but they have been more or less resolved.
However, what happens to children who are in the European Union but are not its citizens?
There is international legislation making it obligatory to protect these children, but in some regions numbers of immigrant children have been accumulating because they cannot be returned to their countries of origin, and regional or local authorities have to take responsibility for them.
Has the Council considered the possibility of taking any measures with regard to immigrant children within the European Union?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Hague Programme for strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union, which was approved in November 2004, and the related Council and Commission action plan of 2005 both establish a framework within which to develop an EU policy on legal immigration.
Under the Hague programme, the vital role of legal immigration in, for example, enhancing the Union's economic development, is already recognised.
At the same time, the programme states that it falls within the competence of the Member States to decide on numbers of legal immigrants.
With this in mind, the Commission intends to submit for approval several proposals for acts set out in the action policy programme on legal immigration adopted in January 2006.
The first of these is a proposal for a general framework directive whose main purpose would be to guarantee common rights for all nationals of third countries who already work legally in a Member State but who do not as yet have the right to long-term residency status in the EU.
In addition, the Commission will submit four separate proposals for a directive with reference to those groups of workers which the Member States generally need.
These proposals apply to immigration and residency requirements for highly trained workers, immigration and residency requirements for seasonal workers, immigration and residency requirements for employed trainees, and the procedures for regulating the immigration of personnel sent by their company to another country temporarily, and temporary residency and stays in a country.
Another priority is better access to information on various aspects of immigration, the exchange of information on them, and the more effective dissemination of information.
New instruments are intended to be developed for this in the next few years.
There will be five of them in all, and the first is this year's European Year of Workers' Mobility, to be followed next year by the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
The second instrument is the EU's immigration portal, which is to be set up by the end of next year.
The third instrument is the interactive information system on Member State measures in matters of asylum and immigration.
The fourth instrument is the European migration network, and the fifth is the further development of the European Professional Mobility Portal and EURES Network, as they are considered able to promote the management of economic immigration.
With regard to the integration of nationals of third countries into the society of the host countries, which we spoke about in connection with the previous question, the Union aids integration policies in Member States by means of financial instruments, among which are preparatory measures on the integration of third-country nationals.
A newly allocated solidarity instrument within the framework of the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals, will give a new boost to integration policy in the Member States.
The aims of the fund relate to the challenges that crop up in integration and therefore complement measures under the European Social fund.
These aims are based on the Common Basic Principles on Integration adopted by the Council in November 2004.
(ES) Mr President, the number of questions presented on this issue demonstrates the current level of interest in immigration issues amongst us representatives of the peoples of Europe.
I would like specifically to thank the Finnish Presidency for the importance that it has attached to this issue.
My supplementary question is: does the Presidency believe that immigration is now a Community issue and that, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, it cannot remain in the hands of the States, but rather it must be in the hands of the European Union?
Specifically, does the Presidency-in-Office of the Council not believe that this is an appropriate time to apply the passerelle clause?
With regard to the previous question, it did not relate to immigrant children who are in Europe with their families, but rather to immigrant children who arrive in the European Union alone: nobody is dealing with them and the governments do not know what to do.
Mr President, when before question time we were discussing the agenda for this week's European Council, it was made very clear that the EU Heads of State or Government would also be discussing Union immigration policy this week.
In that sense it is becoming very much more a Community issue, because we believe that it would be very useful if we had common guidelines and basic principles relating to immigration policy.
As I said in my original speech, however, the Member States will consider, for example, volumes of legal immigration and how many people they want to take from their own point of view.
With regard to the 'passerelle' clause, to which the honourable Member refers, during a recent debate I described in detail how hard the Presidency had tried to make decision-making more efficient in justice and home affairs, but we did not succeed in this attempt.
(LT) Madam President, you mentioned that a directive is being prepared to encourage and regulate the migration of highly qualified specialists.
We have here, in the European Parliament, a Development Cooperation policy which seeks to improve life in countries from which people are migrating.
Do these policies and outlooks not clash?
We will invite qualified migrants into our countries, will not let them create wellbeing in their own countries but instead will use them to our advantage.
Mr President, first of all we should remember that it falls exclusively within the Commission's competence to make proposals for legislation, so the Council will not be working on this directive.
Instead, the Commission will draft it, although the Commission has not yet referred it to the legislative bodies.
The question of the status of trained workers is just the sort of matter where a very global approach to the European Union's immigration policy is required.
On the one hand, the Union is aiming to recruit to some extent highly trained people from developing countries for its own needs.
On the other hand, we must also admit and acknowledge that it will be harmful to the developing countries' own development if skilled human resources leave these countries.
Accordingly, it is important that these very sensitive issues are also discussed at Union level, and that they are also discussed with our partners, as was the case at the two conferences between the European Union and Africa in the last six months, at which these questions, which are very multilateral in nature, were tackled.
Mr President, I do not have a supplementary question.
I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that I am present for my own question, which you have already got tabled.
(DE) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, do you think it is helpful if European Member States unilaterally carry out as many as 1 million naturalisations over a short period, thereby, of course, setting a precedent for the others?
Is this one of the subjects that the European Council can and will discuss over the next few days?
Mr President, a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council to declare 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All was agreed in May.
It is the Commission's task to ensure that any forms of discrimination referred to in Article 13 of the Treaty are addressed and dealt with impartially.
All stakeholders are to be included in these measures.
The aim, under Article 2, is, firstly, to raise awareness of the right to equality and non-discrimination; secondly, to get those who have suffered discrimination more involved in society; thirdly, to increase respect for diversity and equality; and fourthly, to promote cohesiveness, by eliminating stereotypes, prejudice and violence.
To achieve the aims of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the action taken is to include various meetings and events, information, promotional and training campaigns, and Community or national surveys and studies.
Each Member State will be responsible for what it organises over the coming months.
To underline the importance of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, there will be an inaugural conference on it hosted by the forthcoming German Presidency in Berlin.
With regard to the European Year for Intercultural Dialogue, I would like to say that the Commission submitted a proposal for a decision on it to the European Parliament and the Council in October last year.
In the proposal for a decision's explanatory memorandum, it states that the experience gained from the organised projects next year, the European Year of Equal Opportunities, should be taken into account during the European Year for Intercultural Dialogue.
The Council's common position on the decision was adopted in mid-November and submitted to the European Parliament.
The proposal for a decision states that the priority task for the Member States and the Commission is to implement the projects and events planned.
It states that special attention should be paid to cooperation with the European Parliament.
The purpose is to encourage civil society and players at European, national and local level to activate both exchanges of experience and best practices.
The main target should be youth.
The challenge is how to bring intercultural dialogue into schools and colleges, work, leisure, cultural and sports centres, and civil society organisations.
deputising for the author. - I wish to thank the President-in-Office for that comprehensive answer, and would simply ask what plans there are to ensure the synergy between the two different years - 2007 and 2008 - so that a holistic approach is adopted and that they benefit one another and interact, rather than being organised totally separately.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency still believes that the High Level Dialogue meeting of the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on the fight against terrorism is of benefit in the promotion of openness and accountability in the strategy to combat terrorism in the EU.
The meeting on 10 May, during the Italian Presidency, was the last indication of this commitment.
With regard to the claim made in the question that the invitation was sent at the last minute, the Presidency wishes to point out that the President of the European Parliament was sent an official invitation on 10 April 2006.
It does not fall within the Presidency's competence to guess the reasons why it took so long to send an invitation to the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, but we are pleased that the Chairman of the Committee was nevertheless able to attend.
During its presidential term, Finland tried to honour its obligations under the strategy and organise this high-level event, but possible dates were always being cancelled before the invitation was sent, owing to one of the parties or because of some other major problem.
The Finnish Presidency regrets that it did not manage to organise the event, despite all its efforts to do so.
We hope that future presidencies will meet with more success in this, because regular contact needs to be maintained with the European Parliament on this important issue.
Thank you, Minister, but the fact is that second meeting did not take place, so one has to question the priority.
And to have the chairman of the committee at just one meeting in one year is really not very stunning.
We as the Parliament were not involved in the drawing up of this counter-terrorism strategy or in the action planned, despite repeated requests.
You were having discussions - we had a debate earlier this afternoon about the Automated Targeting System, which you knew about in September 2005, although you did not tell us.
If there really is a commitment to keep us informed of all important developments in the field of counter-terrorism, why did we not know about that?
Why are we not involved in all the discussions with the United States on security and privacy?
I beg to differ on your commitment to this dialogue.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, as I said, we worked hard to organise this High Level Dialogue, but, unfortunately, it happened not to work out in terms of the timetable.
I am sure that those here in this House understand that such things are possible in today's world.
If there are a few failures in trying to get all the main parties around the same table, it just shows that six months is a very short space of time.
As for the debate we had earlier today on the US ATS, as I mentioned and as I understand it, this was referred to in September 2005 in papers which were also sent to the European Parliament, but this was never before such a major issue.
(DE) Important as anti-terrorism may be, one gets the impression - as a shocking example from the United States in particular shows us - that this kind of policy is being used to restrict democratic freedoms, indeed almost to abolish them, and to curtail the freedom of the press.
What has the Finnish Presidency done at European level to prevent things moving in that direction here as well, in view of the fact that we will, in the end, have either a democratic Europe or no Europe?
Mr President, human rights and data protection have always been crucially important in all discussions whenever European policy on counter-terrorism has been formulated and implemented.
In this House I have frequently expressed the Council's position that human rights and the obligations under international agreements must be respected even when counter-terrorism measures are being implemented.
This is also actually the basis for fighting terrorism in the European Union.
We have to remember that European society is very much based on individual freedoms.
We have to take extreme care that when we are defending and protecting this society and its model for living we do not at the same time introduce measures that in fact undermine this society based on freedom of the individual.
As the author is not present, Question No 5 lapses.
Subject: Lithuania's energy prospects
Lithuania is one of the new EU Member States that is most dependent on Russian energy, which is used by Russia as a means of attaining its political objectives.
Only electric energy is produced in Lithuania itself and 80 % of this energy is provided by the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which is scheduled to close in 2009.
Decision No 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks includes plans for the construction of a link between Poland and Lithuania (EÅk-Alytus).
However, the town of EÅk in Poland does not have a developed energy infrastructure or a high-voltage electricity link with western energy networks.
This link does not solve the problem of how to connect Lithuania to the EU energy system.
A new nuclear power plant in Lithuania could not be built before 2014.
The absence of a common EU energy policy and common energy sources (electricity, gas), coupled with a lack of solidarity on the part of EU Member States, threatens to isolate Lithuania from energy suppliers.
Prior to its accession to the European Union, Lithuania signed Protocol No 4 on the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania.
Under this protocol, Lithuania made a commitment to close unit 1 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant before 2005 and unit 2 by 2009.
Without prejudice to this commitment, the general safeguard clause referred to in Article 37 of the Act of Accession is applicable until 31 December 2012 if energy supply is disrupted in Lithuania.
Given such an uncertain state of affairs, could Lithuania apply Article 37 of the Act of Accession and prolong the operation of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, provided that safety standards allow, until Lithuania's energy problems are resolved?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the honourable Member alludes to the application of the general safeguard clause in Article 37 of the Act of Accession.
The Council would like to draw the honourable Member's attention to the answer which was given to her oral question H-0815 this year.
She will certainly have realised that it is for the Commission, if requested with justification by a Member State, to decide on protection measures that it deems necessary in order to respond to a Member State's request.
Let me say here that last week an electric cable connection was established between Estonia and Finland, which will connect electricity networks in the Baltic and the Nordic Countries, and so also improve energy security in Lithuania.
This will also be an important step forward in developing European networks.
- (LT) Madam President, Article 4 of the Accession Treaty establishes a common defence condition until 1 December 2012.
Meanwhile Article 37(1) of the Accession Treaty foresees defence measures in the event of energy difficulties within a three-year period from the date of accession.
It would mean until 1 May 2007 for Lithuania.
Perhaps the Minister could explain the possibility of reconciling these two normative acts and how they could be applied in practice?
I would request a reply in writing.
Mr President, these safeguard clauses may therefore be applied if a Member State makes such a request, if it is thought to be justified, and if the Commission considers that protective measures are necessary in response to it.
I would say again, however, that it is for the Commission to decide on protective measures for a Member State.
- (LT) I would like to ask the Minister about the construction of nuclear power plants.
As we know, each European Union state decides for itself whether it needs to build new nuclear power plants.
Finland does this and does it successfully.
Bearing in mind that nuclear power plants are growing more reliable with every passing year, and that science and technology are reaching ever-newer levels, has the time not come for this question to be reconsidered at the European Union level as well, and for a more positive attitude to atomic energy to be expressed?
Mr President, this question is fundamentally linked to the common European energy debate.
The Finnish Presidency has adopted the view, one that has been approved widely in the Council, that decisions on methods of producing energy are now, and will be in the future, left to the discretion of the Member States.
This is what happens now too.
When we talk about nuclear power, we have Member States where at present more nuclear power stations are being built, Member States that are cutting capacity, and everything in between.
It is nevertheless very important from the point of view of the European energy markets and energy security in Europe that we can create and establish an infrastructure which actually connects the European energy networks, though in this we are still virtually at the starting post.
(DE) What can the Council do to get dangerous nuclear power stations taken off line by court order?
What proposals can you in the Council make in future for the safety of the European public?
Mr President, the Act of Accession is associated with regulations on certain nuclear power units, and at EU level special attention has also been paid to safety in the means of energy production.
It is nevertheless the job of the national authorities to ensure that these safety regulations are also implemented.
This is a crucially important matter, however, which deserves attention.
I should like to ask a question concerning Question 6.
The Rules of Procedure only allows two supplementary questions per question.
On this occasion, however, I shall give you the floor.
President-in-Office, my question is about Lithuanian energy prospects.
Lithuania is planning to build a new nuclear power plant in Ignalina.
It will be a joint project involving Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Those countries will not be able to do this before 2015.
According to our previous agreements we have to close one of our blocks in 2009, and Lithuania will suffer from energy shortages.
Do you, as the representative of the Presidency, think it is possible to prolong the life of Ignalina's second block until 2015?
Mr President, deforestation is one of the most significant factors in the problem of global climate change, accounting for around 20% of the total for man-made greenhouse gas emissions, thus around a fifth of emissions resulting from human activity.
It is the aim of the European Union that, in order to reach the fundamental target in the UN Climate Treaty, the overall average rise in temperature of the earth's surface cannot be more than two degrees centigrade above the temperature during the pre-industrial age.
To achieve this goal a considerable reduction in total volumes will be required, in accordance with common but differentiated areas of responsibility and capabilities.
Because the destruction of tropical forests has major significance for overall emissions, the developing countries have or may have a key role in alleviating climate change, so that emissions caused by deforestation can be cut and sustainable forestry boosted.
Such measures would also help these countries to adapt to climate change and would also have other useful benefits.
The EU therefore stresses the importance of examining the various options with regard to how emissions from deforestation can be cut and, in particular, exploiting synergies with measures taken in other contexts.
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for that answer.
I did not get a 'yes' or 'no' to my question, but a very interesting rÃ©sumÃ© of the problems of climate change - all of which I agree with, but I already know.
My question was whether the Council agreed that avoided deforestation must be included in any post-2012 settlement - in other words, the second commitment period, if we are still talking in Kyoto terms.
Would it be the Council's view that avoided deforestation would be part of our tools and mechanisms for reducing carbon dioxide emissions?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has not yet begun any preparatory work on this.
It will take the necessary decision in good time in compliance with its obligations under the Protocol on the Enlargement of the European Union annexed to the Treaty of Nice.
At this stage, however, it is impossible to say precisely when this will happen.
Let me just say that if the negotiated Treaty on the Constitution comes into force, that will do something to resolve the issue.
Thank you for the answer, which demonstrates that, whether it is under the current Treaties as modified by Nice or under the Constitutional Treaty, the Council has to get to work on a new system for the composition of the Commission, presumably with a rotation.
If that is the case, and if it is going to enter into force in time for the next Commission, would it not be a good idea to begin work sooner rather than later?
Mr President, it is rather hard to say that it would be better to start soon, but we have to remember that these matters are all connected.
It is a question of the entire institutional package, which in turn is connected with the Constitutional Treaty, which includes the composition of the Commission.
I would say again that the Council has not yet begun the preparatory work.
Question No 9 has been withdrawn.
Subject: Status of Kosovo
How does the Finnish Council Presidency explain that, despite the hopes of the highly competent UN Chief Negotiator Ahtisaari, the question of Kosovo's status will not be resolved before the end of the year, and how does it rate the chances of success for next year?
Mr President, since the beginning of the year, UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari has been taking forward talks between the parties using mainly a bottom-up approach.
In July Mr Ahtisaari organised the first high-level meeting between Belgrade and Pristina in Vienna.
The presidents and prime ministers from both sides attended.
At the meeting Belgrade and Pristina expressed totally opposite views on the status of Kosovo.
It is still the strategic goal of the European Union to find a quick and lasting solution to the situation in Kosovo, without endangering Serbian democracy and general stability in the region.
When notification was received that the Serbian parliamentary elections were to be held on 21 January 2007, Martti Ahtisaari said that he would put a proposal to the parties immediately after the elections, as he did not want the solution to Kosovo's status to become an election weapon in Serbia's future elections.
The European Union continues to support Mr Ahtisaari fully, and also his endeavours as leader of the political determination process in respect of Kosovo's future status as well as his recent moves to produce a comprehensive solution.
It is in the Union's interests that the process should have a favourable outcome.
Success is vital, because it would offer favourable prospects for the future, both for the inhabitants of Kosovo and for general stability in the region.
The European Union is now preparing for its future presence in Kosovo as part of an international civil mission.
The EU's preparations for the rule of law and a police operation are also in progress.
(DE) As you know, the population of Kosovo has been through a great deal, so it is naturally anxious about the continuing postponements.
Do you believe this is the last postponement and that the final report really will be presented in February or March?
What have you to say about the fears aroused by the plans for a division of Kosovo or by the territorial claims upon Kosovo contained in the new Serbian constitution?
Mr President, the Council has never discussed this, because it does not fall within its competence.
The European Union treaties have not bestowed on the Community or the Union the competence whereby the Union could regulate on abortions.
The Member States thus have the competence to regulate on this and ensure compliance in their territory with the laws that they pass.
The EU cannot interfere in unsatisfactory states of affairs due to differences in the legislation of Member States when it comes to areas that are not within its competence.
(NL) Mr President, I do indeed understand that this is about who has power over what, but it has to be said that this is a cross-border issue, and so I am surprised that it has not been discussed at all in the Council.
If we talk about European values - something which has also been in the news a great deal - and we also consider the issue of the free movement of people, then we have a European problem, certainly if we take into account the fact that Dutch doctors were involved in this affair.
In short, I should like to ask you again how this relates to the freedom of movement of people, and whether we are not dealing with a European problem of a cross-border nature.
Mr President, I would just like to say that the free mobility of people is one of the European Union's basic concerns.
The movement of services has also been established for a very long time, and if there are illegal goings-on in Member States, it is their responsibility and duty to monitor them and intervene.
In this case it is incontrovertibly clear that big differences between the laws in Member States lead to very different practices around Europe.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Driving licences (debate)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was a hard task.
We started work on it two and a half years ago.
The legislative period was not the most auspicious for getting agreement at first reading, but I believe we have brought the dossier to a good conclusion.
I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues, because we had a very open debate in committee and found that the issue was not so much party political differences as traditions.
My special thanks go to those colleagues who largely backed the project despite the sensitivities in their own countries.
I would also like to thank the Council, because both the Finnish and Austrian Presidencies and not least the Luxembourg Presidency, which created the basis for the compromise, have helped to make it possible for us to reach a good conclusion tomorrow.
(FR) Commissioner, I too should like to thank you because you yourself, as well as your team, have done a very good job of supporting this project.
I am particularly keen to emphasise the expertise that has been shown by the members of your administration in dealing with this very complex matter and that has led us to what I believe are worthwhile solutions.
(DE) I believe the challenges with this directive can be summarised as follows:
Firstly, we thought it was important not to create an additional driving licence, the 111th or 130th, but, over a period of time, to introduce a single European one.
That was to be seen more as a symbol, however, because when driving licences are exchanged we really wanted a record to be made of the licences in circulation and to have documentation so that we know precisely how many driving licences are in circulation in the various countries and who owns them, so that information can be exchanged.
Ultimately it was also about road safety, and there was a particular need for action here in the area of motorcycles.
We achieved that, too.
Moreover, the directive also strikes a good balance between economic viability on the one hand and safety on the other, especially where caravans are concerned.
These common challenges resulted in a common position.
In six years' time, countries will introduce the new driving licence model for new applications.
That will gradually affect 300 million citizens.
But its value for those citizens is more than merely symbolic.
It was this added value that persuaded us all.
We see an improvement in mobility.
A single driving licence that is recognised everywhere will see the end of the problems over the recognition of acquired rights in the various countries, not only for tourists but for professional drivers as well.
That will now be secured once and for all with this proposal.
Legal certainty is one of our most important concerns, and we have created it with this project.
Since this is a compromise, we have to speak about deadlines.
Personally, I would of course have been very glad if everything, both the initial exchange and the regular exchange procedure, had been completed within ten years.
However, some countries insisted that the time allowed for this definitive exchange should be 20 years.
I am rather philosophical here on the principle of better late than never.
I do hope, though, that it will happen rather sooner than the deadline provided in the directive.
In my opinion, safety remains one of the most important aspects.
We have focussed on two important areas here: firstly, the prevention of 'driving licence tourism'.
If countries show good will, the data held in different countries can be used to prevent driving licence tourism when licences are withdrawn, restricted or suspended.
We believe that a person who is a hazard on the road in one country must also be banned from driving in the other 26 countries.
The foundation has been laid; we are waiting for a clear sign from the Member States here.
A second important safety point was in relation to motorcycles.
The principle of progressive access to large motorcycles, which may perhaps in time also be expected in other areas, is based on the accident statistics, which are unfortunately not so good where motorcycles are concerned; it is also a good combination of theory and practice.
Theory first and then practice will make access easy.
In the area of caravans, a good balance was found between economy and safety.
I am pleased that the Commission has accepted our proposal.
We have not only required the additional B+E driving licence for mobile homes and caravans, but also, above a certain weight, a small test.
In conclusion I would say that, thanks to the close cooperation between the three institutions, and also between my fellow-Members of this House, this directive represents added value for the public: greater legal certainty, improved road safety, more mobility, less driving licence tourism and also a plus for the economy and tourism.
Over all, I therefore believe that with this report we have set an example of the pragmatism that is possible in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Mr President, I do apologise.
In fact, a man in my position, having had the honour of participating in parliamentary assemblies for many years, should never be late.
Mr President, honourable Members, please accept my apologies.
Having said that, my embarrassment is still greater, since I must pay tribute to Parliament's excellent work on this very important issue of the directive on driving licences.
I would like to extend my warmest and most sincere thanks to Mr Grosch, whose report is of an extremely high quality, and to the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the support given to the Commission's proposal.
It is clear from the numerous reactions generated by this proposal during the legislative process that this issue is very important to you.
This is to be expected, since the driving licence is the most commonly held qualification in the Union today.
Almost 300 million people depend on their driving licence for their mobility and, of course, in everyday life.
The number of experts in the field, or those who consider themselves as such, is almost as high as the number of holders of driving licences, and each one has their own opinion on the subject.
However, after the political agreement reached in the Council last March and the vote by the Committee on Transport and Tourism at the end of November, a broad consensus is taking shape, confirming that the other institutions approve of the objectives proposed by the Commission.
Although the process has taken a little longer than expected, we are now on the verge of reaching an agreement on second reading with the Council on a very sensitive proposal.
We have perceived the need to apply the new comitology procedure to this proposal for a third directive on driving licences.
This will make the process of amending its technical annexes more transparent.
On this point, an agreement was quickly reached during informal negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
I therefore warmly welcome Parliament's amendments on this particular subject.
I am going to take the liberty, Mr President, of giving a brief reminder of the three objectives that this proposal for a directive on driving licences is designed to achieve, by expounding on Mr Grosch's very pertinent comments.
The first objective is to aid the fight against forgery.
A single model of driving licence, in the form of a plastic card, will in time replace the current system of no fewer than 110 models.
The administrative validity of the licence will be limited to 10 years, with a possible extension to 15 years.
We will reinforce the principle of a single licence per driver and introduce an optional microchip.
These are the measures to combat forgery, as Mr Grosch explained clearly.
The second objective is to improve road safety.
Yes, we will introduce a real driving licence for the most vulnerable users of two-wheeled vehicles, namely drivers of mopeds.
We will put in place an enhanced system of progressive access for driving motorcycles and heavy vehicles, redefine categories B and B+E for driving cars towing heavy trailers and, finally, introduce compulsory initial and ongoing training for examiners.
This point is, in my opinion, particularly important.
The third objective is to facilitate freedom of movement.
We will therefore reaffirm the principle of mutual recognition of driving licences within the European Union.
We will harmonise both the rules on the validity of driving licences and the frequency of medicals for drivers of heavy vehicles.
I would like to conclude by saying that the common position, accompanied by the amendments on the comitology procedure, represents a successful compromise.
I feel that the final text is well balanced and is a real improvement on the current Directive.
Thanks to Mr Grosch's excellent work, we have taken a step towards achieving our common aim of cutting the number of deaths on the roads of the European Union by half before 2010.
Mr President, honourable Members, if I may, I would like to concur with the wish expressed by your rapporteur, Mr Grosch, that the Member States will not wait until the final deadline to introduce this European driving licence, which will be a strong symbol of our European citizenship and of the responsibility assumed by each driver when taking the wheel.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief.
First, I would like to extend my special thanks to Mr Grosch for all he has done.
However, we must first make clear to outsiders what he has achieved, because to the public it looks as though all he has done is to make three applications for the comitology procedure and that otherwise the Council has had its way.
It was, however, Mr Grosch who, in cooperation with his shadow rapporteurs, spent weeks and months negotiating to get a proper, acceptable Council common position together at all.
We must draw express attention to that, or else people will think that all we are doing is approving the common position.
No, we thank Mr Grosch and his colleagues for negotiating for weeks on end to get the Council to present a common position that had been agreed with us.
Two further brief remarks: I am one of the Members who were against mandatory exchange and against limited validity for licences.
We then nevertheless agreed that in the interests of road safety and preventing the forging of licences it is acceptable for citizens to have to exchange their driving licences after 26 years.
Many of us will perhaps not have to do that, if we are wise.
In that regard, 26 years is probably a good compromise and we can readily accept it.
My final remark, Commissioner, is that you were right to say that we hope many Member States will bring all these measures into force earlier.
Please see to it that the Member States act on their promise to put into effect quickly the exchange of data on driving licences, for we will be able to prevent driving licence tourism only if Member States exchange the relevant data and know that they must not issue this or that citizen with a driving licence because he is still banned.
So let us make sure the Member States build the information network quickly.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, at long last, we can begin the move to a common European driving licence.
We have, unfortunately, been forced to accept a latest deadline of 26 years for all the Member States to have introduced the common driving licence.
This is much too long a period.
Like previous speakers, I believe that things will progress more quickly than that.
We must now call on the Member States to take this matter seriously and work towards having a common driving licence sooner, and one, at that, that is replaced at regular intervals.
We must also call on the Commission to assist the Member States in this work, just as Mr Jarzembowski said.
This is an important issue for Europeans, as it affects so many people.
A majority of European citizens possess a driving licence.
There is one thing that we know with certainty, and that is that the people of Europe want it to be easy to drive in their own country and in others and to be able to use their driving licences without administrative hassle.
However, Europeans also want those driving on the roads to be properly qualified so to do.
It should also be possible to punish those who break the law or the rules, even if they come from a different country.
The new common driving licence will, over time, meet all these needs.
Clearly, this has to happen in a timeframe shorter than 26 years.
As has already been pointed out, this measure will improve road safety, but it will also, at the same time, counteract social dumping, so that those aiming to exploit the fact that there are fake driving licences in circulation will not, in future, be able to make financial gains from this.
I would like to close by thanking all the fellow Members I have worked with for the cooperation we have enjoyed.
We have been working on this issue for a long time, and it is no small number of us who have taken an active part in the debate.
Finally, I would like to add that I think it is a positive development that access to motorcycling will be on a progressive basis.
I believe this is a good thing for road safety.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation in the European Commission's Directive concerning the new version of driving licences, replacing the 1991 Directive, solves a range of important issues, namely reducing opportunities for fraud, guaranteeing rights to freedom of movement for citizens, and improving road traffic safety.
I would like to highlight the importance of such a licence for freedom of movement for citizens.
In the EU there are over 100 various forms of driving licences with various validity periods and different intervals for medical testing of professional drivers.
Free movement of individuals also creates opportunities for the abuse of driving licences: having lost permission to drive because of an infringement in his own country, an EU citizen can get a driving licence in another country.
Such behaviour by unscrupulous drivers creates a hazard for traffic safety in all of Europe.
Therefore, it is truly essential to implement the principle of driving licence uniformity.
Speaking of the implementation period for the Regulation, it is projected to be unjustifiably long.
The driving licence's validity may be extended to 15 years, and changed - about 20 years from the Directive coming into force.
Therefore, such periods truly reduce and make more distant the goals defined by the Commission in the recommendation reducing opportunities for fraud and improving road traffic safety.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by extending my sincere thanks to the rapporteur.
I believe that, together with his colleague Mr Jarzembowski, he spent most of his time trying to get a common position.
It was a very difficult task, but he did nevertheless succeed in it, so warm congratulations are due to him.
After a discussion that began more than 10 years ago in the early 1990s, the single EU driving licence in credit-card format will at last become reality and replace the 110 different driving licences.
It will have to be renewed with an up-to-date photograph every 10 or 15 years.
Even though a medical examination will not be required - it has been an accepted fact of life in Italy for years - the EU driving licence will be a contribution to road safety because it will also prevent driving licence tourism.
Anyone who has driven too fast or been caught with alcohol in their blood and lost their licence can at present go abroad and apply for a new licence there.
This practice carries serious risks for road safety.
Traffic offenders often go to Poland or the Czech Republic, thus avoiding not only the months of disqualification but also the medical and psychological examination they urgently require.
With the EU driving licence, that will no longer be possible.
There will be no more opportunity for all-inclusive packages that have enabled people found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs or of speeding to obtain a new licence abroad.
In that way, highway hooligans have for EUR 1 000 avoided not only tiresome waiting times but also expensive medical and psychological examinations.
Given the high rate of accidents caused by speeding and drunkenness, this is an important contribution to road safety.
Random checks have shown that 75% of German car drivers using a foreign driving licence had previously had their licence withdrawn because of alcohol or drug problems.
This abuse will be impossible with the EU driving licence because a thorough exchange of data will prevent it.
I regret to say that my home country, Germany, has had its foot on the brake and, after the 15 years it took to reach a decision, has pushed through a further transitional period of 26 years before drivers will have to exchange their existing licences.
That is not only an act of social injustice at the expense of future generations - the renewal period means that new licence holders will already be on their second driving licence before the old ones have to be exchanged even for the first time - but also a further instance of the state tolerating organised crime by delaying the exchange of data.
In the interests of road safety and especially because of the length of time taken to reach this decision, Parliament and the Council should not have allowed any transitional period, but instead set uniform rules for the validity of old and new driving licences.
Member States are free to shorten the deadlines and I therefore urge you to do so and make the EU driving licence a reality in 10 years.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, two major problems surrounding driving licences have been the cause of public annoyance.
The first is driving licence tourism, as a result of which people can get a driving licence without having any real entitlement to one, and the other is the dangerous situation for riders of two-wheeled vehicles in amidst busy car traffic.
We could solve the second problem nationally, but not the first.
For a very long time, we have been familiar with the situation where people take driving lessons during their holidays, upon which a driving licence is issued in the Middle East or the Caribbean that does not meet the requirements we prescribe at home.
Even more alarming is the situation when somebody who has lost their driving licence following a serious traffic infringement or reckless driving, is given the opportunity to sit another driving test in another Member State of the European Union.
Mutual recognition of national driving licences makes it possible for them, even though they have had theirs withdrawn, to be given the right to drive a car in their own country.
These people misuse national borders and constitute a serious threat to traffic safety.
One of the EU's core tasks is to fight cross-border nuisances and breakdowns in communication, the present situation involving driving licences being one of them.
We must, as a priority, spell out that the Member States of residence should in no way be hindered in combating this dangerous abuse.
The text now before us, which has emerged from second reading, goes about making this possible in the right way.
More controversial is the way in which attention is given to accidents involving motorcyclists and moped riders, which often involve young people, whether as the victims themselves or as the cause of accidents to others.
Some novice riders on two wheels take pride in showing off to others their ability to perform highly dangerous stunts.
We are justified in our attempts to protect people who may cause accidents against themselves and also to protect other road users against the reckless behaviour of a handful.
There is also another side to this: motorcyclists and moped riders are right in believing that car drivers own the roads, which is why the latter would prefer to ban the two-wheelers from them.
Motor cyclists experience it as discrimination if they have to meet more stringent requirements than car drivers, and if they, in practice, also have to be older as a result, before they are entitled by law to use the public roads for the first time.
Not until the age of 24 can they be given the right to ride the heaviest motorcycles without any intermediary steps.
This leads to a clash of interests between the young and old and between drivers of armoured four-wheeled vehicles and vulnerable two-wheeled vehicles.
My group would instinctively prefer to stand up for the riders on two wheels, who are the weakest group, but, in some countries, the aggression manifested by car drivers can lead to a needless increase in the number of victims within this group.
Perhaps this sensitive issue should be addressed in each individual Member State, but in times of increasing cross-border traffic, enforcement would prove impractical.
Three years of discussion about the proposal to harmonise driving licences that were national to date has led to the largest common denominator of requests made by different Member States and pressure groups, which is not to the satisfaction, not by a long shot, of everyone involved, including motorcyclists' organisations.
It is likely that the practical experience we will gather with this directive and the possible problems involved will lead to adjustments being made.
Even so, my group prefers this proposal to be in place for the time being rather than perpetuate the present situation.
The alternative upheld by Mr Bradbourn may work well in the splendid isolation of the United Kingdom, but not for Member States with national borders that cross densely populated areas.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, early this year there was a terrible car crash in my parish. Four young eastern European citizens died.
They had tried to negotiate one of those dreadful Irish country roads in the dark and they were not used to the different driving conditions of Ireland.
Unfortunately, this is not a lone incident.
Similarly, an Irish neighbour died while working in Spain.
Europeans are on the move.
I go to your country, you come to mine.
It is a wonderful thing, yet when it comes to driving in safety it is a fact that some are used to driving on the right and others on the left, that drivers are used to varying acceptable levels of speed, different weather conditions and vastly differing roads and, critically, that drivers are trained, tested and licensed to different levels of competence.
A learner's permit in one country may be equivalent to a full licence in another.
Because we are free to move around Europe, we are driving on each other's roads.
The problem is that when such differences lead to death, these discrepancies can no longer be tolerated.
I agree with several things in the report.
The principle of progressive access regarding two-wheeled vehicles would surely improve safety.
It is also clearly not practical to have 110 different-looking driving licences, which can be displayed but not understood, so the idea of having a single format and code for categories is reasonable.
However, the traffic laws, roads, weather, etc. are so different that a national test and licence will remain essential for a driver.
However, a European driver's licence should be available, like the old international licence, for those who drive in other countries of the Union for more than just a brief holiday.
Finally, although it is not in the report, if we are ultimately to have a European driver's licence, we should look at a different model from the one-test-for-a-lifetime model that we have in Europe.
With such a model, the quality of the test can be very high, which makes it very difficult and very expensive for young people to get, and yet no one looks at the skills of a driver 20 years on.
I would recommend the American model of repeat tests: a written test is taken every four years and a road test every eight years and skills must be kept up.
The level of safety is high in the test, probably the level of technical knowledge, etc. would not be as great, but people continue to drive...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, we really should congratulate ourselves this evening!
If we have a European legal text that really does matter to the man and woman in the street, we hide it in the night sitting.
That way no one can see or hear what we are actually doing for European concerns in European legislation.
A lot might be said about the European added value that could be obtained with the single European driving licence.
We have to thank Mr Grosch for bringing this flea circus together.
He has already mentioned a few things.
We are simplifying, we are making one European driving licence out of 110 national driving licences - and with the new Member States it is already appreciably more than 110.
We are making things safer.
Progressive access has already been mentioned, and many more details might also be mentioned.
We are trying to prevent driving licence tourism, and I can only add my support to those who have called on the Commission to pin the nation states down on this as quickly as possible.
We have also ensured that older drivers will not be discriminated against by permanent medical examinations.
Older drivers may indeed be dangerous in certain driving situations, but the real dangers on the roads are frequently caused by the younger ones.
I am glad - as Mr Grosch has also said - that the Austrian Council Presidency has contributed to today's success.
It fits the picture that that government was then voted out of office by the citizens at home.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with tomorrow's vote the European driving licence will at last be cut and dried.
It has taken a long time, it is a compromise, but with effective and significant steps forward.
The most important advance is perhaps that it will put an end to the unspeakable driving licence tourism.
If, for example, someone's licence is withdrawn for drunken driving in Germany today, they can easily, and quite cheaply, get a new one in a neighbouring country and then drive on Europe's roads again completely legally.
This scandal will be put to an end.
This trick has been played one last time; it will now be laid to rest, and a good job too.
Freedom of movement for drivers in Europe is a plus.
With more than 110 different driving licences, however, controls are more than problematic.
The so-called 'grey rag' in Germany, that was issued in the fifties or sixties with a nice, youthful photograph, and which has been in the washing machine at least four times, is certainly a fine piece of nostalgia, but it is no longer any use as identification at police checks.
Personally - and many other honourable Members obviously agree with me - I think the 26 year deadline that has now been negotiated for exchanging licences is much too long; it is more of a biological solution than a real practical one.
It has been pointed out that Member States can do it earlier.
We shall see.
All the accident statistics clearly show that most road deaths occur among young men between the ages of 18 and 25 on motorcycles.
Progressive access to a motorcycle licence is therefore sensible.
It will save human lives and improve road safety.
On behalf of my Group, sincere thanks are due to Mr Grosch, the rapporteur, who has negotiated well, and so there will be no transitional periods, no exemptions and no restrictions in tomorrow's vote: we shall back you wholeheartedly and unanimously, together taking the matter to a successful conclusion.
Thank you for your work!
Mr President, yesterday the President, faced with a directive about a paperless environment, whispered 'dream on'.
The EU is behind the paper curtain or, in real English, the big EU paper wet blanket.
Over-regulation closes businesses and the EU paper wet blanket is putting out the fire of enterprise and the ember of innovation.
The single market, we were told, was about trade, not about paper regulations on how to ride a moped.
Or are you resisting an invasion of British mopeds on the beach at Dunkirk?
Dream on!
Certain EU states treat EU papers as joke sheets enforced by paper tigers with paper teeth, but they still sit on committees like nodding paper dogs generating more crazy paper regulations for the rest of us and filling in paper forms for expenses, while not enforcing simple rules about crash helmets.
It is now only a matter of time until such a paper dictates that the British will drive on the right hand side!
In this report, the EU has ignored its own research paper, according to the British Motorcyclists Federation, which says that these proposals are inept and ill-conceived.
The BMF has pointed to the motorcycle accidents in-depth study showing that most motorcycle accidents are the result of low-speed urban collisions, usually the fault of the car driver.
It was funded by EU taxpayers at EUR 2.5 million and this directive will now be a EUR 2.5 million waste of paper.
The BMF says that motorcycling elements in the directive are diametrically opposed to the UK Government's own motorcycling strategy, do nothing to improve road safety, and lead to poor compliance with a possible negative effect on safety.
BMF government relations executive Trevor Magnus said this is typical of the lack of democracy in the EU, treating citizens with contempt.
I conclude that the entire proposal should be placed in the waste paper basket and recycled, but not into another wet blanket, please.
(PL) Mr President, I think that it is a very good thing that we are approaching the end of our work on this important report.
Each step along towards improving safety on the roads is really a step that is worth taking and it most definitely includes introducing an international registration procedure for all cases where driving licenses have been revoked or suspended.
The point is clearly to eliminate driving licence tourism.
It is, however, the Member States which bear the primary responsibility here.
They are the ones who should, first of all, improve their system of registering people whose licences have been banned from driving temporarily or permanently.
I hope that this Directive will force the Member States to sort out their own administrative procedures in the first place.
This is, of course, a cause of satisfaction, but it is hard, at this juncture, not to express our regret that the single European driving licence will not come into force for another twenty-five years yet.
Is it not rather paradoxical that incredibly complicated legislation such as REACH, or the Services Directive, will become binding almost immediately, but that an incredibly simple document, such as a driving licence, will only be fully introduced in 2033?
By then things may have developed so far that a driving licence may not be at all necessary, and replaced by other mechanisms, such as electronic mechanisms.
We may even have European citizenship by then, but not a European driving licence.
I understand that some Member States want to stick to tradition but, at least to me, this seems to have nothing to do with tradition.
If anything it is an obsession rather than a tradition.
Mr President, my assistant recently discovered a website which advertises quite openly that if you have been banned for driving in one country they will find, for a fee, a driving licence somewhere else.
That is clearly unacceptable in modern society, just as it is completely unacceptable that people who commit serious offences in one country can avoid being penalised in another country.
This proposal will gradually end that situation, but I regret that it will take so long, and I hope the process can be speeded up.
This proposal brings simplicity and transparency and cuts red tape, although I notice that Mr Nattrass has not bothered to stay to hear that observation.
It is, in fact, a key element in better regulation.
The original proposal was much more bureaucratic, and we in Parliament have done a good job of making it much simpler.
It will improve road safety and combat fraud.
I particularly welcome something nobody else has mentioned yet: the emphasis in the report on the competences of driving examiners.
We need to raise the general level of driver training throughout the European Union.
I am not happy with the motorcycle proposals: they are unnecessarily complex and do not give enough emphasis to training at the very earliest stages and the requirement for compulsory testing.
However, I recognise that there is no real support for this either in Parliament or the Council, so I must concede defeat.
Contrary to some of the scare stories some of my colleagues have spread, there is very little in this proposal that differs from existing UK tradition and practice.
Mr President, firstly I would like to point out to the House that throughout the progress of this legislation I have been in favour of a common format - and I stress 'format' - for a driver's licence across Europe.
This would achieve the objective of easier recognition of licences by police and enforcement agencies in all Member States and lead to less fraud, which has been talked about already.
This can, however, be achieved without all the red tape included in these proposals and in my view it is key to the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality that Member States retain the power to determine how their citizens obtain and retain their licence.
For example, the measures now proposed would completely change the burden of proof, requiring citizens to prove that they can drive safely rather than, as at present, the state having to prove that they cannot.
Regular renewals, even so-called administrative renewals of licences, would just push up costs to licence holders without improving road safety in the slightest way.
I shall cite one example concerning motorcycles.
These measures are ill-thought-out, over-prescriptive and will not lead to any improvements in road safety, simply to making it more difficult for motorcyclists to progress to more powerful bikes.
This is not a road safety measure, it is nothing less than a cynical attempt to make life more difficult for those who use this mode of transport.
Unfortunately, time does not permit me to detail all the matters in this directive to which I object but, put simply, in my opinion there is no added value in these proposals.
They are over-regulatory, over-bureaucratic and unnecessary.
I urge colleagues most sincerely to support my amendments to reject the common position in its entirety.
(PL) Mr President, in contrast to the previous speaker, I would like to stress that the document we are discussing on a single European driving licence is perhaps the first document on European identity.
It is an important document, which will allow me, as a European, to feel safe.
I would like to express my admiration for Mr Grosch.
He has brought together three groups: the pragmatists, the traditionalists and the ultra-traditionalists.
This has been the reason for the delay.
I would personally tend more towards introducing the new licences within a shorter timeframe, but this is a compromise solution.
Let us respect it.
One important fact I would like to point out is that the way in which licences are obtained, the training methods and the examination methods have become more harmonised.
This is also likely to lead to the elimination of differences in behaviour on the road.
There will be more travel between the Member States.
This is a very important aspect of improving road safety.
Another factor is the creation of a database.
I see nothing wrong with obtaining a driving licence abroad.
What is wrong is when people get them after breaking the law and losing their licence their own country.
Overall, I am very happy to vote in favour of this proposal.
(PT) We are confident that tomorrow's vote will confirm the timeframe involved in the legislative process of adopting a European drivers' licence.
I should first like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his outstanding report.
He was in charge of this long process, which was characterised by positive dialogue and effective action leading to a compromise that, reflecting the perspectives of the various Member States and Community institutions, succeeded in maintaining consistency on an issue that, as he has correctly pointed out, affects around two thirds of the adult population of Europe.
My main concern was that a good idea might be undermined by excessive regulation, and would thus fail to benefit road safety.
The consensus achieved, however, built on the key axes of the directive, enables us to look ahead with optimism.
The text appears on the whole to have achieved the objectives it set out to achieve, whilst complying with the subsidiarity principle and with practices that are legitimately established by the Member States.
This is a positive development that will provide the citizens with clearer, standardised rules conducive to mobility and road safety.
The rules will also prevent the fraudulent use of counterfeit licences and will lead to more effective measures to deal with offenders.
The new directive will reach those it is intended for by means of what I hope will be a simple, easily understood message, with which hopefully the citizens will comply without much difficulty.
It should be clear that our objective is to facilitate the citizens' lives and the lives of those operating in the sector, and to promote safer road transport.
To conclude, I wish to comment on the controversial issue of phased, gradual access to motorcycles, and the imposition of a minimum age of 24 for the most powerful motorcycles, in the absence of previous experience.
Speaking as a biker - yes, I am an old biker! - I recognise that age is not the only indicator of maturity and a responsible attitude on the road, but along with experience it is the best indicator that the law has at its disposal.
The point is that there are motorbikes on the market that can reach speeds close to those of Formula One.
Such vehicles should not be within reach of young people barely 18 years of age.
I for one would never let a child of mine of that age have access to one.
I therefore endorse the solution reached aimed at the most vulnerable motorcyclists, who are the youngest members of our society.
(ES) Mr President, I believe that we must thank the rapporteur, Mr Grosch, in particular for this Christmas present from the European Union to 300 million European citizens.
It is true that he has been accompanied in this role of an early Santa Claus by Commissioner Barrot and his services, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, with whom he has done an excellent job.
Thank you, Mr Grosch.
Thank you for adding to the road safety aspects such important elements as the fight against fraud and licence tourism by improving control by means of an on-line database.
For a country of tourism such as mine, that was essential and urgent, and now more than ever since, with the application of the points system on licences, an utterly condemnable form of tourism is being created involving new licenses from over the border or via the Internet, as Mr Titley has just said.
With regard to motorcycles, a wisely educational procedure of gradual access has been introduced which will help our young people to grow up, although some of them believe that they can go quicker.
The provisions relating to trailers and motor caravans improve control without increasing burdens.
I am also grateful for the fact that this instrument adds greater visibility and enhances the free movement of persons.
This instrument is also going to be very useful for professional drivers.
It is true that the timescales seem eternal, but I share the rapporteur's optimism that, in practice, the change will take place more quickly.
The citizens are almost always ahead of their legislators.
Finally, and although the rapporteur advises us that the periodic and obligatory renewal of licences does not involve obligatory refresher, medical or sight tests for drivers, I believe that we have here an excellent basis for progressing towards a future practical consensus on this new aspect.
I am optimistic about this as well and I would therefore encourage Mr Grosch to work towards making a success of that new element.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Grosch on a good result.
In the negotiations with the Council, he succeeded in getting many points of Parliament's position included in the final compromise.
Thus, in addition to the euro - our European currency - we will get a European driving licence.
This will finally end driving licence tourism: if your licence is taken away in one country, you will be unable to get a new one in another country.
It is also very good that fraud will be reduced, as we have succeeded in getting a limited period of validity from the Member States.
It is a pity for Mr Jarzembowski and other German colleagues, but it is good for road safety in Europe.
A compromise always means you win some and you lose some.
It would have been fairer on the motorcyclists if they could get access to heavy motorcycles at the age of 21 instead of 24.
You can drive a big SUV or a Ferrari when you are only 18 years old but, under this proposal, you have to wait another six years to get direct access to heavy motorcycles.
That is disproportionate.
If the Commissioner really wants to do something about the safety of motorcyclists, he should improve research in that area and take measures based on that research.
It will become clear that, in addition to good driving education, we need to improve our infrastructure - with better crash-barriers, for example - in order to improve safety for motorcyclists.
Finally, I am pleased about the introduction of extra possibilities for drivers with a category 'B' licence to tow heavy trailers.
Therefore, I strongly support this new directive for a European driving licence.
Mr President, I primarily want to thank Mr Grosch and all the other Members of this House who have worked on this important piece of European legislation.
I would support almost anything that will improve the safety of our roads.
I come from a Member State - Ireland - which has one of the worst fatality rates of all, which is causing considerable concern to all our citizens.
It is partly to do with the fact that we do not have adequate training of drivers, partly also that we have so many drivers on the road who are unqualified.
Of the 2.5 million drivers on Irish roads, 410 000 do not have a driving qualification - they are on what are known as provisional licences.
Some 30 000 of them are on their fifth provisional licence.
Clearly they are a danger to other road users, so I appeal to those who have reservations about this piece of legislation to support it and support the preservation of life on our roads.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to welcome the achievement of the policy and interinstitutional agreement on an issue which is so important to road safety and legal security in Europe, to freedom of movement, to transparency and to the functioning of the single market.
I consider our unifying procedure to be an important success.
The some 110 models of driving licences crystallise the various traditions and various practices in the public administration of our countries and for us to manage to combine effective European harmonisation with respect for subsidiarity is a challenge and constant endeavour.
Thus, I believe that the result on the basis of which we shall have a single type of driving licence in the form of a credit card and the provision for older driving licences to be replaced over a satisfactory period of time are very important, so that the public agencies can make financial and bureaucratic adjustments.
This endeavour is also complemented and derives added value from the need for uniform models for training and for controlling instructors and will of course acquire even greater added value if it is complemented by suitable infrastructures, with road signs and every sort of infrastructure which facilitates safety, including the quality of roads.
We believe that the European driving licence brings Europe very close to the citizens and is a wager we must not lose.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has long been taken for granted that forms of personal identification such as passports and identity cards have to be renewed at particular intervals of time.
That is not the case with driving licences.
Even if a person's name has changed several times and the photograph is over 40 years old, many are still driving with their original licence.
Is that not an invitation to lawbreaking and driving licence tourism?
Is it not frequently a cause for unpleasantness during road checks?
Even the registration numbers of vehicles licensed in the EU have a recognition value.
They make a contribution, albeit very small, to the development of a European sense of identity.
The 110 valid models of driving licence, on the other hand, show Europe as a patchwork quilt.
Is that what the directive's critics want?
It really is time for a standard European driving licence in credit-card format.
The Council common position to all intents and purposes reflects the will of Parliament and promises great steps forward in road safety.
We should vote for it tomorrow so it can be introduced as quickly as possible!
I still cannot understand, however, why we are allowing the Member States such long transitional periods.
I call on my own country, Germany, to set a good example and respond more quickly of its own free will.
If every country does that, the driving licence directive's positive developments could come into effect within the period of the third EU road safety action programme, that is to say, by 2010.
Sadly, the Council's decisions are not always consistent with the Lisbon Strategy.
Potential for growth and employment will be unnecessarily lost, for example, if workshop personnel are allowed to drive 40-tonne trucks for repair purposes, but not empty buses any more.
And I do not understand the logic if a B licence is under certain circumstances to be enough to drive car and caravan combinations up to 4.25 tonnes, but not to drive a mobile home that is easier to manoeuvre.
What a pity!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for this rewarding debate, which has confirmed the very broad support from which the compromise negotiated between our three institutions now benefits.
I should very much like to congratulate you all, and in particular Mr Grosch, your rapporteur, for this excellent outcome.
In response to the handful of negative remarks that have been made, I should like, honourable Members, to point out that we have a moral commitment to a major objective: that of halving the number of people killed on our roads between now and 2010.
It is therefore up to each one of you to consider what share of responsibility you have in this connection.
Together with the Member States, we have adopted an across-the-board approach based in the first place on vehicle quality.
In conjunction with my colleague, Mr Verheugen, we have drawn up a road map whereby motor manufacturers might progressively introduce all the systems that help make vehicles safer.
The second key element in our approach is the Commission's adoption, on 5 October 2006, of a proposal for a Directive on road infrastructure safety management.
Indeed, we want to see better account taken of safety, from design right through to infrastructure building, and this for the benefit of all road users, including motorcyclists.
The third key element is, of course, the personal behaviour of each driver - something to which the document that you will have before you for approval tomorrow makes a major contribution, in my opinion.
In this connection, I should like once again, Mr President, to emphasise the extent to which Parliament has genuinely championed the European interest where this matter is concerned.
By putting forward significant plans and having them accepted - for example, the progressive replacement of old driving licences and the implementation of conditions under which access is granted on a progressive basis to certain categories of vehicle - the European Parliament has vividly demonstrated something that really goes without saying: its concern to champion the interests of Europeans.
A few worries have emerged regarding motorcyclists, motorcycle safety being an issue of great concern to us.
Despite the improvement in road safety in general, motorcyclists are the group most in danger on our roads, with one person in every five killed on European Union roads being a motorcyclist.
It is in order to reverse this trend that, in this directive, we have emphasised access to the most powerful motorcycles on a progressive basis.
More experience, targeted training or an appropriate examination would enable us to reduce the number of fatalities.
This is not a matter of red tape.
On the contrary, matters are being simplified. It is only logical, however, for motorcyclists to be given some degree of training.
It is essential that motorcyclists be trained.
Annex 6 to the directive in question is devoted to such training, and it will be possible for this annex to be modified as needs change.
Mr President, honourable Members, the agreement that will be voted on tomorrow constitutes an important stage in our action plan on road safety.
In view of the very nearly 40 000 people still killed each year on European Union roads, Parliament may be considered to be doing some very worthwhile work in undoubtedly saving a number of lives by means of these new provisions.
I would therefore offer my sincere thanks to Parliament and the rapporteur for the sterling work they have done.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers (debate)
The next item is the report by Fernand Le Rachinel, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 on the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94 C6-0104/2006.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to present to you today the amendment to the regulation on double-hull oil tankers.
This proposal is designed to bring the regulation into line with the political statement made at the International Maritime Organisation in December 2003 by the Presidency of the European Union on behalf of the Member States and of the European Commission.
This statement was extremely clear.
It was designed to indicate to all the parties signatory to the MARPOL Convention that no EU Member State would authorise oil tankers flying its flag to make use of one of the exemptions laid down by the Convention, namely that relating to the use of single-hull vessels to carry oil.
With regard to the ban on carrying heavy grades of oil in single-hull vessels, the current regulation only applies to vessels entering waters under Community jurisdiction.
This means that a Member State may in theory, and contrary to the public commitment of 2003, authorise the carriage of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers flying its flag - that is to say, one of the European flags - as long as these vessels are operating outside Community waters.
This situation, honourable Members, is unacceptable.
It is easy to imagine the consequences, in a third country, of an oil slick caused by an oil tanker flying a Community flag, and this at a time when Europe, for its part, protects itself against such eventualities.
I would add that almost all the Member States have already formally informed the International Maritime Organisation that they would not make use of this option.
Our political commitments to our partners in the interests of maritime safety need to be given practical form and guaranteed legally.
That is the purpose of this proposal.
I should like to thank Mr Le Rachinel and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for having supported it.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to thank, in particular, the secretariat of the Committee on Transport and Tourism for its excellent preparative work and its work in consulting the interested parties in the context of this important matter.
What we are mainly concerned with here is the protection of the environment against marine pollution.
The report that I am submitting to you today is about the accelerated introduction of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers.
In particular, it is a question of putting an end to the exemptions that have existed since 2002.
Indeed, after the 'Prestige' oil tanker went down in 2002, the Commission had decided, in accordance with the December 2002 regulation, to speed up the withdrawal of single-hull oil tankers.
It was also a question of banning, with immediate effect, the carriage of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers bound for or leaving ports in a Member State of the European Union.
At present, international maritime legislation specifies that a vessel flying the flag of a Member State may take advantage of the exemptions from this ban, insofar as - and this goes without saying - it is operating outside European ports.
As Mr Barrot has just mentioned, it was at a meeting of the International Maritime Organisation that the Italian Presidency of the EU stated, on behalf of the 15 Member States, that the latter would not authorise their tankers to make use of this exemption from Regulation 13H. According to the Commission, it was therefore appropriate to amend the 2002 regulation by doing away with the last exemption to Regulation 13H and, therefore, to ban the carriage of heavy grades of oil in single-hull oil tankers flying the flag of a Member State, whatever the jurisdiction applicable to the ports, offshore terminals or maritime area in which these tankers operate.
Only one European country - Greece - had refused to accept this political position adopted by the Italian Presidency, believing that this statement was not binding on it.
It wished, it seems, to continue to authorise its single-hull tankers to operate outside European ports with, of course, heavy grades of oil on board.
Finally, this objection was not renewed during the work done by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
The 25 Member States of the European Union have now agreed that not a single oil tanker carrying heavy grades of oil will any longer be authorised to fly the flag of a Member State if it is a single-hull vessel.
In reality, this only confirms what is already complied with and applied by the vast majority of Member States.
The absolute demand for compliance with the objective of maximum maritime safety has again prevailed in this matter, in the same way as the demand for a reduction in the risks of pollution by hydrocarbons.
There are many pollution risks, which may vary in nature.
Barely five days ago, in my region, toxic barrels were drifting between the Cotentin and the Atlantic.
In the course of last Friday evening, these barrels had been lifted by a storm from the deck of a Swiss container on its way from Antwerp to Portugal.
Admittedly, the new double-hull legislation constitutes a notable advance in the field of preventing marine pollution, but there is a need to continue issuing standards enabling tankers and merchant ships to offer the maximum number of safeguards.
The motorways of the sea are a way of relieving congestion, but vessel safety must not be neglected under any circumstances.
What is at stake here is the future of the whole planet.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to emphasise that I am tabling a technical amendment, which also has the support of the European Commission, that prevents our having to change a series of cross-references.
Being of a linguistic nature, this amendment only concerns the English version.
It does not alter the substance of the text, and the Finnish Presidency has confirmed to us that it does not present any problem to the Council.
Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats thanks the rapporteur for producing his report promptly, quickly, clearly and precisely, and we are able to support it.
I also hope that the Council will, as promised, accept our amendment, so that we can bring this dossier to a conclusion at first reading.
Mr Vice-President, you are absolutely right.
We must abolish the exemption that still exists regarding the non-use of double-hull tankers.
I find the last sentence, which we are taking over from the rapporteur as an amendment, quite classic; it says quite plainly that oil tankers carrying heavy grades of oil, irrespective of their flags - not only Member State flags - will not be allowed to enter ports or offshore terminals or to anchor in areas under the jurisdiction of a Member State unless they are double-hull tankers.
That is important; we have already had some very difficult situations in the Baltic, and I hope that what we said in 2003 - namely that heavy-grade oils may only be carried in double-hull tankers - will now at last be enforced.
If we are indeed concluding the Commission proposal with the amendment quickly at first reading, then we should remind the Council that next year we have to deal with seven separate proposals in the Erika 3 package.
I hope the Council will work with us on them just as quickly so as to improve flag state controls, port state control and liability.
I am eager to see whether the Council will pluck up the same courage as the Commission and Parliament next year to take active measures to prevent environmental pollution at sea.
Mr President, if we want to know about the consequences and repercussions of bad and old single-hull tankers, we must go to the Breton or Galician coast and talk to the people who live there.
The names Erika and Prestige bring back terrible memories for them.
The Commission's Erika packages were a sensible response to those disasters.
They include Regulation 417/2002 with the more rapid introduction of double-hull tankers and the ban on carrying heavy-grade oil to and from European ports in single-hull tankers.
The Commission's proposal that tankers carrying heavy-grade oil under European flags must now be double-hull tankers is consistent and brings a little more safety for shipping and the sea.
You see, Commissioner, Parliament is able to accept and commend proposals from yourself without more ado.
Now, as Christmas approaches, the Commission should again be complimented for such good proposals, to which no one can object!
Parliament need not be perturbed if the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, Intertanko, is not exactly pleased at the Commission's proposal.
Mr Le Rachinel, the rapporteur, was well advised to give priority to maritime safety and not to Intertanko, and at this point I want to say a sincere thank you to him on behalf of my Group.
I therefore expect that we shall have a good vote in Parliament tomorrow over all, thereby making our seas a little safer.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after several catastrophes involving single-hull tanker ships on the shores of France and Spain, experts have come to the conclusion that single hulls do not sufficiently protect ships, that inappropriate methods for testing ships are used, and furthermore, that it is essential to more effectively tackle the issue of 'flags of convenience' - flags of those countries that do not conform to EU safety requirements.
In 2002, the EU adopted a Regulation specifying a double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull tanker ships, and specifying that single-hull tankers should be gradually phased out of EU waters.
Not later than by 2015 they should be replaced by much safer double-hull ships.
The Regulation stipulates that one year after the completion date of constructing the ship, single-hull oil tankers are forbidden to sail under the flag of an EU Member State.
The Regulation also stipulates that after this date no oil tanker, regardless of what country's flag it sails under, will be allowed to sail into any port under the jurisdiction of any EU country, except for double-hull oil tankers.
In October 2003, a Regulation came into force partially replacing the 2002 Regulation, forbidding the transportation of petroleum in single-hull tanker ships into and out of ports under the jurisdiction of EU Member States.
More changes are being recommended in the proposed 2006 EP and Council Regulation.
It is recommended to increase the requirements on the transportation of crude petroleum products by ships sailing under the flag of an EU Member State and the areas of application, prohibiting the transport of crude petroleum products by all single-hull ships sailing under the flag of an EU Member State, regardless of the jurisdiction of the ports, the sea terminals or sea zone in which they ply their trade.
It is recommended to impose a total ban at the EU level, and to let third countries decide for themselves whether or not to accept entry of single-hull tankers into their ports.
I would like to highlight the issue of 'flags of convenience', in other words, the possibility of registering ships in countries where it is cheap and where no technical safety and environmental standards are enforced.
In the event of an oil spill it is very hard to determine who the vessel's proprietor is, and who the polluter is.
An example of this could be the toxic pollution in CÃŽte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).
I believe the issue of such registration should be discussed separately in Parliament.
Another important matter - the qualifications of ship employees.
On ships registered in EU countries, one-third of the crew are citizens of third countries, and, according to expert opinion, most accidents on board happen because of the crew's lack of qualifications.
My country, Lithuania, imports petroleum using a terminal in the Baltic Sea; therefore, we are concerned about both the safety of ships and the environment.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, 10 years ago, the idea of tough measures to put an end to single-hulled oil tankers was not yet a realistic one.
The problems were underestimated and it was the costs involved in changing them that received most attention.
We first needed the disasters involving oil tankers and the extensive destruction of marine and coastal environment before the realisation kicked in that Europe should not lead the way rather than lag behind.
Single-hulled tankers for the transport of heavy oil types are dangerous and should be phased out as soon as possible.
Not until an American ban and the threat that all old tankers from America would head for Europe did we see a majority in favour of such a phase-out policy.
Unfortunately, the 2002 Regulation does not appear to be sufficiently clear.
Single-hulled tankers under European flag, in particular 20 old Greek tankers, can still cause disasters in other parts of the world.
We need to close this loophole as a matter of urgency.
Europe may not want single-hulled tankers from others in its ports, but we should not send single-hulled tankers to ports of other countries either.
The freedom for existing single-hulled tankers to continue to transport heavy types of oil until 2015 could well cause major problems.
