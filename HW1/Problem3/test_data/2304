The added advantage is that more coherence and greater clarity in the policy allow for outgoings to be monitored more efficiently.
Finally, the Member States will also be able to submit a reliable estimate prior to the drafting of the budget.
After all, the reservoir of payment appropriations is mainly the result of excessive levels of commitment appropriations.
If we no longer want this reservoir, we will need to tackle the problem at source.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nobody these days would dare to question the fact that the Structural Funds have been and still are an essential tool for reducing inequalities in regional development.
It pains me greatly, therefore, to see that as much as EURÂ 91.6Â billion in available funds â or the equivalent of the European Unionâs annual budget â has not yet been used.
In the run-up to the deadline for the 1994-99 programming period, there were still some 300Â European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) programmes which had made no claims for payment whatsoever.
Under the circumstances, such figures verge on the disgraceful.
My sole consolation is the knowledge that, of all the Member States, Portugal is one of the best at implementing the Funds.
In fact, for Community support framework II (QSF II), for which complete data have only recently become available, Portugalâs implementation rates are exemplary: 99.6% for the ERDF, 98.3% for the European Social Fund (ESF), 100% for the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund(EAGGF) and 90% for the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG).
Portugalâs overall execution rate of 94.2% is significantly higher than those of its European partners.
Similarly, the QSF-III for 2000-2006 is still proving very irksome for the European Union.
Yet again, the figures for Portugal are on track, according to the mid-term reviews.
The causes of this under-implementation are well-known: long, complex programmes, unreliable payment forecasts and overlapping programming periods.
In the face of the large amounts of unused funds, the Council has proposed solutions which, to my mind, err on the side of caution.
I am convinced that measures such as these will not yield the results expected of them, and that some of them will even be counterproductive.
The Commission should be forced to take responsibility for defining priorities, enhancing the consistency of operations and monitoring implementation, leaving the Member States solely responsible for implementing and managing structural operations.
Apart from anything else, this under-execution of the Structural Funds is extremely bad for the image of the European Union among its citizens.
Finally, as a citizen of Portugal and a native of the Algarve, I am hopeful that the forthcoming QSF-IV for 2007-2013 will continue to allow the Algarve region to benefit from structural operations, even in the context of an enlarged Europe.
If that does not happen, I feel it would be legitimate to call for a fair solution permitting regions such as this, which are ineligible simply due to the effects of the statistical impoverishment of the enlarged European Union, to be assisted in their quest for convergence.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I too regret the fact that Structural Funds appropriations have been underused to the tune of EURÂ 22Â billion.
My concern deepens given that, as we know, outstanding payments for the years 2000-2006 have now risen to more than EURÂ 76Â billion, thus running the risk of decommitment under the n+2 rule.
This is deplorable in view of the high levels of unemployment and poverty pertaining in some Member States, such as Portugal, and the lack of social services and infrastructure, which are essential for social inclusion.
Economic and social cohesion is a central aim of the European Union.
For this very reason, the Structural Funds are vital to promoting genuine convergence; they also contribute to redistribution within the Community budget.
Failure to execute those funds, therefore, does not merely jeopardise the aim of economic and social cohesion. It also serves to accentuate existing regional inequalities.
The causes of this situation, then, must be dealt with, both by resolving bureaucratic problems through simplifying and decentralising measures, and, above all, by eliminating the budgetary constraints imposed by the Stability Pact.
That pact must be reviewed, not forgetting that the Structural Funds are even more important in the run-up to the enlargement of the European Union.
The policy of economic and social cohesion, then, demands that these procedures be reviewed so that we can effectively benefit from all the funds available.
Â Â  . â Please excuse me for taking advantage of your attention, but I think that this debate is important and that many of the comments not only deserve our attention, but also comments and answers from us.
Mr Pohjamo and MrÂ vanÂ Dam pointed out, as did MrÂ Pittella, that it was important that this new n+2 rule was properly used for the 2000-2006 programme: we noticed at the end of 2002 that it had not caused very significant decommitments.
The moment of truth will be at the end of 2003, as many of the regionalised programmes were signed in 2001.
Personally, I think that the rules are useful.
It is a rule of good management.
Like Mr Pohjamo, I also think that the key lies largely in the Member States improving their forecasts.
You have stressed this point.
MrsÂ Glase mentioned over-complicated procedures.
I would like to put forward my point of view, and I must say again, as I would say to Mr Markov, that I have to implement these procedures because they are in the regulations, which you are well aware of, which were established at BerlinÂ 2000-2006.
I have sought to use all the margins for flexibility in these regulations and I have found some, which you were informed of last year when I met with the Ministers to propose them: we are already seeing some effects of these simplification and flexibility measures.
Nevertheless, I cannot act as if these Berlin rules did not exist.
I admit that they are complicated.
I think that we can simplify them.
One way of avoiding having to make such observations during the next period â Mrs Glase mentioned planning for too long a period â is to reduce the time of that planning: I agree with this idea.
When I became a Commissioner at the end of 1999, I had to implement this new period.
What have I been doing for one or two years, practically two years?
I have been consulting and planning with the regions and Member States.
For the first two years of the programme, we did not use any money, we did not undertake any projects, because the first two years, 2000 and 2001, were used for negotiating the programmes.
The reason why I have moved the debate forward for the future period and why at the end of 2003 the Commission is proposing its guidelines and new policies for cohesion and its plans for regulation for 2004, is in order to move the whole process forward, and, as long as the governments, the Council and Parliament give their views on the future Agenda, the Financial Perspectives and these policies as soon as possible, we will then be able to use the last year of this 2000-2006 period, 2006, for consultation rather than waiting for the start of the next period.
The hope that I have â I am again being very cautious â what I am working for, Mr Pittella, ladies and gentlemen, is for us to have clear ideas as to the amount of money available, on the new cohesion policies and the new regulations quite soon in order to be able to devote the whole of 2006 to consultation regarding future programmes and for us to thus be able to undertake programmes and projects from the start of the future period and not two years after the start.
That is my aim.
MrÂ dosÂ Santos and MrÂ Markov mentioned the outstanding commitments.
Personally, I say to MrÂ dosÂ Santos, I have not tried to deny MrÂ Pittellaâs figures: I know these figures well, and I have tried to explain them impartially, because there are explanations.
At the same time, along with my colleagues I have endeavoured to gradually reduce this RAL: for example, for the ERDF, the outstanding commitments for the 1994-1999 period were EURÂ 7 billion at the end of 2002; they will probably be EURÂ 3.8 billion at the end ofÂ 2003.
We have therefore reduced them practically by half.
Mr Markov, I was surprised by one of your comments regarding making the n+2 rule more flexible: you talked about the possibility of n+3.
If we go down this road, we risk worsening the utilisation problems and worsening the outstanding commitments.
Yes, Mr vanÂ Dam, I am working on simplification for the next period: I want to reduce the number of instruments, I want to reduce the number of planning decisions.
I will undoubtedly propose abolishing the zoning of Objective 2.
I want to focus the priorities and also base matters on the projects and increase the flexibility and redeployment margins during the period.
These are the simplification ideas that we are working on.
Mr vanÂ Dam, I do not, however, share your feelings regarding the results of this Structural Funds policy.
I do not think that it is possible to create a map of bad management as rapidly as you did: I know of cases of bad management in countries that have been members of the European Union for a long time and not only in the new countries in the South.
I do not think that we can point the finger at any particular country, as in those countries I am seeing an overall effort, even if it is sometimes quite slow, to improve management and control and to modernise administration.
You asked for the next policy to concentrate on Objective 1, on the regions that are poorest or most behind in their development: that is what we will propose but, nevertheless, I have not decided on removing all European action from the other regions.
In the current Member States of the Union, sometimes even in the developed regions, there are real problems linked to industrial relocation, restructuring, poverty, extreme poverty in cities, and the problems of desertification in certain areas of the countryside.
I do not think that Europe can be indifferent, that the Union can be indifferent to these problems in the fifteen countries of the current Union, because if the Union is indifferent, if it has to concentrate all of its budget on the new countries plus a few regions in the South, we should not be surprised if the people themselves become indifferent to the European Union.
The whole policy that I am aiming at with this reform of the Structural Funds for the future period is focusing and using this policy to serve the broad objectives of solidarity and of the Lisbon and Gotenborg Agenda, making the regions, rather than spectators, the partners in these objectives.
In any case, Mr vanÂ Dam, I can tell you very clearly that personally, I am in favour of a real reform, sometimes even a radical reform: I will never be in favour of the re-nationalisation of this cohesion policy.
MrÂ Piscarreta mentioned the idea of going further, as did MrÂ Pittella himself, in entrusting the Member States with management: yes, I am ready to go very far in decentralising management, but naturally, that means that first there must be a better sharing of financial responsibility.
As long as the European Commission is practically solely responsible to the budgetary authority, and the Court of Auditors, I am obliged to check, control and ensure that the control systems are correct and are operational.
Probably, in the spirit of what is written in the new European Constitution, we will be able to move towards a better sharing of responsibility and therefore towards a greater decentralisation.
This is what I wanted to say very quickly in response, and to say to Mr Pittella and each of you that I remain prepared to answer all of your questions before your committees and the plenary and to continue this dialogue: we need it, and many of the suggestions made in Mr Pittellaâs report will be among the proposals that the Commission will make, particularly in terms of managing the future cohesion period, in the third cohesion report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0345/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position of the Council with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs (9714/1/2003 â C5-0299/2003 â 2002/0152(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Ferreira).
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must thank my colleagues and the Secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the officers responsible in the Directorate General in charge of this matter, for their very good cooperation.
It was following essential work in partnership with the different political groups and the representatives of the Commission and the Council that we arrived at this text, which will be put to the vote tomorrow.
This is a report that we can be satisfied with, as it places consumer protection at the heart of our concerns.
By considerably reducing levels of cyclamate in drinks following an evaluation by the Scientific Committee we are responding well to the demands of European citizens in terms of consumer protection.
The Commission undertaking to re-evaluate all sweeteners in the near future is also a decision that is in line with our objectives, as we are aware that we need consistent statistics and that we need to regularly re-examine our positions in the light of the new data.
I understand my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who wish to place particular emphasis on aspartame.
However, in this respect we need to take into account the recent evaluations that have taken place both in France and the United Kingdom, and consider that perhaps there is no reason for singling out aspartame, as we know, of course, that it is going to be evaluated on a more global level anyway.
Now we need to realise that we also have our weaknesses, and the fact that we were not able to reach an agreement on the subject of defining fine bakersâ wares shows that our work is not quite finished and that labelling will have to be the subject of future legislation.
This element of the report also demonstrates the position that we intend to give sweeteners in food.
They are essential for treating certain diseases and on this subject, I have received many letters from people suffering from diabetes and other illnesses, saying how pleased they were to be able to vary their diet thanks to an increasing number of products containing sweeteners.
There is also a risk that they will be increasingly consumed by Europeans if we consider the many alarming reports of a constantly increasingly number of people suffering from obesity.
However, this serious public health problem should not be solved by sweeteners but by preventing the disease.
Moreover, some studies have shown that the power of sweeteners led to nutritional behaviour involving an increase in the consumption of sugar or sweet products.
We are all aware here that the multitude of increasingly sweet and increasingly varied products aimed at children is not an insignificant factor in this public health problem.
In saying this, I am not moving away from the subject that we are dealing with this evening, because sweet products, whether or not they contain sweeteners, are interdependent.
I know that the Commissioner is particularly aware of this public health problem.
He can be assured that it is a priority for us.
In conclusion, I will say that we can consider sweeteners as useful, which is why, through this legislation, we are authorising two new products to be placed on the market.
However, we now need to ensure that they are only essential to an increasingly restricted number of European citizens.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament for its collaboration on this proposal.
In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, for her work on this dossier.
There are four proposed amendments to the common position.
The first amendment would delete comitology for deciding whether a substance should be considered as a sweetener.
The Commission made this proposal as such a decision is of technical nature and can already be taken by comitology for all other food additives, in accordance with existing legislation.
The Commission would have welcomed a formal tool to bring certain substances under the scope of the food additive legislation. This is in the interest of consumer protection.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has refused this, but your rapporteur pointed out that the Commission proposal should be re-considered when the framework legislation on food additives is considered for amendment.
Furthermore, the committee has agreed to grant comitology to decide whether a sweetener is used according to Good Manufacturing Practice, as proposed by the Council.
In the spirit of compromise, the Commission can accept this amendment and will, as suggested by your rapporteur, retable its request in the context of the amendment of the framework legislation on food additives.
The second amendment requires the Commission to present a progress report on the re-evaluation of additives in general and, in particular, on the two newly authorised sweeteners.
A similar amendment has already been accepted in the context of the amendment of another directive on food additives.
Therefore, for the sake of consistency, the Commission can accept this amendment.
The third amendment concerns the transposition of the directive.
It introduces a clause for the exhaustion of stocks of products no longer conforming to the directive.
For this, a time limit of 24 months after entry into force of the directive, is set.
The Commission can accept such a clause and welcomes the fact that it is limited in time.
This limitation in time creates legal certainty and facilitates the enforcement of such a clause.
The fourth and final amendment calls for the re-evaluation of the authorisation of two sweeteners â aspartame and stevioside.
The Commission cannot accept this amendment for the following reasons.
At the request of the Commission, aspartame has been re-evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food in collaboration with the British and French Food Safety Authorities.
To this end, the scientists have reviewed all the scientific literature published since the last opinion on aspartame, amounting to some 150 articles.
The resulting opinion, adopted as recently as December of last year, fully reconfirmed the safety of aspartame and that the intake of this sweetener remains well below the acceptable daily intake.
As regards labelling, the presence of aspartame in a foodstuff must be labelled, as for any other additive.
Furthermore, the labelling of a foodstuff containing aspartame must bear a particular warning to protect consumers that do not tolerate this sweetener due to a specific metabolic disorder.
The Commission, therefore, does not consider it justifiable to proceed with a further re-evaluation of this sweetener or to alter its labelling rules.
That leaves Stevia and the sweetener extracted from this plant, stevioside, which has also been thoroughly examined by the Scientific Committee on Food.
The committee has serious doubts about the safety of stevioside and does not consider it acceptable for use in food.
The Commission, therefore, has never proposed this sweetener for authorisation.
No new scientific data justifying a re-evaluation of stevioside have been presented to the Commission.
To summarise, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, but cannot accept Amendment No 4.
Â Â  â Mr President, allow me to start by extending a warm thanks to Mrs Ferreira for the good cooperation.
Our examination of this document went exceptionally well.
A balanced compromise has been struck with the Council and it is this compromise that will, if all goes well, be adopted tomorrow, for which many thanks.
I should like to make three comments with regard to the discussion of what is, in fact, a minor legislative proposal.
These comments should also be observed in future.
What irritates me is that we in this House are sometimes inclined to twist things that have been scientifically proven, in order to adapt them to political statements or political sentiments.
This is what Parliament does, and it annoys me.
However â and I am also addressing this to the Commissioner, for I have also had a run-in about this with your officials â the Commission does not get off completely scot-free on this score either.
They resembled political weather vanes to some extent.
In my opinion, we should involve ourselves with matters that have been passed on to us by independent science, and not what we find politically agreeable.
So much for my first comment.
The second may equally come across as a little abrasive and is addressed to the German and Austrian bakers and the Italian pastry cooks.
Because of them, the discussion was very gruelling, because they thought that we would overlook their products.
Last Thursday, I rang them up and asked them whether they had read the original Commission document.
Had they read it, they would have seen that a separate category had already been inserted for energy-reduced products.
They made our lives very difficult on that score.
A lot of discussion eventually turned out not to be necessary.
Finally, I should like to make a comment with regard to Mr Lannoyeâs Amendment No 4.
In this amendment, a request is made, among others, for a report about the re-evaluation of the licence for aspartame.
This strikes me as entirely superfluous, because everything on this subject is sufficiently dealt with in compromise Amendment No 2.
Moreover, as the Commissioner mentioned again a moment ago, this sweetener was evaluated extensively in December.
This therefore means that we should adhere to these results.
I fail to understand why Parliament then comes trotting along with the safety issue of another sweetener, stevia â which the Commissioner also touched on a moment ago â of which scientific evidence proves the contrary of what is claimed in the amendment.
On that score too, I urge you to be led by independent scientific research in future and be less swayed by the political issues of the day, because that way, I think we will arrive at the best legislation.
My thanks, once again, to the rapporteur.
Â Â  Mr President, I am delighted that this debate has taken the form it has.
I think that shows that in this debate at least, sweeteners can be a '' as well!
The rapporteur has steered this debate impeccably through the difficulties that we often encounter with these comparatively small arguments.
The problem very often is that they turn into the legislative equivalent of a Venus Flytrap.
You hover around them and suddenly you are sucked in and find enormous difficulties.
I believe that the three amendments the Commission has accepted are the right ones.
I think it is completely satisfactory for us that we have a period of review, that we have avoided the problems that we suspected in comitology and that, as Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has said, we have been able to support and not needlessly challenge the opinion of the scientific committees.
That is why I think Mr Lannoye's amendment was an amendment too far in that direction.
It is not our job always to say, after there has been scientific appraisal, that is not good enough, and there should be further appraisal immediately.
If you do that you devalue the work of the scientific committees, introduce an atmosphere of suspicion and end up with an unsatisfactory proposal.
So I am delighted that we have moved in this direction.
I am delighted also that we have reduced the level of cyclamates that can be used because of all our concerns about the exploitation of children and the way they now consume a variety of sweetened products.
Finally I should say to the Commission in particular that if we could, in all circumstances, treat these small but important debates seriously but without the kind of hysteria that we sometimes get on either side, this Parliament would be a happier and a wiser place.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Ferreira, on her excellent work and her excellent cooperation throughout the process of this matter. It concerns a subject which it has to be said is technical and does not mean a great deal to citizens, but nevertheless it should be of great interest to consumers, in any case the increasing number who are fighting the battle against sugar and calories, but also against dental caries among children.
What we are talking about here is improving welfare by authorising tomorrow the sale of two new sweeteners throughout the Union: sucralose and salt of aspartame-acesulfame, which have at least three characteristics in common: they have no safety problems (it has been confirmed and reconfirmed that they are harmless, as has already been said), they are easier to apply (they dissolve more quickly and can better withstand higher temperatures) and also they have a far superior sweetening capacity than traditional sugar.
These substances can therefore be useful for day-to-day foods, in particular for diabetics and those suffering from obesity.
With regard to cyclamate, a Danish study showed that excess consumption of it can be harmful for the weakest among us, pregnant women and children under the age of three.
It is therefore a good thing that the maximum dose of cyclamate has been reduced.
Regarding the three amendments adopted in Committee, although we have been forced to water down our position, we should welcome the compromise, which was reached between the three institutions and therefore means that we can avoid the conciliation procedure.
As at first reading, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will not, however, vote for Amendment No 4 tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance asking for a re-evaluation of the authorisation of aspartame.
We trust the opinions given by the European Scientific Committee, which is an entirely independent body, and the opinions given on many occasions by many national authorities confirming that the sweetener is harmless.
As there are nevertheless some reports of problems following over consumption of aspartame, we wish to remain vigilant and our rapporteur has explained how we can do so.
I am also pleased to note that the common position has established an obligation to label salt of aspartame-acesulfame, thus relieving the concerns that were expressed by some of us at first reading.
To conclude, as Mrs Ferreira said, I would like to say that there are some quite frustrating aspects to this debate.
It certainly does not answer the vital, or rather I would say priority question of the merit of these false sugars.
Are they really a good thing for everyone, are there really no dangers to health, and I am talking hear in the broader sense and in the long term, do they really help combat obesity or, on the contrary, do they maintain the taste for sugar, whether genuine or false?
There are so many questions that are only partially dealt with, although I would like to state to conclude that the Liberal Group is entirely satisfied with the results obtained from the questions that were on the table.
Â Â  â Mr President, todayâs debate on the second reading of the sweeteners directive typifies a development that I regard with increasing disquiet and grave concern.
The Commission justifies change in terms of the state of the art in technology and science.
I too am in favour of scientific progress, but not everything that appears to be an improvement is actually in the consumerâs best interests.
I ask myself what will be the end result when the food industry produces food by refining, to a high level, animal and vegetable raw materials and by the use of thousands of synthetic flavourings, and is able to take these processes almost to extremes.
Our daily food intake is being taken over by pharmacists, chemists and genetic engineers.
Whilst I cannot and will not put up with this situation, it is evident that someone is making money out of it, and it is for precisely that reason, and in the interests of public health, that it is an absolute necessity that food directives should rest on a scientific basis.
The assessment of risks is, however, being made ever more complex and problematic by increases in the depth of processing and in the diversity of the procedures and additives used, while, at the same time, legislation becomes out of date more quickly.
Turning specifically to the subject of the recommendation adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, there are two comments I would like to make.
I endorse Amendment No 1a to the effect that all sweeteners should be re-evaluated within as short a time as possible before the directive enters into force.
My reasoning is that I believe that the warning by sceptical scientists associating aspartame with tumours cannot simply be dismissed, the all-clear sounded by the official scientific committee on food notwithstanding.
Whilst I have every confidence in the choices scientists make, I do take the view that the specifics of threshold values have to be handled with care and on a methodologically justified basis.
I endorse Amendment No 3 because setting a definite deadline for the distribution of stocks of products that are no longer permitted can prevent these products from being got over the counter quickly.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish firstly to say that I really appreciate Mrs Ferreiraâs work.
I also support her proposals, for example when it comes to our not being able to accept the Commissionâs deciding alone which substances constitute sweeteners.
Nor can it be reasonable that a substance considered dangerous and not to be approved should be sold until stocks are exhausted.
Health must come first in this case.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance think that AmendmentÂ NoÂ 2 (Article 1a (new)) is far too general and that it focuses too much on the new sweeteners.
In our AmendmentÂ NoÂ 4, we want the Commission to present a report regarding a re-evaluation of the authorisation granted in respect of the sweetener aspartame.
There is comprehensive criticism from independent experts who question the fact that the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) has given the green light to aspartame.
According to the criticism, the Scientific Committee has ignored critical and independent investigations and perhaps let itself be influenced by the food industry or the aspartame manufacturers.
We cannot disregard the fact that there is information that should prompt a reaction on our part if we want the precautionary principle to apply and protect peopleâs health.
There is a recently written report from Spain showing that aspartame formaldehyde accumulates in cells, something that may destroy DNA and, for example, cause liver or brain damage, especially in the case of people vulnerable to such damage.
To use Mrs Oomen-Ruijtenâs words: the political winds are blowing from both right and left in this House this evening.
That cannot, however, prevent us, in the Greens/ALE Group, from requesting that the arguments be examined once more and the precautionary principle applied when the researchers disagree and come up with different positions.
I therefore appeal to my fellow MEPs in actual fact to vote in favour of AmendmentÂ NoÂ 4 tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, I join in the general congratulations of Mrs Ferreira on reaching what is a sensible and welcome compromise on this revision of the directive.
I certainly support her final tweaks of the text in the three amendments that she has put forward.
However, I have to say to Mrs SchÃ¶rling that I cannot accept Mr Lannoye's fourth amendment.
It is unrealistic and it is one that he tried at first reading.
When I criticised it at that point, his response was that 'it showed that knowledge can develop and that development sometimes leads us to question the authorisations that were given previously'.
Well, many regulatory bodies across the world have evaluated aspartame and none have come forward with evidence that suggests that knowledge has developed in such a way as to doubt previous authorisations.
So, are we to keep on re-evaluating the evidence until we get the result that Mr Lannoye wants?
Where are the wide criticisms of the SCF opinion?
Have any Member State competent bodies contradicted it?
Has the World Health Organisation contradicted it?
Who are we to believe â a large number of national regulatory bodies, legally responsible and accountable for examining evidence objectively on the basis of science or, for example, the Internet campaign that we have seen only this week suggesting that the tragic ferry accident at Staten Island in New York was somehow due to aspartame?
Scaremongering of this sort can only undermine public confidence in the bodies set up to protect our food and our health.
With such widespread consensus from regulatory bodies, it seems wasteful to divert the overstretched EFSA from meaningful work into an endless cycle of re-evaluation.
There are safety considerations with the use of aspartame.
If you look at the UK Food Standard Agency guidance it says that there is a small group of people who cannot safely consume aspartame.
They are the sufferers of the inherited disease PKU, who are unable to metabolise the amino acid phenylaline.
Since aspartame was also a source of this, all food products containing aspartame are clearly labelled to that effect, as the Commissioner said.
That is the right way to tackle this issue.
It is time that we restored some perspective to this and stopped undermining the work of our regulatory bodies.
It is time to listen to the scientists and not the scaremongers.
I commend Mrs Ferreira's report as it stands, with the Commissioner's proposals.
I hope that is now acceptable to Parliament.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question (O-0066/2003 â B5-0281/2003) byMr Gargani, Mr Rothley, Mr Lehne and Mr Manders, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to the Commission, on the German deposit system.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was, at first, only people in Germany who had to endure what was termed deposits on cans but ought, more accurately to be termed the enforced deposit.
Now people throughout Europe are being sore tried by the amateurish approach adopted in Germany, and so the European Peopleâs Party has supported the Liberal groupâs request to have this oral question put on Parliamentâs agenda.
Commissioner Bolkestein was right to reveal on television that those of us who live in Germany are currently in a state of chaos as a result of the deposit imposed on cans.
Five different systems currently operate across Germany to administer this deposit, but they cover only some 10% of the overall German market.
Alongside them there are the so-called individual systems, operating on a regional basis or limited to particular chains of supermarkets, but, as these do not constitute a self-sufficient whole, their effect is to wholly fragment the can deposit system.
Such a result was only to be expected.
I do not want to say anything about the discrimination against certain German firms within Germany, as that is not â unfortunately â a pan-European issue, but is for the Bundestag in Berlin to deal with.
I just want to say something about the discrimination that is going on in Europe.
Article 28 obliges every Member State to guarantee free trade, and this article is being quite openly breached.
The Commission has received masses of complaints, especially from small and medium-sized businesses, and, in particular, from those based in the Benelux countries, Italy, France and Austria.
Quite apart from these complaints, there has also been a great deal of disruption in Germany.
It is estimated that German consumers have lost some EURÂ 500 million through having had to pay a deposit somewhere or other, but not having had the opportunity to cash in their deposit tokens at the same place later on and thus get their deposit back.
You â any consumer â can easily get practical experience of this.
All you need to do is to buy a drink at a service station and then drive off.
If you never go back to that service station, you will never be able to return the can or bottle that you bought there and will never get back the deposit that you paid on it.
That is how, in only a few months, the consumer ends up with a loss of EURÂ 500 million.
In Germany, the estimate loss in terms of jobs alone amounts to 10Â 000, all lost as a result of this incompetence.
I might add that I have not invented these figures or been given them by some organisation or other; they come from the German Federal Ministry of the Economy, which is part of the same Federal Government that has to take responsibility for all these goings-on.
It is reckoned that this nonsense will cost a further 15Â 000 jobs across the EU.
All this leads us to welcome the Commissionâs decision to commence, today, proceedings against the Federal Republic of Germany for infringement of the Treaties.
It is evident, by the way, that the celebrated telephone conversations between Brussels and Berlin have been ineffective and that the Chancellorâs phone call to MrÂ Prodi has obviously availed him nothing.
Perhaps that has something to do with our getting this oral question onto Parliamentâs agenda for this evening, and this eveningâs deliberations have perhaps accelerated the Commissionâs thinking processes and steered them closer to Commissioner Bolkesteinâs proposals.
This is very much to be welcomed.
I do not want to deny that I, myself, am fundamentally sceptical about the idea of a deposit on cans.
If there is a political decision at national level to introduce a deposit on cans, then Europe will have to accept it, but the nation in question will have to get it right.
There are examples of how to do it properly.
There are can deposit systems in Scandinavia, but they are unitary systems with a standardised returns facility, and do not have a discriminatory effect.
To put it quite bluntly, the German federal government is faced with the choice of either introducing such a system taking the necessary actions by means of regulations or legislation in Germany, or of simply doing away with the deposit on cans.
Such are the two alternatives before it.
If it does not do so, it risks not only ending up before the European Court of Justice in infringement proceedings set in motion by the Commission, but also faces the risk that aggrieved parties in the persons of businesses, manufacturers and even consumers will act on the more recent case-law of the European Court of Justice and commence public liability proceedings against it before German courts, which could then petition the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, with the possibility of claims running into millions, if not billions, in compensation, for which sums the German Minister of Finance would be liable.
That I would regard as a highly problematic situation, and so I can do no other that advise the German Federal Government to comply with the Commissionâs instructions and either create a system compatible with the internal market or abolish the deposit on cans.
This morning, I publicly urged the Commission, to help the German consumer, the manufacturers and the importers.
I am glad that it has done so.
This question is intended, above all, to support the Commission in its efforts at finally sorting out the chaos that this has brought to Germany.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of the above-mentioned issues.
It has analysed the matter and I can inform Parliament, as Mr Lehne has already mentioned, that this morning the Commission decided to send a letter of formal notice to the German Government because the Commission considers that it has infringed Article 28 of the Treaty and Article 7 of Directive 94/62/EC.
May I stress that the Commission is not questioning the setting up of a deposit system as such, but rather the modalities under which this is occurring.
The reasons for this are as follows: firstly, there are no nationwide return systems.
At present the two systems deemed to be nationwide, Lekkerland-Tobaccoland and VFV, have a market share of no more than 12% of the beverages which are subject to the deposit.
Furthermore, they mostly cover small kiosks and canteens with a sales area of less than 200 square metres.
Under the relevant law, these smaller outlets have a legal obligation to take back empty bottles and cans of the 'same type, shape and size', but only of the same brands which they themselves sell.
Second, the so-called individual solutions â in German â pose a continuous problem to intra-Community trade.
They are a direct result of the relevant German law under which the obligation for bigger retailers to take back empty packaging applies only to packaging of the same type, shape and size as that which they sell.
Today a number of individual solutions exist and they pose serious problems.
This provision in German law induces major retail chains to force European producers to modify the packaging of their products and the European Court of Justice holds that, when EU producers are obliged to modify their packaging in order to market their products, that fact alone amounts to a barrier to intra-Community trade.
Extra costs are incurred and the import of products becomes more burdensome.
Third, the systems are not all fully interoperable.
Indeed, on the one hand, for the growing number of individual solutions there is no legal obligation to take back packaging which belongs to any of the other collection systems, even if this differs only slightly from the one that they sell.
Furthermore, as far as the interoperability between VFV and Lekkerland-Tobaccoland is concerned, it appears that a number of technical issues have not yet been settled.
For example, it is still not clear how a financial clearing of the deposits between several systems will work.
Fourth, delisting persists and one-way products that are not an individual solution are not to be found on the shelves of certain stores.
We have firm evidence that several major retail chains in Germany have delisted.
Importers from other European countries are particularly affected by this, as they sell their drinks almost exclusively in one-way packaging for reasons mainly related to long-distance deliveries.
Perhaps in the case of a number of existing individual solutions, some well-established importers do not necessarily suffer in their protected arrangements, but this does not compensate for the major losses incurred through the substantial decline in imports from other Member States as a result of this fragmentation of the German market for these products.
Therefore the Commission has now decided to issue a letter of formal notice in which it raises these and some other questions and it has asked the German Government to reply to those questions and to provide a justification for the measures undertaken.
Â Â  â Mr President, let me start by extending warm thanks to Commissioner Bolkestein for the fundamental criticism he has very expertly levelled with regard to the German system and for the way in which other Member States can also draw lessons from this when they do not think first before they act.
I have the feeling that Mr Trittin, whom I saw briefly on television this evening, has not yet grasped this notion.
He acts indiscriminately and does not think about what the implications for Europe could be.
The Commissioner has given a clear analysis on this and I think we should all be pleased that a solution to the problem now seems to be in sight.
Ever since April, we have asked questions about this issue.
On 1 July, we asked questions on this matter during the debate on packaging waste and, Mr Bolkestein, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m then answered on your behalf that an enquiry would be launched.
The real question is this: why have we had to wait so long, from 1 July to 21 October, for formal infringement proceedings?
Industry is being seriously hampered by this German measure and is now asking how long it will take before the problem will be solved.
Not only the German consumers suffer, all those foreign tourists who, via the German , spend their holidays somewhere in Germany or even further afield, also suffer under the system.
A lot of money is simply left unclaimed.
These consumers are also asking when this problem will now be solved.
Secondly, when I look at my region, the Brabant and Limburg region, I notice that particularly in areas where there is a lot of cross-border movement, even smaller businesses that supply soft drinks, water or beer, often in non-reusable packaging, have suffered a loss in turnover of more than 30 to 40%.
The Commissioner claims that, strictly speaking, it is possible, even under current procedures, for these businesses to claim damages.
This is all well and good, but these small businesses wonder how long they will survive when a large proportion of their market is being closed off.
The Dutch market, the Austrians, the Belgians and the French rely on this German market to a large extent.
If it remains closed for too long, then this is very bad and we may well make things difficult for ourselves.
That is why I am urging the Commissioner to make every effort to speed things up, so that the system is actually withdrawn.
Mr Trittin failed to indicate in so many words that that was his intention, but I would ask you to pull out all the stops.
What is the timeframe we should be looking at?
I should, in fact, also like to thank you for the efforts you have made.
I have to say that the adequate response is very positive for the internal market in Europe.
We are all in favour of this internal market, which is not only beneficial to the consumers, but where industry can, and should, gain a great deal.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe that tonightâs discussion contains an internal German political element.
In other words, there is a confrontation between political parties and much of the blame for the fact that we are having this discussion tonight lies with these German politicians.
Specifically, we must remember that, in 1991, the German Christian Democrat Government, when Klaus TÃ¶pfer was minister, introduced a regulation on packaged goods, which took shape in 1998 under the Environment Minister, Angela Merkel, of the CDU, and in 2001 an attempt to improve this regulation failed because the majority of the CDU in the Bundesrat blocked it, and it was therefore not possible to establish a suitable system for recovering packaging.
In any event, I believe that the German Government has taken the bull by the horns and is trying to resolve a problem which today affects the whole of the European Union.
The question I would like to ask the Commissioner is to what extent the Commission and the institutions of the European Union are failing to fulfil their duty when they do not propose or adopt Community legislation to prevent this accumulation of solid waste, which is currently making it very difficult to organise the work â in cities, for example â with enormous costs for local authorities in terms of providing these resources.
I will tell you an anecdote, for example, about how on my island, which is a small island with 300 volcanoes, we began to use a volcano and it is almost full already and, in this way, before long we will not have volcanoes, but mounds of rubbish.
I have the feeling, Mr President, that at the moment, and despite the fact that I think it is right for the Commission to try to harmonise measures, we must remember Articles 174 and 176 of the European Union Treaty â which are in place â which, on the one hand, empower the States to adopt measures to better protect the environment, but on the other, encourage the Community institutions to adopt general measures, so that a problem as serious as the one we have today with the accumulation of solid waste can be resolved in the only rational way, which is the Community way.
I would therefore urge the Commissioner to analyse the possibility of achieving Community legislation to harmonise the situation, and I believe that we must not restrict ourselves to using an internal political problem to cause difficulties for a European Union government.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on the news that has already reached us via the television and to which he responded a moment ago.
I hope that this Liberal initiative, which, by the way, received unanimous support in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has helped you to reach your decision.
Given the timeframe, it looks like it was of some help.
I would like to concur with Mr Medina Ortega that we are not, in principle, opposed to a deposit system.
If we want a deposit system, it would perhaps be helpful within one internal market if we were to introduce a harmonised Community system, as a result of which all businesses and all consumers within one Europe would know where they stand.
We are against a restricting deposit system, and the voucher system in Germany does not belong in serious legislation but rather on a fairground, where it entitles you to a few rides on the merry-go-round, but not to do a few laps in Germany.
As far as this is concerned, we are pleased with your announcement that you are going to intervene.
What I would like to know is whether you could indicate whether it is possible to force, or at least implore, the German Government to suspend the current system with immediate effect?
This should happen in any event until a European-wide system has been introduced, or at least a system that complies with the current framework, so that Article 28 would not be violated.
This is my first request.
Secondly, can you confirm whether it is true â as MrÂ Lehne claimed â that businesses that have suffered enormous losses, but also perhaps consumers, could recoup the damage from the German Government, for example?
I hope that with this measure that you announced, German consumers will very soon again be able to choose freely between such European products as Badoit water, San Pellegrino or Bavaria beer.
If this were possible, then I hope that after these ten months of being deprived of these enjoyable European products, the European market will once again be open and that it can help complete the internal market.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament made it quite clear when we debated the Sixth Environmental Action Programme that our advocacy of reusable packaging is based on considerations of environmental policy.
Our experience in Germany shows that this system has demonstrated its ecological steering function, in that fewer cans are spoiling the environment.
So, when you say on the one hand, that you are not against cans, I agree with you, but I cannot quite understand why, on the other hand, you apply double standards.
I am no more satisfied than you are with these individual solutions; we would all have preferred a standardised system.
You will be aware, though, that it is not policymakers who bear responsibility in this instance; massive pressure was exerted by industry, especially by traders.
Now we see individual solutions in Spain and Portugal too.
I would like to ask you, Commissioner, why you allow individual solutions in two Member States but not in another.
When you tell us how you are not opposed to deposits on cans, and how the environmental action programme has shown you to be a firm advocate of reusability, I really do ask myself why we in the European Union do not do what has just been referred to, and introduce harmonisation, thereby making a statement about our desire to improve the environment and also to increase the reuse of packaging, firstly, because it really does play an ecological role, and, secondly, because reusability â as we know â makes jobs safer.
Why, for the sake of preventing waste, do we not go ahead and make reusable packaging mandatory throughout the European Union?
That would make your arguments consistent with each other.
If we do not, then many will get the impression that we really are applying double standards, with individual solutions being permitted in some Member States but not in Germany.
That is something on which I would like an answer from you.
You must not, of course, give the impression that what the current state of affairs is primarily about is mounting a campaign against Germanyâs environmental policy decisions; on the contrary, the Commission, too, must demonstrate that it wants environmental integration.
If you, Commissioner, are a supporter of the internal market, then it is your duty as much as anyone elseâs to have an integrated approach to environmental policy.
Avoiding the piling-up of rubbish means backing reusability, for that is what we have decided in the environmental action programme and on many occasions in Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, we all support recycling although it must be planned sensibly so that it does not cause more environmental damage than it saves.
We also all support the waste hierarchy where it is best to prevent, it is next best to re-use and recycle, and after that comes energy recovery.
For recycling, we welcome public education schemes and voluntary schemes.
We have no problem with the German Government if it goes down these roads, or indeed down the Scandinavian nationwide road.
However, it has chosen to go down an imposed route without consideration for customers or indeed for other EU countries.
It is not just a German domestic problem: it is an Austrian problem, a Belgian, Dutch, French, Luxembourgish, Italian, Swedish and British problem.
All these countries have been affected by this decision.
Markets and jobs have been lost and consumers are the losers, whether as a result of the import blockade or the inability to recover their deposits.
There is virtually no gain for the environment in this scheme.
Non-compliance with internal market directives threatens the economic success of the European Union and I very much support Mr Bolkenstein's action and hope that this leads swiftly to German compliance.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by congratulating the German Government on its ambitions.
It is of the utmost importance for there to be governments that are progressive in the environmental field and that are not frightened to take controversial measures.
Everyone can level well-founded criticism at the German deposit system.
I share this criticism and I will return to this in more detail in a moment.
However, before I do this, I should like to emphasise how important it is to take courageous decisions, political decisions, with which consumers can clearly identify.
For months, we have been droning on about the Packaging Directive, about whether the objective should be 55% or 60% and whether the system should be introduced in 2008 or 2007.
It is therefore refreshing if a government has the nerve to be a trendsetter and stick its neck out.
Of course, one or two things are up for criticism, and there is room for improvement in terms of the way in which it has been introduced, but I would also like to point out that those who have submitted this question are now shedding crocodile tears.
During the review of the Packaging Directive, amendments were tabled to solve the internal market problems.
In these, it was proposed only to permit deposit systems if the environment were to gain from this in a demonstrable manner.
In other words, a good environmental reason had to be given for infringements of the internal market.
This amendment did not make it because the Liberals and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party voted against it.
The German deposit system â as most Germans agree â is not an attractive solution.
It is very annoying to have to return your tins to the place where you bought them.
There is less unanimity when we consider the impact on employment and the market.
The German system leads to a clear shift from tin cans to other packaging, which, in turn, is not fair on the industries involved.
In my view, this would still be justifiable if an environmental goal were to be served by it, but this is not the case.
The loss of employment outside of Germany is now forming a disproportionate burden on a large number of sectors.
The Commission has proven to be a flexible and understanding partner, but patience can, and does, wear thin in the end.
It is now time for action in Berlin and, consequently, also for the Commission.
This happened this morning, for which I am grateful.
We also need a political solution, however.
The Court caused a great deal of commotion with the Packaging Directive by excluding waste incineration from recovery.
The German deposit system can also result in a legal conflict, which is always undesirable politically speaking.
This would be difficult to explain to consumers lugging their tin cans or to workers losing their jobs.
To solve political failure, the Commission, Parliament and the Council must come up with a solution of their own that is structural.
I am urging the Commission to take the initiative in its own hands and provide clear legislation.
Only then can we ensure that infringements of the law can be acted upon immediately.
The problems with the German deposit system do not stand in isolation.
We have had major problems in the past.
Deposit money was often used as a disguised form of protectionism in favour of the countryâs own products, for which there is no excuse whatsoever.
Commissioner, I should like to ask you a few more questions.
What are the options, in your mind, to eliminate these problems once and for all?
Is the Commission prepared to cooperate to amend the Packaging Directive via a fast-track procedure, so that these problems can be resolved?
Â Â  â Disposable cans are not environmentally sound.
The environmental burden of re-usable plastic bottles is two to three times lower, and so, environmentally speaking, a deposit system is a good way of reducing litter.
At the moment, deposits are payable on disposable cans throughout Sweden, the whole of Denmark and all of Germany.
The Commission, the Liberals and also the Christian Democrats are not averse to the principle of deposit systems.
This is an improvement.
Unfortunately, Mr Lehne stands outside of this consensus.
The deposit system also exists in parts, and I repeat in parts, of Spain and Portugal.
The Commission is not summoning Spain and Portugal before a European court.
In the Netherlands too, you cannot take all returnable bottles to all supermarkets.
The Commission has been put under pressure by campaigns from businesses and from elements in this House.
This shows once again that the Commission sets greater store by the internal market than by the environment.
In ten states and in some fifteen large cities in the United States too, âislandâ solutions have been provided in the form of local and regional deposit systems.
The fact that Germany happens to have an unsuccessful system, under which you cannot return your tin cans to any shop, has to do with the boycott campaigns by large sections of industry, which are opposed to the deposit system principle.
Irony has it that historically, they all have their origins in an act dating back to 1991 that was submitted by a Christian Democrat Environment Minister, Klaus TÃ¶pfer, which the present Minister, Mr Trittin, a Green, is now simply implementing.
Germany will eventually make it easier to get the deposit money refunded in different places.
This deposit system will then become very common.
The Commission should, in fact, propose the introduction of deposit systems throughout Europe.
We should let children and junkies earn a few euros on the back of the idleness of parents and their fellow citizens.
This is preferable to the situation in the Netherlands, where EUR 80 million is being squandered on a pointless advertising campaign entitled âNederland schoonâ â Keep The Netherlands Clean.
Â Â  . Mr President, I know it is late but I should like very briefly to reply to some of the questions that have been put.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten asked me why it took so long to start an infringement procedure against Germany.
The answer is that the Commission wanted to give the German Government every opportunity to explain its actions and to redress the situation.
There has been a lot of correspondence back and forth and Minister Tritin has visited Brussels.
This has been done in order to give the German Government the opportunity to change this unsatisfactory situation.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten further asked how long it will take to solve the problem.
This depends on the German Government.
At this moment the Commission can do no more than it has already done.
Mr Medina Ortega asked why there should not be a European solution.
In my view, the subsidiarity principle provides that, in this case, since it is not really a cross-border situation, it is up to Member States to take the requisite action.
Mr Manders asked whether it would be possible for the German Government to suspend the present rules.
That is precisely what the Commission has asked the German Government to do.
Until now, the German Government has not wanted to do so and that is why the Commission has now decided to start infringement proceedings.
Furthermore, Mr Manders asked whether it would be possible for companies to sue the German Government to get compensation for the losses they have had.
That depends on the law of the Member States concerned â in this case German law.
It is not the duty of this Commissioner to make a pronouncement on German law and therefore we must wait to see what will happen with the companies that have suffered losses.
Mrs Breyer asked why I attacked the individual solutionsthe .
These have lead to a break-up of the German market, and that is obviously contrary to the spirit of the internal market.
She also mentioned Spain and Portugal in this connection.
We have not had complaints about Spain and Portugal; in the case of Germany we had 50 complaints from 10 Member States.
Mrs Corbey said that the Commission should see to it that the German legislation is transparent.
The result of the Commission's infringement proceedings should indeed be that German legislation becomes clearer.
At the moment, the legislation, and in particular the way it is implemented, is anything but clear.
Lastly, Mrs Corbey wanted a definitive solution to this problem.
Once again, as I said earlier, that depends on the reactions of the German Government.
The Commission would like nothing more than to see a final solution to this problem.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

The Commission is able to accept the following amendments: NosÂ 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12.
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: NosÂ 2, 7, 8 and 13

The Commission is able to accept the following amendments, at least in principle (NosÂ 20 and 21) or in part (NosÂ 11, 17 and 18)
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: NosÂ 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 40.
The Commission is able to accept the following amendments, provided they are somewhat reworded: NosÂ 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32.
The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: NosÂ 3, 6, 8, 9 and 12.
The Commission is able to accept the ten amendments tabled by the European Parliament.
The Commission can fully accept Amendments Nos 5 and 20, as well as Amendments Nos 7, 14, 18 and 21 in their spirit, with some wording adaptations.
The Commission believes these amendments will improve the text of the proposal.
The Commission, however, is not in a position to accept any of the other proposed amendments, for the reasons set out below.
A first group of amendments impinges upon matters related with civil, police or judicial legislation.
Even if the Commission can understand the underlying concern which inspires them, they go beyond the specific scope of the motor insurance directives.
This is the case of Amendments Nos 4 and 19 on the harmonisation of the prescription deadline of the direct right of action, as well as of Amendments Nos 8 and 24 aimed at creating a central office in each Member State which would collect police reports of accidents.
Amendments Nos 3, 13, 25, 27 and 28 â which deals with the minimum amounts of insurance cover â provide for a global amount per accident for personal injuries, which the Commission believes is too low to cover accidents involving several victims.
These amounts, however, seem too high where there only one or few victims are involved in an accident.
For this reason the Commission proposal does not provide for global amounts per accident with regard to personal injuries and introduces new minimum amounts which substantially increase the protection of the victims of accidents without disregarding the situation of the market and the current level of protection in the Member States.
Although transitional periods on this matter cannot be excluded, it would be premature at this stage of the negotiation to provide for transitional periods which have not yet been formally requested by the relevant Member States in Council.
With regard to Amendments Nos 2, 12 and 22 which aim at ensuring that the cost of legal proceedings should be covered by compulsory insurance, the system of payment of judicial costs in legal proceedings is very different across the Member States.
While in some countries lawyers are allowed to perceive a percentage of the compensation granted by the court to the victim, in others this system of percentages is forbidden.
Compulsory cover of legal costs by insurance might encourage abusive lawsuits instead of out-of-court settlement of accidents and have an impact on the increase of the cost of insurance in a number of Member States.
Furthermore, this insurance cover would overlap with the voluntary insurance regulated in Directive 87/344/EEC on legal expenses insurance.
The Commission is also not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 1, 6, 9 and 23 as the real effect of these amendments is not clear.
Trailers, independently of their weight, are already expressly covered by the insurance directives within the definition of vehicles and are therefore subject to compulsory insurance.
Any problem relating to the identification or registration of vehicles cannot be solved within the framework of an insurance directive.
Amendments Nos 11 and 26, aimed at maintaining the current derogation for certain special vehicles in the insurance directives â only applied by very few Member States â are not acceptable unless they are accompanied by a guarantee that any victim of accidents caused by these vehicles is duly compensated.
The amendments rely on the presentation of a proof of insurance at the border, but since the phase-out of cross-border checks following Schengen, this no longer provides such a guarantee.
Amendments Nos 10, 16 and 17 cannot be retained either.
Amendment No 10 allows, in any circumstance, insurance checks of vehicles based in another Member State.
This could adversely affect the free circulation of vehicles.
Amendment No 16, on temporary stays of vehicles outside the Member State in which is based, subject the duration of the insurance cover to national laws on registration of vehicles.
The proposal aims to ensure that the insurance is maintained for the agreed term of the contract without prejudice to the obligation to register the vehicle, which is based on national tax law and remains untouched.
Amendment No 17 provides for an optional derogation of the criterion of localisation of risks which may lead to administrative confusion with regard to the authorities responsible to control the obligation of insuring a vehicle.
Amendment No 15 aims to delete the provision contained in the Commission proposal improving the protection of pedestrians.
It would be regrettable for the European Parliament not to support the Commission on a matter which affects the most vulnerable road users.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure today to welcome His Excellency DrÂ Wade, President of the Republic of Senegal.
My pleasure is all the greater because this is the first time an African president has spoken to a plenary sitting since the beginning of the current legislature, and even since 1999, with the exception of speeches by the leaders of the Mashreq and Maghreb countries.
Mr President, in the course of your long political career, you have earned universal respect, not only throughout the African continent but also across the world, and, as the charismatic father of Senegalâs parliamentary opposition, you became a model for democrats across Africa.
Through all of those years, at no time did you lose faith in the parliamentary system and your determination to implement democratic principles never wavered.
By setting such an example, you have inspired everyone who believes in democracy and in the power of the ballot box.
Your election to the position of Head of State is a sign of the new democratic current running through Africa.
As President of the Republic of Senegal, you have worked tirelessly to achieve democracy and peace in Africa.
You were one of the founders of the New Partnership for Africaâs Development and you have spared no effort to resolve the conflicts raging in numerous African countries, from Madagascar to CÃŽte-d'Ivoire, which has earned you international respect.
The commitment that you have shown, Mr President, to regional integration and to establishing closer economic and political links between the countries of Africa, through the African Union, in order to improve the quality of life of the men and women who live on your continent, reflects the aspirations that led to the creation of the European Union itself.
The European Parliament, which is committed to promoting and staunchly defending democracy throughout the world, is honoured to welcome a statesman of your eminence, whose long political career has been characterised throughout by a deep respect for democratic principles and for the Rule of Law.
Consequently, I am delighted to invite you, Mr President, to speak to the European Parliament.
Â Â  . â Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to open my speech by thanking you most sincerely for having invited me to address your noble House.
I am fully aware of the significance of this honour and the citizens of Senegal and of Africa will I am sure, understand that this honour is intended for their entire continent, which is often ignored, but is today invited to express itself through my humble person.
I also wish to thank you, however, for having contributed, on more than one occasion in the past, to calling for my freedom, which had been denied me when, during the twenty-six years I spent as a member of the opposition, I had at times to deal with an authority that had little respect for democracy and human rights and which interrogated me, arrested me or threw me into prison according to its whim.
The Parliament in Strasbourg adopted numerous threatening resolutions demanding my release.
This somewhat strange experience has led me, as Senegalâs Head of State, to ensure that a number of provisions were adopted, not least in the Constitution, concerning the protection of religious minorities, â making it compulsory for the State itself to protect them â womenâs rights, including for example access to land for women, because that was a problematic issue, equal rights to employment for men and women and many other provisions, such as criminal penalties for sexual mutilation.
I also wish, following on from this brief description of something that is clearly revolutionary, since no Constitution has ever contained provisions of this nature, to tell you that I have added to the Constitution the right to demonstrate.
Given that during my time in the desert, our demonstrations were broken up with tear gas, I have ensured that Senegalâs Constitution states that all communities and groups who have anything they wish to express can go onto the streets and demonstrate with banners, ...
... provided that they observe the law.
I wish to tell you, furthermore, that the Liberal International will be holding its meeting in Dakar and that, of course, the opposition has taken this opportunity to hold a demonstration.
I hope this does not shock you if you join us on that extraordinary day.
I should like, ladies and gentlemen, to keep my speech relatively short because I intend to provide you with a document that will contain all the necessary information.
I therefore wish briefly to address the issue of cooperation between the European Union and Senegal, the set of problems relating to international trade, cooperation between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, the New Partnership for Africaâs Development (NEPAD), relations between the European Union and the African Union, peace and security.
Starting with the matter of cooperation with Senegal, I must say that it cannot be faulted.
The European Union is the major donor to Senegal; its presence is felt in all sectors of our economy â health, the road network, agriculture, decentralisation â and supports all our efforts to achieve sustainable growth.
I think I have said enough on the matter.
I will simply add that this cooperation with the European Union and with some countries such as France, together with international aid enabled us to achieve annual growth of 5.6% in 2001, unfortunately countered by the disastrous consequences of unseasonable rains affecting the north of our country.
We nevertheless managed to control the situation and, in 2002, we doubled the volume of private investment.
I have actually pursued a free market policy â as they say, only by putting the theory into practice will we see whether it works â to show that, in fact, development policy must be geared towards a massive appeal for private capital to help our development.
I know that many people do not agree with me on this point and I shall come back to it later.
Thank God, however, this liberal and proactive policy has borne fruit.
Last year, our corn production stood at no more than 100Â 000 tonnes.
I then set the target of oneÂ million tonnes, and everyone said that this was impossible and that it was a crazy project!
I can now tell you that we have now achieved half of our target, in other words 500Â 000 tonnes of corn, which has never happened in the entire history of Senegal, ...
... not to mention the remarkable increase seen in other crops such as sesame.
As for relations with the developed countries, our main problem, as you know, is that of subsidies.
I will only say one thing about this matter, because I already expressed my opinion in :we are in favour of free trade, providing it is fair trade
We are in favour of free trade.
We know that it is needed if the global economy is to develop â I am no longer talking only about Africa or Europe here â as is the development of world trade, of world production, trading, etc. we all know this, but it will only work if everyone observes the rules.
Unfortunately, the developed countries, including your own, breach these rules providing subsidies totalling USDÂ oneÂ billion per day.
I am not calling for subsidies to be abolished.
I am enough of a realist to know that European or US political leaders cannot simply tell their farmers tomorrow that they have given an international commitment and subsidies have been abolished.
This is not an option.
The United States accounts for almost 20% of world cotton production and 39% of world cotton exports.
In 2001, exporters from sub-Saharan African countries lost USDÂ 302Â million, of which two-thirds or EURÂ 191Â million came from the West African countries of Benin, BurkinaÂ Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, CÃŽte d'Ivoire, Mali and Togo.
These amounts might appear laughable to you but to us they are enormous.
As a result, my position is simply to advocate financial compensation until these subsidies are in fact abolished, since everyone claims to be in favour of abolishing them.
When PresidentÂ Bush passed through Dakar, he said to me: âI am in favour of abolishing subsidies.
If the Europeans abolish them, so will Iâ.
I replied âFine, Mr President, but until you do, we will still face major problemsâ.
What we are calling for, then, is financial compensation until subsidies are abolished.
With regard to the WTO, I dared to say, in the article to which I have referred, on the eve of the WTO meeting, that instead of a binding agreement that satisfies no one, it would be better to have no agreement at all and to take the time to discuss matters frankly.
I must say that today, quite frankly, I have no faith in the WTO.
I believe that things are now happening at such a widespread, global level, that attempting to find points on which everyone can agree is simply wishful thinking.
This is why what I recommend instead is direct competition between continents or sub-continents, like the competition between the European Union and the ACP countries or between the European Union and Africa.
I have faith in this formula that we established with you a very long time ago, only to abandon it later in order to move towards giving discussions a more global approach.
We know today that globalisation has reached a dead end and that we would need to return to the European Union-ACP, European Union-Africa formula. I am not saying that the results would be particularly spectacular, but I do have faith in this type of mechanism.
I have faith in the type of agreement that we concluded in Cotonou, on 23Â JanuaryÂ 2000, which introduces the requirement for enhanced political dialogue, without which there can be no economic cooperation.
It also promotes a participative approach which involves the private sector and civil society, getting poverty reduction underway. It streamlines cooperation instruments and creates a new framework for economic and trade cooperation by concluding new agreements designed to include all of these provisions in the world trade system gradually and harmoniously.
This is the type of agreement I believe in.
As to the results, they are the results that we have achieved.
I shall sum up by saying that the agreement between West Africa and the European Union, for example, provides for sums of around EURÂ 435Â million, which I believe to be quite inadequate.
Having said that, however, I still make a distinction between principles and money, etc. This is the stance that I have always adopted at the G8, and I have always said that the most important element is the commitment, the political will to deal with a given situation.
How we get there is another story.
Some people say that EURÂ 10Â billion is needed, others say EURÂ fiveÂ billion, but we must not condemn mechanisms and agreements simply because we have found the various contributions to be inadequate.
I shall say a few words about this in a while.
All of Africa is today set on the same course thanks to NEPAD, the âNew Partnership for Africaâs Developmentâ NEPAD is the fusion of the Millennium Partnership for the African Recovery Programme (MAP), drawn up by my brothers ThaboÂ Mbeki, OlusegunÂ Obasanjo and AbdelazizÂ Bouteflika and the OMEGA plan, proposed by Senegal.
What does MAP bring to the deal?
MAP draws our attention to the fact that Africa is not poor but has been impoverished; by three centuries of slavery, by colonisation and by an international mechanism that is today leading to poorer trading terms. MAP also appeals to the African renaissance.
The OMEGA plan, which I myself drafted, is essentially an economic plan, designed to show that we must focus on infrastructures, as the Europeans and the Americans have done and as Russia, at the time the Soviet Union, did.
This plan shows that without infrastructures, it is impossible even to develop agriculture, because it is impossible even to make the link between centres of production and centres of consumption or of export.
NEPAD raises the principle of mass development in Africa, so as to bridge the gulf that separates us from the developed countries and we believe that this can be done.
The problem is how to achieve this.
NEPAD bases its approach on three fundamental options that I shall call the long-term parameters.
The first of these is, of course, good public and private governance, without which public administration itself is impossible and without which we will never attract capital.
The second parameter consists of the regions.
Instead of relying on States, NEPAD relies on the regional dimension, which is larger and has a larger market, thereby allowing economies of scale to develop.
The third and last parameter is NEPADâs appeal to the private sector.
In this regard, I must say that whatever efforts are made, among other things, to provide aid and to cooperate, resources will never be sufficient, but on the other hand, if we offer the private sector the right conditions in which to invest in Africa, its actions will have the same influence as on the development of the developed countries, such as France, the United States, Canada, Japan and others.
In support of these three fundamental options, NEPAD selected eight sectors â infrastructure, education and training, health, agriculture, the new information and communication technologies, the environment, energy and, lastly, access to the markets of the developed countries.
Each of these sectors is considered to be a priority and we have drawn up all projects at regional, interregional or continental level.
The remaining question is how all this is to be funded?
I must say with regard to this matter that in May, when I stopped off in Japan, that country offered to write off EURÂ threeÂ billion dollarsâ worth of debt and this gesture was confirmed recently at the third Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD III). Japan also offered USDÂ 1.06Â billion for infrastructures, around USDÂ 600Â million for education and health and almost USDÂ 400Â million to support Japanese companies that wish to invest in Africa.
I am not going to focus on the health or education sectors, but I must say that I share the view that education and training constitute the key sector for development.
Incidentally, Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan and others are living proof of this, directing almost 70% of their budget towards education and training.
Malaysia dedicates 35% to these areas.
Since the change of government, Senegal has increased its budget for education, which now stands at almost 35%.
I hope to get it close to 50% before I leave office as Senegalâs Head of State.
One of NEPADâs concerns is digital solidarity.
I was invited to the preparatory meeting for the World Summit on the Information Society, which will be taking place in Geneva, and I proposed the concept of digital solidarity, which I should like to ask the European Parliament to support.
Incidentally, following several working meetings, on the recommendation of experts, this concept was adopted and forms part of the final draft resolution of the Conference, which will take place in Geneva, in December.
What is involved?
This is an attempt to find the means with which to help everyone who is cut off from the information society by providing equipment, such as telephones, Internet, web sites, in order to bring them up to the level of the information society that I defined on the basis of quantitative criteria, which have furthermore been accepted by the experts.
What precisely is involved?
What would happen is that â on a voluntary basis, because this is not a tax â between 2 and 5 dollars would go towards purchasing a computer or 4 or 5 dollars towards creating a web site.
Sums of money collected in this way could, according to estimates, be very considerable indeed âÂ several hundred million or even billions of dollars, â and would help to buy equipment from the North to equip the South.
Everyone would benefit â it is a real win-win situation: businesses in the West would supply their equipment and we would be able to use it.
I should like to conclude by saying that our action in Africa should be seen in the context of achieving peace and security, without which nothing can be done.
Today, unfortunately, there are still many conflict hot-spots: when one is put out, another erupts somewhere else, but we do try to keep them under control.
We have managed to control the conflicts in Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, where the situation remains tense and in Sierra Leone.
Unfortunately, we still have some concerns about Guinea-Conakry and Mauritania, in short, countries where elections are soon to be held.
I should like to draw a few brief conclusions.
It is not really wise to draw conclusions â it is more sensible to raise issues, but as it happens, I would like to close by expressing a conviction.
This conviction relates to the way in which we will be able to get out of the current situation.
Despite all of these aid programmes and programmes for cancelling or rescheduling debt â every possibility has been put forwardÂ â despite all of these efforts, we on the ground sometimes have the impression that we are living in the nineteenth century.
Proof of this is that everyone agrees today on the need to combat poverty, but has this poverty always existed, or has it been created?
I personally believe that this is a relative, and not absolute poverty, created by a new relationship between the underdeveloped and developed countries, which are going through a process of change.
Africaâs absolute needs today are no longer the same as they were in the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
It is therefore the entire issue of the interdependence of basic needs that must today be addressed through global relationships.
We must, consequently, observe and seek solutions, but without getting rid of what we have already, which can always be improved on.
In order to achieve all of this, I believe that we must appeal to the private sector, which has bolstered the development of Europe, the United States and Japan.
I think that we might be surprised at how much the private sector will help.
Countries must not be left completely unregulated, but we must, by means of national regulations, which everyone must respect, establish good governance and create security, or âprofitabilityâ which is the free transfer of profits.
Personally, I have faith in the free market, not a completely unbridled market, but free nonetheless, which sets me apart from some liberals who perhaps share some of the principles that I hold dear, such as political liberalism, the protection of human rights, and so on, âŠ
âŠ without approving of State intervention.
I, however, believe that State intervention is essential, first of all to make good any shortfalls and then to act in sectors in which, in any event, private capital would not be interested in getting involved.
This is the message that I wanted to leave with you; a somewhat provocative one perhaps, because I was led to believe that in the European Union, many people did not share my view of the free market.
I was given the opportunity to explain my point of view to you and thereby open the debate on an issue that is extremely important: that of the choice of strategy for the development of a country, and even of an entire continent.
Â Â  Mr President, you are not only a president but also a wise African.
Moreover, you have kept to the speaking time given by the European Parliament.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude and compliment you, Mr President, on your strong, clear and political message.
Â Â  I am very pleased to inform you that for the first time in a plenary sitting we have three new interpreting booths in operation.
We can therefore have interpretation facilities into three of the new languages for today's debates: Polish, Hungarian and Czech.
This does not alter the fact that full interpreting in all the new languages will only be available from 1 May 2004.
So with the limited facilities available, we intend to rotate the languages so that there is equal access for all the new languages.(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I have in front of me 26 candles.
I am aware that this could set off a fire alarm and would therefore be grateful if you would allow me to make this point in advance of the report by the President-in-Office of the Council.
I would like to ask the President-in-Office to comment on one issue which was not raised at the summit and which the Liberal Group feels should have been raised: the continued detention without trial of 26 European nationals at Guantanamo Bay.
These 26 candles are a symbol that these detainees should not be forgotten and, indeed, I hope that these 26 and all 600 detainees will have access to justice.
I would ask the Italian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, to raise this at every opportunity with the US Administration and to place it on the agenda for the next EU-US summit.
The President-in-Office complains that he is a victim of injustice before the law himself and so he should be particularly concerned about this very real injustice on a far greater scale.
Â Â  Exceptionally, I began with that point of order largely for safety reasons and to remove the possibility of a fire alarm.
Having made his point, I thank Mr Watson for extinguishing the candles.
Â Â  The first item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the European Council held in Brussels on 16 and 17 October 2003, including a progress report on the Intergovernmental Conference.
I should like to inform the House that during his last visit some months ago, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Berlusconi, made a number of commitments to the House on behalf of the Italian Presidency. Each of the commitments made to Parliament regarding our participation in the Intergovernmental Conference has been 100% delivered.
Our colleagues Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Mr HÃ€nsch both participate in the Foreign Affairs meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference and do so as full participants, with a level of involvement that is unprecedented for this House with regard to such work.
Second, I should point out that insofar as there may be a number of technical working groups on some aspects of the Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament will be fully associated with the work of any such group.
Third, for the first time ever, the President of the European Parliament has been invited by the presidency of the Council to attend and contribute to every summit meeting to be held on the Intergovernmental Conference, first in Rome on 4 October 2003, and again last week in Brussels.
This is an exceptional and unprecedented level of engagement. It meets a request this House made before the Italian Presidency started: the Convention set a new method, and a new partnership is required to build a Europe that has a constitution.
I want to place on the record on my behalf and on behalf of this House our gratitude to the presidency for delivering as promised.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for noting that the Presidency has delivered on the commitments which I, personally, made before the House relating to the participation of representatives of the European Parliament in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to report on the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference and the recent European Council.
At the opening of the Conference on 4 October 2003, the Heads of State or Government, together with the President of Parliament and the President of the European Commission, adopted the Declaration of Rome, which reaffirmed the essential role of European integration in securing peace, democracy, prosperity and solidarity in our continent.
I want to emphasise that we have pursued our efforts in close cooperation with the European Parliament, as you mentioned, Mr President.
The participation of President Cox in the meetings in Rome and Brussels and the participation of Mr HÃ€nsch and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo underscore the historic importance of the constitutional step we are in the process of taking.
The meetings of the Conference that have been held to date have confirmed that there is broad consensus on most of the provisions drafted by the Convention.
Differences remain regarding the specific reservations of some Member States.
We feel that it is essential to assess the draft document produced by the Convention as a whole, with the aim of strengthening each institution while preserving the balance that has been achieved between them.
The coming weeks will tell us whether it will be possible to achieve an agreement during the Italian Presidency.
Moreover, the Italian Presidency reiterates its refusal to support a watered-down compromise.
The proposal that we intend to submit in the second half of November, with a view to the final stages of negotiations, will offer worthy, noble solutions for a European Union capable of playing a leading role in bringing security, freedom and peace to the world.
In this connection, let me recall the progress that has been made in the field of common foreign and security policy, one of the pillars of the future Constitutional Treaty.
The debate between the Heads of State or Government of 16 October confirmed that there is consensus on the issue, which, I would say, is increasing.
In particular, the common foreign and security policy will be all the more effective and credible if it is part of a framework that is fully compatible with and complementary to the transatlantic relationship.
This aspect must be unambiguously reaffirmed in the future Constitutional Treaty.
Turning to last week's European Council, the proceedings were devoted to the issues of economic growth, boosting competitiveness and immigration policy.
The discussion revealed the shared desire for full coherence with the Lisbon Strategy.
In particular, I would like to stress the agreement in principle on the European Initiative for Growth: an initiative that the Italian Presidency launched at the start of the six-month term and which the Commission has fully endorsed and made its own.
The Initiative seeks to create transport infrastructure and energy and telecommunications networks, with a parallel effort to increase investment in innovation and research.
The implementation of these projects, as regards both infrastructure and innovation and research, will have to be financed by an appropriate mix of public and private funds, which will have a key role to play here.
The Commission has committed itself to the swift definition and launch of a package of projects for rapid implementation, with the possibility of a higher rate of cofinancing from the European Union budget.
The conclusions of the European Council also underscore the importance of an undertaking by the Union and the individual Member States to enhance the competitiveness of the European production sector across the board.
This emphasis is manifested in the call for rapid final approval of the Community patent regulation, the appeal to the Member States to step up the pace of transposal of Community internal market legislation into national law, and, above all, the call for rapid progress on the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan and for rapid conclusion of the work on the take-over bids directive.
In addition, we reiterated the objective of investing 3% of GDP in research and innovation.
The Council also reaffirmed the importance of the quality of legislation and, above all, the importance of simplification, deregulation and the efficiency and transparency of public administrations.
Lastly, we confirmed the importance of the social dimension of European economic development.
As regards employment, we await the report of the task force headed by Wim Kok, which will be discussed at an extraordinary Social Summit that the Presidency plans to convene on the eve of the December European Council.
We addressed a number of aspects of social protection with a view to making open coordination of Member Statesâ policies in this field more effective.
The aim is to promote and facilitate the modernisation of social protection systems in order to cope with the gradual ageing of the European population and to ensure the financial sustainability of pensionsystems.
We felt obliged to take note of this problem collectively without, however, interfering in the decision-making independence of the individual Member States.
Our purpose is to compare respective practices and to set common objectives to ensure the success of the intergenerational pact that underpins social cohesion within our societies.
The European Council also addressed certain aspects of the programmeof workestablished at Tampere, Laeken, Seville and, lastly, Thessaloniki, regarding asylum and immigration.
We reaffirmed our commitment to the balanced approach we have adopted thus far to the need to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings and strengthen external border control, and also to develop common policies for the reception and integration of legal immigrants to Europe.
At Thessaloniki, we set out the programme of work.
At Brussels, we gave further impulse to certain specific issues.
In the area of external border control, we noted the importance of the various joint initiatives that have been developed in recent months, which deserve better coordination.
For this reason, we welcomed the Commission's proposal to create a Border Management Agencyto enhance the various forms of operational cooperation between the Member States for the management of external borders.
As regards controlling migratory flows, we reaffirmed the importance of an effective common policy for readmission and return.
We thus urged the Commission to pursue the conclusion of readmission agreements with third countries, and we welcomed the Commission's proposal to provide adequate financial support for border management and return activities.
I believe President Prodi is going to update the House on the decisions taken in this regard.
Lastly, we felt it necessary to confirm, once again, the importance of forging constructive partnerships with third countries, both countries of origin and transit countries, to ensure the effective management of migratory flows.
While reaffirming full respect for national prerogatives in the sensitive area of deciding the number of legal immigrants to be admitted to their territories, we welcomed the Commission's initiation of a study on the relationship between legal and illegal immigration.
I would like to pause here to recall the recent tragedy and the horror, the sorrow we felt, and also the other tragic incidents which continue to take place in the Mediterranean, just off the Italian coast, which affect us even more deeply.
The loss of so many lives, of people driven by the force of desperation to seek a better future, must genuinely spur us to strengthen our mutual cooperation and prevent such disasters from ever happening again.
I would also like to stress here that our Christian principles tell us that we must genuinely seek to give these immigrants a reception which is worthy of our level of civilisation, these people who leave their countries where poverty reigns and come to Europe trusting solely in their will to work and in the strength of their arms.
I believe that we must all reflect carefully on the need for civilised Europe, Christian Europe, the Europe of prosperity, to open its doors and welcome those who come here hoping sincerely to be able to build a better future for themselves and their children.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council also considered a number of international developments that, given their urgency and importance, required the European Union to adopt a position.
With regard to the situation in the Middle East, the Council confirmed its commitment to the position the Union has always consistently held: on the one hand, its unwavering, unconditional condemnation of terrorism and its firm demand that the Palestinian Authority display genuine, practical determination to combat extremist violence; and, on the other, its demand that the Israeli Government change its settlement policy and, in exercising its legitimate right to defend its citizens, avoid actions which might cause civilian casualties.
Thus, Europe reiterates its determination to contribute to the implementation of all aspects of the roadmap, stressing the importance of an effective international monitoring mechanism.
We also confirmed the urgent need for an economic plan to revive the region's economy â which we named after the plan which brought about Europeâs recovery after the Second World War, the Marshall Plan â with the support of the G8 countries and the Member States of the European Union.
On Iraq, the Council welcomed the unanimous approval of UN Security Council Resolution 1511.
This resolution improves the outlook for the Donors Conference, which is, as you know, to be held in Madrid on 24 October 2003.
The European Union will make an initial pledge of EUR 200 million, already appropriated in the Community budget for 2003-2004.
In this regard, the High Representative for CFSP and the Commission were asked to develop a medium-term strategy for the European Unionâs relations with Iraq and to present a progress report by March 2004.
As regards Iran, we confirmed our attention to the deadline of the end of October established by the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the country to implement specific guarantees with regard to its nuclear programme.
The Iranian Government was again called on to sign, ratify and implement promptly and unconditionally the Additional Protocol on Safeguards and to suspend all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities.
At the same time, the European Union reiterated its willingness to develop wider cooperation with Iran.
The Italian Presidency maintained constant contact with France, Germany and the United Kingdom with regard to the mission of their Foreign Ministers to Teheran yesterday, 21 October.
The Presidency has closely followed the developments of the initiative since its conception in July 2003, considering it part of the broad action of the European Union as regards Iran.
We therefore welcome the positive outcome of that mission.
This development â if confirmed â will help create the conditions agreed on by the Brussels European Council which are necessary to foster cooperation with an important partner for the stability of the region.
The Council also addressed other developments in world affairs.
On Kosovo, firstly, the Council urged all of the parties involved in the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina to engage constructively in this process.
As regards the Republic of Moldova, we called for the resolution of the Transdniestrian issue and reiterated our support for the OSCE's mediation efforts.
The European Union remains attentive to developments in areas that are more distant geographically but are nevertheless linked to us by historical and cultural bonds.
We refer to the tragic developments in the situation in Bolivia and the turbulent preparations for elections in Guatemala, and express our concern at the violence and intimidation that is dominating the pre-electoral period there.
Lastly, I would like to note the warm congratulations extended by the European Council to His Holiness John Paul II on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of a pontificate devoted to building peace and solidarity among peoples.
The President-in-Office of the European Council has been charged by the Council to express, on its behalf, its support for and thanks to the Pope, not least in view of the important role played by his efforts to uphold civil rights, which the Council believes directly contributed to the collapse of the regime in the Soviet Union and certainly contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall.
This, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is the summary report of our work.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, when I last spoke to you, I pointed out that, although the underlying fundamentals are in place, quick, decisive action is needed to pull the Unionâs economy out of the current period of stagnation.
That is why the Commission presented the European Initiative for Growth I outlined to you at the beginning of the month.
Today, I am pleased to say that the European Council has endorsed our ideas for reviving the economy and stimulating growth and jobs.
The Growth Initiative is simple and practical.
It does not seek to alter the priorities of the Lisbon strategy, but to bolster and speed up its implementation.
Its main aims will be, firstly, to overcome the barriers to coordination, especially those deriving from red tape, and, secondly, to mobilise the public and private-sector funds needed to finance certain infrastructure projects already on the drawing board and get them started.
That is why we are preparing a quick-start list of infrastructure and research projects that are on a genuinely European scale.
The projects selected for the quick-start list will be taken from the longer list of 29 projects put forward earlier this year.
They will include major trans-European transport links and other projects with a high-technology content.
The list is based on two main ideas: a desire to produce practical results quickly and the great need to ensure compatibility with the sustainable-development goals we have set ourselves.
This desire to produce tangible results takes three main forms.
Firstly, it takes advantage of the potential offered by a higher rate of Union cofinancing.
Indeed, the Commission has proposed raising the Communityâs contribution to 30% of the cost of the cross-border component of each project.
This brings greater leverage in mobilising private-sector and other public-sector funding.
Secondly, it concentrates resources on a small number of mature projects.
The impact of investments will be all the greater if financial efforts are focused on those projects that are ready for take-off instead of being dispersed.
Thirdly, it selects projects with the highest potential toproduce results quickly.
This means practically resolving the most complex difficulties, particularly with a view to enlargement, creating jobs, stimulating growth and harnessing research and technological innovation potential, laying the foundations for improvements to competitiveness.
Lastly, the quick-start list gives great consideration to compatibility, and the projects selected are sustainable in environmental as well as in economic and financial terms.
In particular, however, the funding must comply with the Stability and Growth Pact and it must be in line with the commitment to improve the quality of expenditure, as set out in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines.
May I express my appreciation, at this point, for the great spirit of cooperation displayed by the European Investment Bank, which has drawn up a meticulous plan for financing this Initiative and with which we are working in complete harmony.
Of course, these are not the only projects that can be implemented under the Growth Initiative.
Personally, I hope others will be added to the list.
There are several other important aspects to this Initiative.
Firstly, it defines the priorities better and more clearly and concentrates resources on the best projects; it coordinates management of operative phases of major projects better, where appropriate appointing a coordinator to help resolve difficulties holding up the completion of work; it takes the regulatory environment into account and it tackles other bureaucratic and administrative factors that have slowed up completion thus far.
Where do we go from here?
The European Council has endorsed the ideas in the Initiative.
Indeed, it has given the Commission the green light to prepare a detailed proposal, in conjunction with the European Investment Bank, to put to the Heads of State or Government for approval in December.
The European Council's endorsement is very good news: programmes, action plans and consensus are all very well but they will not just produce investment at the drop of a hat.
To change things on the ground, we will need political will and a major undertaking.
The next few months will therefore be an important test for the European Union in this area.
In other words, if we are serious about meeting the Lisbon targets, we must hope that, in December, the European Council turns words into action and implements our proposals.
Ladies and gentlemen, the second topic I wish to report on is the Intergovernmental Conference.
As you know, the plan is for the draft Constitution to be approved at the Brussels European Council in December.
This will allow a new Treaty of Rome to be signed some time afterwards, at any rate before the European Parliament elections.
If the new Constitution is to be approved in December, it is vital for the Presidency to come forward by mid-November with clear proposals that can meet with consensus.
I would stress, here, that the Convention produced a balanced package of proposals containing some important innovations.
Overall, we continue to regard that package as a good basis for discussion.
Of course, the Intergovernmental Conference has to go into the points that were not addressed by the Convention or not dealt with in sufficient depth.
However, there are only a very few points where the draft Constitution needs changing and the ministers' meetings of 4 and 13 October showed that many of these points concern issues that the Constitution need not settle. It is more appropriate for them to be dealt with in secondary legislation or in the internal rules of the various institutions.
This would appear to be very important if we are to achieve effective conclusions quickly.
Today, I just want to focus on one point that, without a doubt, does need addressing at the Conference because it is likely to become a sticking point.
As you know, throughout the last Intergovernmental Conference, I fought for double simple majority voting in Council decision-making.
Indeed, our fellow citizens would intuitively understand such a system because it would be simple and transparent. It would also make for more effective, streamlined decision-making.
I have never concealed the fact that, on this point, I was disappointed with the outcome at Nice and I have done my best to promote a simple system: a simple majority of at least 50% of the Member States and of 50% plus one of the population.
The draft Constitution put forward by the Convention provided for a slightly more complicated system: 50% of the Member States and 60% of the population.
That is not quite what we had hoped for but, overall, I feel it is still a satisfactory solution, for it is simple and transparent and means decisions can be taken.
In practical terms, under this system, decisions have practically the same chances of being adopted successfully as under the extremely complex weighting system concocted at Nice.
There are some, however, who would now like to raise the figure for a qualified majority to 66% of the population.
We must strongly oppose this idea, which seeks to overturn the balance crafted by the Convention.
Looking at the possible consequences, it would make it so much easier for a small minority to block an initiative and hamstring the Union.
In the way it is made up, as we have already said, the Commission must reflect all national perspectives.
Moreover, even the Convention came out in favour of a Commission comprising one Commissioner from each Member State.
Little consideration has been given to this, but the Conventionâs proposal isone Commissioner per Member State.
However, the structure proposed was complicated and, in my opinion, unworkable.
Our proposal must not, therefore, be seen as reopening the constitutional package â there is already one Commissioner per Member State â but, in actual fact, as a contribution to a final compromise.
The proof is that a majority of countries are clearly in favour of a Commission with Commissioners coming from each Member State of the Union and all enjoying the same voting rights.
That is the difference.
This could bring us closer to a balanced, politically acceptable solution.
The Commission has already put forward suggestions for organising an enlarged Commission that would ensure it is effective in decision-making terms as well as having full legitimacy.
Anyone who imagines the Commission is seeking to introduce a here or that we could stray so far from the vision of the founding fathers is, therefore, way off track.
The Commission can play its political role only if it can assert a legitimacy and credibility of its own, and these derive from its close link with national cultures and perspectives across the whole Union.
Lastly, there is a third point which it is absolutely vital to address: ensuring that the Constitution can be amended in the future.
We are aware that, if changes have to be agreed and ratified unanimously by 25 or more different parties, this will mean, in practice, that the Constitution cannot be amended.
Any reform will be completely impossible.
Remember â and, here, since everyone else is doing so, I really do want to recall the great battle that took place over the wording of the US ConstitutionÂ âÂ that, if it cannot be amended, our Constitution will not be workable and will fall apart at the very first hitch.
An inflexible Constitution is worse than nothing.
Ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen from these brief words, the European Union needs a dynamic economy and a sound Constitution.
We must muster the strength of the large Member States and rally the support of the smaller for the good of all.
We must release all our existing energies and harness our resources to the full.
When we speak of harnessing our resources to the full, I am also thinking of the resources we draw from legal immigration â which the President-in-Office of the Council rightly mentioned â the immigrants that form the bulk of the workforce for those jobs that our young people no longer want to do â there is no point in pretending this is not the case â and the highly qualified technicians we vitally need for our industry and our economy.
The whole phenomenon of migration is very difficult to manage, both in terms of the need to integrate legal immigrants, who must share in the rights that our society guarantees to all its citizens, and in terms of combating illegal immigration and the latter-day trade in human beings that violates all our values so intolerably.
This is not a burden that we can leave the individual Member States to bear, not least because it would be heavier for some Member States than others.
Today, no one can cope with it satisfactorily, given the lack of a single EU policy approach to the phenomenon.
The Commission has done its part and perhaps even more than its duty, for many of our proposals have not been accepted.
There was the Tampere programme and the Thessaloniki programme too.
Now we have undertaken to adopt a proposal very quickly on an agency for the common management of borders.
That is a lot, and I am happy to acknowledge it, but it is not enough.
It is clear from what Mr Berlusconi said that the problem continues to have very tragic consequences and that it may even be growing.
A single policy approach is needed and funding will have to be found to implement it.
Common channels must be defined for legal immigration and a global negotiation organised on that basis with the countries of emigration, the countries of provenance of immigrants.
Moreover â to show you the full extent of the problems â these countries need to have such legal lists so they can step up measures to discourage these desperate attempts by illegal immigrants.
We must guarantee to these countries that at least a minimal amount of their emigration can be regularised; in other words, there must be cooperation between us.
It was not possible to achieve this at the last Council, but the Commission will strike out once again along this road because we see it as the only way of actively managing immigration, both legal and illegal.
I cannot close my eyes to these recurring tragedies that have been mentioned.
We cannot close our eyes to them, and the Commission certainly will not.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Intergovernmental Conference was at the heart of the Brussels Summit, and our group welcomes the Italian Presidencyâs determination and goodwill in intending to come up with a result in time for the Summit on 12/13 December.
We wish to encourage you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in your endeavours to bring this about, for, if the Intergovernmental Conference drags itself out into 2004, there is an even greater risk of further chapters being opened, with the result that we will not come to a conclusion.
We therefore urge you to do everything to enable a result to be achieved under your presidency.
We are alongside you in doing so.
As regards the institutional issues, we urge that any solution to the problem of the Commissionâs composition should be satisfactory to both the large and small countries.
We warn against the mere acknowledgement that the larger countries have claims, for the smaller ones, too, are entitled to appropriate representation, and this is an issue I wish you much success in resolving.
If you manage to do so, then it will also be possible to resolve the issue of the European Councilâs Presidency and of its composition.
As regards the voting in the Council of Ministers, the overwhelming majority in our group is not of one mind; there are one or two exceptions, but the overwhelming majority favours the dual-majority principle as proposed by the Convention.
We take the view that the Convent has put before us a proposal that is in line with the Community method, and one that we should allow to succeed.
Turning to the Legislative Council, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we insist that transparency and continuity be introduced into the legislative work of the European Council of Ministers.
This is an area in which we must not revert to old-style secret diplomacy, with it not being known what goes on behind the doors of the Council of Ministers.
One problem that we must resolve is the Maastricht issue, that of price stability.
Although price stability is a constituent element in the Constitution, nowhere do we see the 3% deficit limit being kept to, and general requirement to maintain price stability is of little use if it lacks an explicit basis.
We therefore ask that it be ensured that clear and quantifiable bases, with reference to protocols, are in place in order that price stability should not exist merely in theory, but may, in practical terms too, remain a central element in our common policy.
If I may comment on the external borders, it is with great joy that I have heard that Mr Berlusconi, the President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, have come to an agreement on immigration matters.
We in the European Union do, of course, need our external borders to be protected, but our concern is that protection of the external borders resolves only part of the problem, which is a profoundly human one.
The sight of wretched, hungry, thirsty people, including children â such as we have seen on the shores of the island of Lampedusa â shows that this is not just about the protection of our external borders, but about these pitiable people being given a chance in their own countries and not needing to get in their boats.
That is why it is important that border controls should be carried out within the countries from which these people emigrate and that developments in them should be brought to completion so as to make it possible for young people to look forward to a proper, good, and decent future in their own homeland.
To that end, we, the European Union, have our own contribution to make in the Mediterranean region.
The word âGuantanamoâ featured in my notes â with which I can now dispense â even before we heard of MrÂ Watsonâs symbolic and expressive action in the Chamber.
We take the view that major problems are adequately addressed by the use of persuasion.
Our concern is not only with the twenty-six Europeans, but also with all those who are detained in Guantanamo.
Whilst we are all in favour of combating terrorism, our Christian conception of man teaches us that every human being, even the worst of criminals, has the right to be tried in accordance with the law.
We therefore appeal to our American friends to abide by the principles of human rights.
Consider, if you will, that these 600 detainees include five or six who have done nothing.
What harm is being done to these people, and how unjustly they are being treated!
That is the actual crux of our European attitude to the death penalty.
Even if only one person is wrongly executed, that is sufficient reason to deny the death penalty any justification whatever.
What I say to the Americans I say as one who thinks of himself as one of their friends, urging them to understand our position, which is founded on the rule of law and on human dignity, that every human being is of equal worth, whatever the colour of their skin, their gender, or their nationality.
Let me turn, for my final comments, to the subject of European defence.
I speak as one who had the pleasure of serving for ten years as chairman of Parliamentâs security and disarmament subcommittee, when we always supported Europeâs strong defence capacity as a member of the North Atlantic Alliance.
We want the North Atlantic Alliance to be founded on the twin pillars of Europe and the USA, and we would ask our American friends to understand why we are reinforcing Europeâs defences.
Far from this being in opposition to the US, we seek to complement each other, and want to be strong together. At the heart of this is our joining in defending our common values.
It is on that foundation that any common European defence policy must rest.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Presidentâin-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the Presidentâin-Office of the Council on the Brussels Summit offers us â to put it in artistic terms â a sketch, an outline in chiaroscuro, because a very important challenge for the whole of Europe is being faced, which is to draw up the Constitution and also to organise our territory.
It makes good sense, therefore, at the same time as the Constitution, to talk about the networks of arteries and nerves â the infrastructure networks â which give structure to something which is more than just a market: a project aimed at sharing our lives.
With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, I must express my groupâs concern, because it gives the impression that it is producing a litany, a repetition of positions, and is not getting down to solving problems.
I must say that we are very concerned about the fact that the first decision to be made â with the opposition of the representatives of Parliament â has been to remove the Legislative Council.
This is very important, because we are in a Parliament and, having achieved shared legislative power for the first time, the Conferenceâs first decision has been to eliminate the possibility of legislating jointly with us.
I would therefore ask that this mistaken decision be reconsidered.
With regard to the voting system, we have three problems which must be resolved jointly: the composition of the Commission, the Presidency of the Council and the voting system.
In this regard, I must say that, for our part, on the basis that our thinking involves how to make decisions together â and not how to block them â we support the system of double majority, as proposed by the Convention.
I would draw attention to an aspect which is important to Parliament: do not use Parliamentary seats as jokers for concluding your negotiations.
This is a much more serious issue.
With regard to the draft Constitution, I would also like to point out that the economic issue demonstrates the insufficiency of an important matter: the regulation of economic governance.
This is a very important problem in terms of price stability and also in terms of how we take coherent decisions, not only on monetary policy but also on economic policy.
Finally, the issue of revising the Constitution is essential since a Constitution cannot be closed completely.
That would make it completely useless.
With regard to GuantÃ¡namo â on which we held a hearing with other political groups in Parliament in order to debate the issue â I must say that at the moment we have European citizenship in the Constitution.
However, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, it is the governments of the Member States which have to defend the European citizens.
I would ask you to urge the governments to take on their responsibilities.
With regard to the economy, what you have done has been basically to rescue the Delors Plan â ten years later â to overcome the Ecofin Council's veto â which has been blocking this plan â and now you are proposing a series of actions which would really make sense, including the launch of a European loan, because here there is talk of how well the European Investment Bank can do it, but we will have to see whether private capital â of which there is plenty â is offered.
This is an important issue which has not been clarified.
I must say, Mr Presidentâin-Office of the Council, that with the cardinalâs language you have used, what you are proposing are recommendations to the national governments.
It is not the European Parliament which is holding up the European patent.
We are not holding up the transposition of regulations: it is the ministers and their governments who have to obey you.
It is not for you to give advice, but to order your own governments to implement the policies you decide on.
This is truly notable because it is a kind of litany which is repeated systematically.
With regard to employment, we eagerly await the Koch report and it makes sense to talk about the issue which was launched under the Swedish Presidency of the European demographic autumn in relation to pensions and immigration.
On immigration and the decisions of the European Council in Thessaloniki, I would like to say to you, Mr President, given that Europe is secular and that European values are not the monopoly of any single religion â for the first time in history, fortunately â that we share in the regrets and condolences over what is happening.
I must also say that in your government there are people who are doing positive work â and we are quite happy to recognise it: Mr Pisanu is demonstrating serious political responsibility in the face of absolutely intolerable and xenophobic attitudes on the part of other members of your government.
Mr Pisanu is taking the same approach as another Italian Interior Minister â Mr Napolitano â who was the person who initiated the policy of agreements with countries from which immigrants originate, a policy which should be developed, and I do not believe it is sufficient to talk about the Borders Agency, we should talk about co-development and quotas, and you must reach an agreement on this.
This is the approach which really makes sense for the future.
Finally, Mr President, as well as our groupâs belief in the importance of the step forward in terms of European defence, in relation to external relations I would like to say that my group welcomes and supports the decision of this Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to award the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan, to the United Nations staff who have died and also in memory of Sergio Vieira de Mello.
I understand, Mr President, from what I heard in the United Nations last week, that Mr Kofi Annan has agreed to come here in January.
I believe we should support that decision.
Finally, turning to the so-called Conference of Donors in Madrid, our group fully supports the proposal approved by the European Council to contribute EUR 200 million.
The only thing we wish to point out is that the US Senate, when President Bush asked them for aid, divided the aid: half in loans and half in donations.
In other words, we do not need to go further than the United States which, in principle, has taken a step forward by returning to the United Nations, but in a situation in which it is increasingly necessary to have a timetable for returning sovereignty to the Iraqi people.
Â Â  I should like to take this opportunity to inform the House that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, will address our plenary session in Brussels on 29 January 2004.
We very much look forward to that.
Â Â  Mr President, the Liberal Group in this House welcomes the Italian Presidency's initiative to associate the President of this House more closely with the work of the European Council.
Nonetheless the overwhelming feeling of the European Liberal Democrats is one of disappointment at the outcome of the European Council.
We fear that it may be recalled, if at all, as a summit distinguished more by what it failed to discuss and agree than for what it actually achieved.
One issue that was not raised is the continued detention, without charge or trial, of 26 European nationals at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba of whom I spoke earlier.
As a symbol for them, I have in front of me 26 candles.
I am sorry that the President-in- Office did not respond to my invitation to say a few words this morning about the continued detention of those European nationals and, indeed, of all 600 detainees.
It seems to my Group that their detention without charge is a scandal and that the failure of European Union leaders in the Council presidency to keep the matter on their radar screen must be remedied.
This House is no less concerned by the situation in Chechnya.
The wrongs which are being committed daily, in the name of the fight against terrorism, will hasten the rainfall of revenge which refills the tributaries of terror.
With less than two months to go until the end-of-the-year summit, by which time we are supposed to reach agreement on a new Constitution, the presidency had no time to lose.
We fear that an opportunity for progress may have been missed.
But handed an agenda with little real substance, EU leaders gave back even less.
I question whether it was wise for the Italian Presidency not to push for decisions on the Constitution or to make compromise proposals now rather than leaving things to November.
That may be too late â politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum.
The lack of proposals has encouraged some countries to retreat from the Convention's agreement, and Poland and Spain to get a hearing for their self-interested sentimentality for the discarded agreements of Nice.
The crucial common defence clauses were discussed 'over dinner' but apart from Mr Blair's welcome U-turn on structured cooperation, we appear to have achieved little apart from giving America indigestion.
Nor was there substantive progress on economic reform.
While we welcome the European growth initiative and the refocusing away from spending on white elephant transport projects towards investment in R[amp]D, the real focus to get back to growth must be progress on structural reform.
We would have liked to see the Council putting its legislative money where its mouth is and building the dynamic, open economy we were promised at Lisbon.
Progress on Justice and Home Affairs was limited, with little forward movement on the important issues of immigration and asylum.
The one positive development, the creation of a European agency to manage the security of our expanding borders, was again agreed beforehand and merely rubber-stamped.
The flip side of the coin is the proposal for biometric indicators for passports and visas which should have set civil liberty alarm bells ringing loudly but which seemed not to trouble the summit at all.
President-in-Office, much rests on your November compromise text for the Constitution.
It will be your last throw of the dice and we wish you luck since we fear you may need it!
Â Â  I should like to remind the House that last week the Conference of Presidents invited the Council and the Commission to make statements this afternoon on the issue of Chechnya.
I understand that will indeed take place during the afternoon.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sure we all remember the heartfelt cry MrÂ GiscardÂ d'Estaing gave here on 3Â September: âNever forget the citizens!â
Our Heads of State or Government have clearly failed to take this piece of friendly advice.
The impression that they give of their exchanges on the draft constitution is rather pathetic and takes us back in time: this is Nice all over again. The problem is not that the issues they addressed are not worthy ones.
They are, however, entirely cut off from what most citizens consider to be the crucial issues: what are the ambitions for the future Union? How will societyâs expectations be met?
How much will is there to change the course of the current trend of globalisation? Consequently, the discussions taking place unfortunately resemble a power struggle, lacking any vision capable of capturing the peopleâs imagination.
I believe that the European idea is frankly worth more than that.
Some observations made by the President of the Commission in his letter to the President-in-Office of the Council also appear to be incapable of stimulating any kind of excitement about Europe amongst the general public.
His remarks suggest that European citizens increasingly feel it is important for the Union to press ahead with the structural reforms decided on at Lisbon.
These are the proposed reforms on retirement pensions, on social protection, on the labour market, on public services, and yet it is precisely this type of measure that is increasingly frequently setting workers, pensioners and the unemployed, from Rome to Paris, via Berlin, against this caricature of harmonising European policy.
What, furthermore, are we supposed to think about the aim stated in the same letter and I quote, âto speed up the adoption, at European level, of measures that will enable us to exploit the potential of legal immigrants, while maintaining a firm stance in the fight against illegal immigrationâ.
Does this two-pronged approach really express the concept of Europe-South relations that we wish to promote in the eyes of our fellow citizens?
It will definitely grate on the young people who have embraced the idea that another world is possible, a world without predators and without fortresses. These young people feel that a genuine and proactive development policy that gives new hope to the peoples of the South must underpin the solution to the problem of people immigrating in order to survive.
More generally, however, is it not time to show the entire European public that the essentially utilitarian and security-based approach to immigration is a dead end, as demonstrated by the unbearable and endlessly repeated tragedies such as the recent example that occurred in the waters surrounding the island of Lampedusa?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, lastly, and in conclusion, I wish on behalf of my group to put forward a practical, constructive and achievable proposal, which would enable you to make one of those gestures that honour the Union in the eyes of our fellow citizens, because they really bring to life the values that we claim imbue our texts.
This proposal concerns peace in the Middle East.
As you know, extremely courageous men and women, both Palestinian and Israeli, have spent two years working on a new peace plan, without sidestepping any of the problems that have impeded all official negotiations to date.
Some of these people are eminently representative individuals from the fields of politics, the military and culture, including the former Speaker of the Knesset, AvramÂ Burg, with whom we are all familiar.
This plan has just been made public and this afternoon, two of its creators, NaomiÂ Shazan, former deputy Speaker of the Knesset and MrÂ Jamal Zakoud from the Palestinian Legislative Council will join us.
At 4Â p.m., they will present their historic initiative to all Members who wish to hear.
Beforehand, PresidentÂ Cox will receive them and I wish to thank him for doing so.
I propose, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, that you also receive these individuals and that you honour with your presence, or that at least the Council and the Commission honour with their presence, the formal signing of this peace plan in Geneva on 4Â November, the anniversary of Yitzhak Rabinâs assassination.
This would be a gesture for peace and what gesture could better stamp Europeâs identity on the world stage?
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, it may be true that six months is too short a time to make any real headway on matters but it is an even shorter time if one has the tendency to waste time holding meetings of Heads of State which serve no purpose, being merely expensive repetitions of debates already held at Foreign Minister level.
The Italian Presidency should have presented some conclusive documents at Brussels to attempt to resolve issues which have been staring us in the face for months.
There have been enough questionnaires: now it is time to provide some answers.
In this connection, I would like briefly to mention the Legislative Council.
We believe that this is a genuine question of democracy.
As Mr Frattini said yesterday, there is a discrepancy between what many governments are imposing and what the overwhelming majority of parliaments wants.
The Legislative Council is essential to ensure democratic control and the separation of powers, and, today, we would like your government to provide guarantees on this matter.
The Intergovernmental Conference, with its gridlock, the debates of pernickety haggling over figures and percentages which are so reminiscent of the nights of Nice, leaves us somewhat nostalgic for the Convention, which, with all its shortcomings, successfully debated the common future of the Europeans and how to govern them.
A word about the Lampedusa tragedy: these are not immigrants, they are refugees, and there are proposals gathering dust in the Council on the legal framework for immigration and the definition of refugee while the different governments continue to exchange proposals.
Mr President-in-Office, find a solution to the matter.
That will be worth much more than many words.
The spirit of Nice is also hovering over the lengthy list of bridges and motorways which the Italian Presidency and Commissioner de Palacio wish to give us.
With regard to the famous list of trans-European transport networks, all we hear today are the cries of the two categories of interested parties: those lamenting the inclusion of a particular tunnel or corridor and those who are champing at the bit and want to start building as soon as possible.
There is no discussion of the quality of these investments or whether they are necessary; everyone is treating the issue as though it were a matter of national prestige.
Proof of this is the Italian Governmentâs barely disguised attempt to put increasingly unceremonious pressure on France, which is rightly unsure as to the need for the Turin-Lyon tunnel.
It is genuinely embarrassing, Mr President-in-Office, for a large country such as Italy to have to bargain for an unsustainable tunnel with a dubious electricity investment, especially if we consider the truly non-European nature of Mr Lunardiâs conflict of interests with regard to this project.
We continue, undeterred, to say that what would help to genuinely boost environmentally and socially sustainable growth in Europe now is a kind of Marshall Plan â a different sort of Marshall plan, promoting useful infrastructure but also renewable energies, land regeneration, research and innovation.
Every day, kilometres upon kilometres of railway branch lines are closed in the countries soon to join the Union, leaving thousands of citizens with no transport: this is further evidence of the fact that the mobility problems are not going to be solved by the airy-fairy promise of trans-European networks.
We call upon the Commission not to continue merely to rubber stamp demands from various quarters but to return to its key task: pursuing the interests of Union.
It would appear that there is going to be a new list, known as the quick-start list.
Without further ado, we would say to President Prodi that we greatly welcome the idea, particularly if this new list is based on the quality of the work and its social and environmental sustainability, unlike the Van Miert list organised by Commissioner de Palacio.
We must rememberÂ âÂ since the Commission and the Council appear to have forgottenÂ âÂ that Parliament has power of codecision on this matter and we intend to make full use of it.
Mr President, we see the decision taken by the Council to transfer analysis of the chemicals legislation to the Competitiveness Council as a defeat for all those who care about citizensâ health and as a victory for the great chemical industry.
Clearly, the decision was affected by the reluctance and delays on the part of the Commission in presenting its proposal and by the excessive consideration it gave to lobbies, as well as by its serious oversight in failing to incorporate the demands of civil society during an extremely long pretence at consultation.
It is to protect health and the environment, not to promote competitiveness or trade, that it was decided to draw up a proposal on this matter in 1998.
We will hold fast tothis line and we are ready to give battle, alongside the environmental and consumer associations, out of respect for all those workers who continue to fall ill and die in Europe and throughout the world.
Mr Watson started with an evocative reminder of the appalling situation in GuantÃ¡namo, but I would stress my disappointment at the fact that there has been no mention of the 11Â 000 prisoners, or detainees, we might say, being held by the United States in Baghdad: they are not Europeans but they, too, have rights.
We repeat our proposal once again here: we must suspend the entry into force of the extradition agreement with the United States in order to put pressure on the United States in this matter.
One last point, Mr President-in-Office: as you know, the European Parliament is extremely sensitive to the question of its citizensâ rights.
In July, Parliament called upon Italy to do something about the case of Adriano Sofri, turning it into a European issue.
We are confident that you will respond to that call: you have the capacity to do so.
As Europeans, we feel it is genuinely distressing to see the entire Italian Government, and the will of the President, too, so completely at the mercy of the whims of a minister.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Presidents, I wish to say first of all that I believe the criticism made of the outcome of the European Council and the Intergovernmental Conference is exaggerated, not to say inappropriate.
I must first say to the President of the Commission that, for once, I am satisfied with his proposals, and I am similarly satisfied with the proposals of the European Council concerning the initiative for growth.
This initiative is indeed crucial, as is linking private funds to public funds in order to ensure that our economy develops more effectively.
For that to happen, however, all of our countries must adopt a number of measures to encourage private investment and, in particular, we must ensure that the red tape of the European Commission and the consequences thereof do not add to the red tape that already exists in each of our countries.
Having said that, I believe that this is a step in the right direction.
Secondly, what upsets the previous speakers is something that I personally find reassuring.
By this I mean that some of our fellow Members are rather naÃ¯ve.
There is, as we know, a federalist majority here, which expressed its views when the work of the Convention was approved.
This approval was accompanied by a degree of pretentiousness, not to say considerable arrogance, in claiming that the Heads of State or Government, who are in fact the sole source of national legitimacy in each of our countries, would not have the right to table any proposals for amendments whatsoever.
By the same token, these federalist members were also extremely naÃ¯ve to think that the countries joining the European Union would be satisfied with a minor role for their âpretendâ Commissioners.
Do not be surprised then, at the results that you get.
I agree with Lenin, who said that facts are stubborn: you are facing the facts, so acknowledge them!
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Brussels Summit brought the common border police force that much closer.
Soon, we shall have common monitoring of the EUâs external borders, just as we had in the old days around our own country.
The EU state proceeds according to plan. So does the EU Constitution.
Work is now being done on the basis of the draft produced by the Convention.
There will, however, be a Commissioner from each country, because a number of countries cannot get the Constitution accepted without national Commissioners.
We also want the countries themselves to choose the Commissioners and for there to be complete equality between the countries in the chairing of Council of Ministers meetings.
There is now a danger of there being group presidencies, with three or four countries leading the EU for 18 to 24 months and, in practice, the possibility of the largest country in the group taking charge of the most important tasks.
It would be wiser to continue with the current rotation scheme in which countries can concentrate for six months on delivering a proper presidency.
To limit the burden of work, the individual Council formations and, in particular, the 297 working parties in the Council might be given the option of selecting their own chairman from among themselves on the basis of a combination of fair rotation and the chairmanâs personal qualifications for presiding over the meetings.
Allow me especially to warn against what are known as the passerelles â or one-way motorways â in which the prime ministers are themselves left to define the borders between the EU and the nation states and are able to extend the scope of EU cooperation by means of the flexibility clause in Article 17.
They are able to introduce the ordinary legislative procedure and move from unanimity to decisions by qualified majority through Article 24(4) and, for example, with reference to Article 39(8) in the case of foreign policy.
If the three methods are combined, almost all issues may fall within EU competence.
Instead, for example, of the Danish Prime Ministerâs desire for a catalogue of competences with a clear division of power between the EU and the Member States, we get unrestricted prime ministerial government and much more centralisation of legislative power in Brussels.
We must now hope that all the EU countries will hold referendums on the draft Constitution.
It is absurd that MrÂ Blair should have held referendums on regional parliaments in Scotland and Wales and on the municipal government in London but will not allow a referendum on Great Britainâs first written Constitution.
Take courage, MrÂ Blair, it is not enough to hold a referendum on a new constitution in Iraq.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Pasqua was right to say that this is the European Parliament he knows: this is the result of the anti-European positions of De Gaulle, not of the Europe which Winston Churchill called upon in 1946 in Zurich to stand up, talking about a âUnited States of Europeâ.
Here, we have the disunited states of Europe, we have bureaucracies that are destroying each other and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have a Council which was called upon by Parliament in July to appoint a European representative for the Caucasus and, on 4 September, and, again, on 24 September, to appoint a representative for Iraq.
We will not be giving anything to Chechnya, suffering from genocide, or to alleviate the situation in Iraq, apart from that shameful little bribe worthy of the dealers of southern Italy, apart from 200 million out of 35 billion.
Look at Europe, this Europe!
With regard to Israel, Iraq, Chechnya and, I am sure, GuantÃ¡namo, Europe roars at the United States and brays at Russia, China, Chechnya and Vietnam.
Clearly, then, I cannot say we are laying too much blame at the door of the Italian Presidency.
The draft Constitution, which has been laid before us with so much hype, is no more than a formless, empty, pretentious mass which has no basis in the constitutional law with which the world is familiar.
As regards the rule of law and the liberal states, it makes overambitious, presumptuous demands, and it cannot even stand the test now, in its initial stages; just imagine how effective it will be when the time comes to implement it.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, despite the calls from the European Parliament, you have not yet produced an informal draft on the death penalty and we are almost at the end of the UN General Assembly.
On this, we can wait: Israel can wait, Turkey can wait and we European federalists of the great pro-European tradition of Italy and many other parts of Europe can wait too.
Â Â  Mr President, with less passion than the previous speaker, but with at least as much conviction, I would like to say that I feel a sense of frustration over the way in which the Intergovernmental Conference is developing.
I feel this sense of frustration firstly because I believe that we have lost the spirit of the Convention, which consisted of seeking the best for the future of the Europe of 25, and my respected friend, Mr Pasqua, recalled Lenin when he said that facts are stubborn.
What is more, they really are, because those governments which have to approve the Constitution had a presence in the Convention and actively participated in it, and I believe that nobody should go against their own actions.
I feel frustration, Mr President, because I have the feeling that we are going to see over the coming days an attempt to reopen all the issues dealt with in the Convention.
The Italian Presidency has sent a proposal telling the governments what has to be dealt with in the Convention.
The response has been 150 pages of proposals to reopen almost all the issues that the Convention dealt with.
There is also something entirely paradoxical, which is that certain formations of the Council of Ministers â such as the Ecofin Council â are also making proposals to revise the Constitution.
The worst thing about these proposals, ladies and gentlemen, is that none of them are ambitious, none of them go further than the Constitutional text.
They are cheapskate proposals.
In reality, moreover, the Constitutional text could have been more ambitious.
I will give an example of what I mean: PartÂ IV, which refers to the revision of the constitutional text, was dealt with very little in the Convention, due to lack of time, and President GiscardÂ dâEstaing even promised that we would discuss it after Thessaloniki.
Well this has not happened.
Here we have enormous scope for making specific proposals.
There is no specific proposal in this regard, however.
I also feel frustrated because the spirit of the Convention is a spirit of compromise, but compromise by blocks.
But I notice that there are proposals, for example, which seek to reform the budgetary procedure.
But this cannot be dealt with separately.
It forms a package with the financial perspectives and with own resources.
And if we, as the European Parliament, accept the package, we cannot accept now that one part should be left as it is and that the agreement on the budgetary procedure should be broken.
I therefore believe that the Intergovernmental Conference must concentrate on genuinely political issues, which have not yet been resolved, on which there is no consensus between the governments and which are very simple: the presidency of the Council and the rotating presidencies, the weighting of votes and the distribution of seats in the European Parliament and the number of Commissioners.
Constructive proposals â and I would urge the Italian Presidency to make some â must be presented en bloc and must not be piecemeal.
I have therefore once again failed to understand today â and I say this because I am concerned â the speech by the President of the Commission when he says that the weighting of votes is very good, but that, on the other hand, the number of Commissioners must be changed.
We cannot accept the parts of proposals that we want and reject the rest.
We will have to seek a compromise solution and I hope that the Italian Presidency will do so and do so quickly.
Â Â  Mr President, I will just focus on the issues relating to the Intergovernmental Conference, although, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you were very restrained on this subject too, as, moreover, were the Councilâs conclusions of 16 October, which devoted a mere eight and a half lines to it.
Yesterday, however, Mr Frattini and I were able to discuss the matter in depth in the Committee on Constitutional Affairsâ meeting open to the national parliaments, and I want to mention concerns and critical points expressed at that meeting, which have been echoed just now by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo.
I would like to make one thing absolutely clear.
There is no prejudice towards the Italian Presidency whatsoever in Parliament.
Quite the opposite: we know we are indebted to Italy for the major contributions it has made to European integration at crucial times as a founder country.
The Italian Presidencyâs problem is now how to live up to this reputation, following on in the highest tradition of Italian Europeanism.
Why are we concerned?
Because a significant number of governments have shown a tendency to challenge some of the most important innovations of the draft Convention.
How should we respond to this tendency?
That is the question.
The way the Ministerial Meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference started alarmed us.
We know what happened, even though you have not mentioned it, Mr Berlusconi.
The debate started with the new development introduced by the Conventionâs draft regarding the operation of the Unionâs legislative process, which is no longer to be dispersed among the many different configurations of the Council of Ministers, but with legislative powers being concentrated in a single General and Legislative Affairs Council instead.
In the questionnaire-based consultation which took place before the debate between Foreign Affairs Ministers, a large number of the governments said ânoâ, although we do not know what their reasons were.
However, the representatives of all the governments which are now opposed to the idea had accepted this innovation as part of the final overall compromise of the Convention.
The issue of the Legislative Council is not insignificant.
I do not have the time to explain why now, but we are alarmed by what happened regarding the issue of the Legislative Council at the Ministerial Meeting of the IGC.
The issue cannot and must not be considered closed.
If it were to be considered closed, we would not be facing an unacceptable compromise but total surrender.
Moreover, just as, with their unequivocal refusals, many governments have put a stopper on the introduction of the Legislative Council, they could do the same thing on other, equally or even more important, key points of the draft Convention.
This way of doing things is unacceptable.
The Presidency must only take into consideration calls for amendments for which there is clear, long-term justification.
It is the Presidencyâs task to display the necessary ability for persuasion and drive, confident in the knowledge, Mr Berlusconi, that it represents not only Italyâs position but all the positions and groupings which contributed to the conclusion agreed upon by the Convention.
These groupings include the parliamentsÂ âÂ we must never forget that: the European Parliament and 28 national parliaments, in other words the direct representatives, legitimised by the vote of the citizens, the peoples of the Union.
