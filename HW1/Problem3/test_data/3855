Therefore the report adopted by Parliament last week on cleaner, greener energy was excellently timed: it will help us shape our final recommendations and confirms our own conviction that citizens will not thank the European Union for timidity in this matter.
The scale of the challenge demands a credible and ambitious response.
Finally, on external policy, we are starting to see the fruits of a new coherence and determination in that policy.
In various parts of the world and on a wide range of issues - Lebanon, Congo and the results achieved at long last with our Russian partners on the Siberian overflight issue - the past six months have seen the European Union showing the right mix of political, economic and aid policies.
The result has been a positive European contribution to global issues.
While we recognise that a lot more has to be done, it is fair to acknowledge that some progress has been achieved.
Last June we agreed our twin-track strategy of a Europe of results.
At the European Council meeting we recognised that this kind of policy is going in the right direction.
We made this a natural way to progress on the future of Europe and hopefully on the settlement of the constitutional question.
We have to say once again that the Europe of the future cannot be built with the tools of the past.
We cannot fulfil all our ambitions for Europe and concrete results for citizens with the tools and instruments of the past.
We need the democracy and efficiency offered by the Constitutional Treaty.
At the Summit, Chancellor Merkel made it clear that the time for general debate on the future of the Constitution is over and that she will be focusing on precise questions with Member States in order to determine the room for manoeuvre and the best time for making progress.
It is my impression that there is a gathering momentum and a degree of willingness among Member States to work constructively to find a way forward on the issue of institutional reform.
The report made by Prime Minister Vanhanen to the European Council was a very important contribution to the work that should now continue under the German Presidency.
The European Union is well placed to take a decisive step forward in 2007.
Let us show that we are up to the challenge.
I look forward to working closely with the incoming German Presidency and I should like to thank once again the Finnish Prime Minister, Mr Vanhanen, and all his team for their very serious, very committed and very energetic contribution to the progress of Europe.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating the President-in-Office of the Council on his Presidency on behalf of our group.
Not only has his been a successful Presidency, but also - and maybe it takes a country such as Finland to achieve this - the goodwill he has shown at the helm of the EU has done us a power of good.
We should like to see all the subsequent Presidencies showing this kind of goodwill.
I should like to congratulate him on his commitment to our common cause - Europe.
Several successes have been achieved during his Council Presidency.
We have just seen the signing of REACH, and the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Services Directive have been adopted, although we know that previous Presidencies and Parliament have also worked on the Services Directive - as they have on REACH and the Seventh Research Framework Programme.
Parliament can also take a little pride in the increasingly influential role it has been playing in the legislative process - as the Commission President has just emphasised once more.
The President-in-Office has described our difficult relations with Russia.
This is indeed a difficult partnership, but we affirm that it must remain a partnership.
We also affirm that we do not want to secure our energy supply at the expense of our human rights.
We want both.
We need orderly relations with Russia, and we shall continue in our role as human-rights lawyer in that country, in Europe and worldwide.
On no account should we entertain the idea of bilateral treaties between EU Member States and Russia; there can be only a joint agreement between the EU and Russia.
This has to be made clear.
(Applause)
In the matter of Turkey, the President-in-Office of the Council has found a compromise solution that is good considering the circumstances.
On behalf of our group, I can state most firmly that we want a partnership and, if possible, friendship with Turkey.
Turkey is an important country.
We do not want a collision or clash with Turkey.
We are partners and also friends.
Nevertheless, Turkey, too, must honour its commitments, and that is why the path taken by the Presidency and Parliament together at the suggestion of the Commission is a good one.
A number of clarifications have been made within neighbourhood policy.
We have to understand that it is not possible for all the countries with a European outlook to join the EU.
Nevertheless, we affirm that we want good neighbourly relations.
The neighbourhood instrument for the countries to the south and east of the EU has been adopted, which represents a great success.
The Development Cooperation Instrument for the countries of Asia and Latin America has also been adopted.
In addition, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, in particular, provides us with the opportunity of acting without the agreement of the countries concerned. That will enable us to support democracy and human rights worldwide, including financially.
I believe that these are very positive developments.
The Constitution has featured in the comments of both the President-in-Office and the Commission President.
Speaking for the EPP component of our group, let no one mistake our resoluteness in affirming our desire for results, before the European elections, on the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the reforms, and also the common values that link us.
I hope that the joint declaration of 25 March - that is, the declaration by the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission - proves an early indicator of our will to lead the EU towards a better future.
Immigration has been mentioned.
It may even be our most important task to make a commitment to refusing to accept the misery and death being suffered at the borders of the EU and to opening our eyes to the poverty and concerns of the countries south of our borders.
If we really make the beginnings of a contribution to giving people a future in their own countries too, with our assistance, namely through dialogue - which will hopefully gain in intensity at the EU-Africa Summit - I believe this will be a step in the right direction.
Finally, allow me to say a few words of a more personal nature.
Last week, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats decided to elect a new chairman on 9 January.
This means that, after seven-and-a-half years, or 90 months, this will be my last speech as Chairman of this great - and sometimes difficult - group.
Of course, this is also true of the other groups.
Subsequently, on 15 January, our new Group Chairman will thank the President officially on behalf of the PPE-DE Group for his impressive work; whereas I should like to do so today on my own behalf.
The cooperation I have enjoyed with President Borrell has been constant.
It has also been very sincere and - I say this from my point of view and hope he can confirm it - very friendly throughout.
I should like to give him my sincere thanks for this.
I should also like to say a word of thanks to my fellow Members.
I wish to thank Mr Schulz, as the representative of his group - and also his predecessor Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, but particularly Mr Schulz - for the cooperation I have enjoyed with him.
This has always been based on professionalism, oriented towards our common convictions, where such exist - we have diverging convictions, too, of course.
Above all, I should like to thank him for the mutual trust that underpins our relationship.
The same goes for Mr Watson, whom I should also like to thank for the professional cooperation and the relationship of trust I have always enjoyed with him, as with his predecessor Mr Cox.
I wish to thank Mr Crowley, with whom I have always enjoyed a relationship of profound trust.
The next Group Chairman should ensure that the Chairman of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group also takes his place in the front row of the European Parliament.
Mr Wurtz, even though our opinions differ on many issues, we have nevertheless been fellow Members in this House since 1979.
Our cooperation has been characterised by mutual respect throughout, for which I am obliged to him.
Common ground has always existed with Mrs Frassoni, Mr Cohn-Bendit and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the issue of human rights.
There is even common ground with Mr Bonde on the issue of transparency, although I should like to add that there are few other issues of which this can be said.
There is common ground with Mrs BelohorskÃ¡, representing the non-attached Members, on the conviction that even those who do not have strength in numbers have the right to fair representation.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words to the Commission.
Mr Commission President, the formation of the present Commission was the toughest period of my political life - but that is now in the past.
I am glad that, under the leadership of the Commission President, the Commission has found its feet and is doing an impressive job.
Even though the Commission and Parliament have different roles, we nevertheless have a common goal, namely an EU that is strong and capable of action.
President Borrell, by way of conclusion, allow me to make a request, which I address to the political groups, the Chairmen and this House.
Let us show respect throughout our meetings here and in all our dealings with the other institutions.
Mutual respect establishes trust and, in turn, this trust benefits Europe.
I am certain that our dream can become reality: the dream of a strong Europe, a democratic Europe, a Europe capable of action, a Europe oriented towards the rule of law.
This is a new element in the 21st century.
I am convinced that, with this respect, this trust, the EU will develop to the benefit of our values and interests, both internally and externally.
(Sustained applause)
Thank you for your speech, Mr Poettering, and for your words.
You will have noticed that I have not been too strict with the time given the special circumstances surrounding Mr Poettering's speech and I will do the same for the other speeches.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has thanked the President-in-Office of the Council, which is a good thing, and I should like to join them in doing so.
I am much obliged to Mr Vanhanen of the Finnish Council Presidency, who I agree has done a good job.
Considering the circumstances under which the Finnish Presidency had to take leadership of the EU, I would even say he has done a very good job.
I also share Mr Vanhanen's view that the fact that journalists describe a summit as 'boring' does not necessarily make it a bad one.
It is true that journalistic bloodbaths are less important to the EU than tangible results, and so I, too, wish to judge this Summit on its results rather than on the boredom or joy it imparted to journalists.
I shall list two positive points.
This Summit sent out the clear message that Europe does admit its responsibility with regard to enlargement.
The enlargement process entails a responsibility on our part.
In the Balkans, in particular, prospective accession has had - and continues to have - a peacemaking effect.
A clear message was also sent out at the weekend to those who believe that enlargement can be continued without carrying out the reforms that are essential as part of the constitutional process.
This was that there will be no enlargement without the necessary reform of the EU.
That, too, is an important message, as those saying that enlargement should be carried out on the basis of the Treaty of Nice have to understand that the notion that Europe could function effectively, and meet popular expectations in the countries wishing to join the EU, on the basis of the existing treaty structures, has been reduced to absurdity.
Anyone in favour of enlargement, therefore - as the means to meet people's needs and make peace - needs a Europe that functions effectively.
For this reason, I should like to make it clear here that, without the reforms built into the constitutional process, there will be no enlargement with the support of my group, but with the constitutional reforms there shall be.
(Applause)
In the course of the debate at the weekend, we heard a second positive - in my opinion very positive - series of statements that will point the way ahead for the coming years.
The fact that the EU has declared its support for migration policy by moving away from just restrictions and admitting that we in this continent need migration and controlled immigration is a very positive signal.
'At long last,' it has to be said.
Here, too, however, this much is quite clear: the necessary legal armoury - the bridging clause - which is also in place under the Treaty of Nice, as has been rightly pointed out, is not being used.
If I were to describe an objective on the one hand, but on the other hand refuse to use the instruments I needed to achieve this objective, this would not make me very credible.
In that respect, this was not a boring Summit, but instead yet another wasted opportunity.
For this reason, it is my firm conviction that Parliament must apply further pressure on the Council to take consistent action once and for all and to say that, if we want to manage migration, we have to provide the EU with the legal armoury it needs to actually carry this out.
As all the speakers have now mentioned, Parliament, together with the Finnish Presidency, has brought to a conclusion two important legislative procedures that point the way ahead.
My group considers the Services Directive one of the greatest successes to date in terms of shaping the internal market.
A destructive neoliberal concept has been turned into socially responsible legislation.
The second concerns chemicals policy.
At the reception, I noticed representatives of the chemicals industry drinking sparkling wine with representatives of Greenpeace - so it cannot be such a bad piece of legislation.
As can be deduced from the heckling, my group worked to ensure that the legislation made it possible to reach a sensible compromise focusing on social equilibrium, industrial good sense and consumer rights.
I should like to extend warm thanks once more to Mrs Gebhardt and Mr Sacconi, who carried out pilot work in this connection on behalf of our group, for this great achievement by Parliament under the leadership of our group.
(Applause)
By way of conclusion, I should like to mention Mr Poettering's reference to the fact that his term of office as Chairman of the PPE-DE Group is coming to an end.
I do not want to address all the other Group Chairmen - I shall address him and him alone.
We have indeed enjoyed extremely constructive, collegial cooperation, for which I am obliged to him.
I should also like to pay Mr Poettering a great compliment.
I have to say that he is an extremely skilled politician - something I should like to illustrate with a little example from this morning.
Two-and-a-half years on, no one now remarks upon the wording of the phrase 'speaking for the EPP component of our group'.
Of course, the group is called the PPE-DE Group, and this phrasing implies that a whole section of his group is not even given the chance to speak.
After all, these are really two political groups, and the PPE component always says the opposite of what the ED part says.
In this respect, Mr Poettering has actually managed to be the Chairman of two groups without anyone noticing.
That is what I call political skill, and I compliment Mr Poettering on it.
(Laughter and applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, a man of this calibre is capable of greater things - just wait and see.
I am much obliged to him for the cooperation we have enjoyed.
There is one thing that has defined Mr Poettering as a personality since he became an MEP in 1979, and that is that one can disagree with him, argue with him, be annoyed with him or share one's happiness with him, but the fact always remains that one will never be misled by him.
He speaks clearly and is above all reliable.
In my opinion, these virtues are rare in politics and, the further one progresses in one's political career, the rarer they become.
When a politician has reached such a high level and has held on to them so tightly, he deserves thanks, recognition and best wishes.
(Applause)
I have not yet finished with the festive proceedings.
I shall not thank the President on behalf of my group colleagues for the performance of his duties just yet - that is for later - but I shall thank him and the Secretary-General for the fantastic job Parliament's services have done again this year.
We would not be able to do our jobs if it were not for the truly qualified and, above all, collegial and humanly impeccable input from Parliament's services.
I think that a few words should be addressed to the people I consider the true heroes of Parliament, namely the ladies and gentlemen behind the glass.
In my opinion, Parliament's interpreters do an outstanding job, a job without which this Parliament would be inconceivable.
(Applause)
I am grateful to one and all that I have finally been allowed to speak for eight-and-a-half minutes.
I am much obliged to the President.
(Laughter)
It is certainly rare for us to have so much time available in the European Parliament.
We should not abuse it.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Monty Python team once very uncharitably described Finland as a poor second to Belgium when going abroad.
Prime Minister, you and your government have shown that Finland is a poor second to none when it comes to running a European Union Presidency.
Thank you for your work in bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
Following on from the comitology agreement with the Austrians, you have opened legislation to public scrutiny.
I believe that 86% of legislative decisions under your Presidency have been taken in public: a total of 90 decisions compared with only 17 last year.
That is a great step forward and I hope that the German Presidency will take it further by getting agreement among Member States to publish the correlation tables so that we can see how Member States put into national law decisions taken at European level and make a fair comparison.
Prime Minister, you also have to your credit an agreement on REACH, an agreement on the Services Directive, on which thankfully - whatever Mr Schulz says - we defeated all the Socialist rapporteur's amendments, an agreement on next year's budget and an agreement to bring Bulgaria and Romania into our Union.
Liberals and Democrats also salute your efforts to try to get agreement on the footbridge Article 42 clause and we regret that this was not possible at the Lahti Summit, but we therefore disagree with paragraph 3 of the Presidency Conclusions, which says that the Union is 'making best use of the possibilities offered by the existing treaties to deliver concrete results'.
It is clearly not making best use of the possibilities, as you recognise a few paragraphs later, when we say that responding to the expectations of citizens is difficult with the existing decision-making procedures and that the framework needs to be strengthened.
I hope the German Presidency will get agreement on Article 42.
We cannot wait for a new Treaty and our message to Chancellor Merkel must be: Europa muss handlungsfÃ€hig sein.
Justice and home affairs is just one example of where such progress is needed.
We have talked a lot about migratory flows.
Hitherto, too much of the focus has been on security and too little on the economic or humanitarian aspects of these flows.
We therefore welcome the recognition in the Presidency Conclusions of the wider aspects, particularly the link between development policy and immigration policy and the need for a legal migration policy opening up the front door a little, in order better to close the back door to illegal migration.
More work is needed on illegal migration.
It is no good just to have a rapid enhancement of Frontex or permanent coastal patrols. They are only part of the answer.
We need to know why people are coming.
If you look at the other things you discussed at the summit about Sudan, if the European Union really recognised the new UN doctrine of the duty to protect, fewer people would be moving out of Sudan. Palestine, Lebanon, Afghanistan.
Unless we are able to provide security and good government and life chances for people there, they will continue to move.
It is no coincidence that some of these countries are the countries of origin of the greatest numbers heading towards our shores.
Perhaps the most important outcome of the Summit is paragraph 5: a strong statement on how enlargement has been a success.
Clearly if one looks at the Eurobarometer published last week, that message has not got through to our citizens.
We need leadership from our Heads of State and Government telling people what a success enlargement has been and how continued enlargement will be needed, once we have our constitutional arrangements in place.
If leadership is needed on enlargement it is needed, too, in ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.
On reading the sections in the Presidency Conclusions we see too much leadership has been left to the United States.
We are particularly concerned about the Eurojust arrangements signed with the USA.
Perhaps if we had the passerelle in foreign and security policy, we would be able to promote European values further and better.
Your Presidency has, in our view, been a success and we hope the return to the land of Santa Claus will allow you a good rest next week, undisturbed, I hope, by the clatter of reindeer hooves.
Mr Poettering has given his final speech to this House.
He has been a fair, frank, and I am pleased to say federalist companion.
The European Parliament needs an ideological majority rather than a groÃe Koalition.
We were pleased to work with him in an ideological majority for a while.
He will find that this
(DE) empty togetherness is nothing but accompanied loneliness.
Nonetheless, we wish him all the best for the future, whatever he ends up doing.
(Laughter and applause)
Thank you, Mr Watson.
I see that we have all been touched by the Christmas spirit.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I also wish to join my colleagues in thanking Prime Minister Vanhanen for the work of the Finnish Presidency.
I also wish to put on the record once again my thanks to Minister LehtomÃ€ki who, over the last six months, has been so good to all of us here in Parliament and has been most attentive and engaging at all times.
Several things immediately strike me with regard to the Summit.
Firstly, as the Prime Minister pointed out, there were no serious headlines highlighting a split or a division amongst the Member States of the European Union.
Whilst people may find that boring or dull, it leads to the conclusion that there has been a certain success, because only when there is failure do people put a spin on why the failure happened, to blame somebody else.
Therefore there is success concerning the decisions that have been taken.
That success is predicated under four Cs: consistency, coordination, cooperation and consensus.
Despite what people may think about using passerelle clauses to do this, that or the other, if the Member States' governments cannot agree to move forward together, nothing that you try to do is going to make that happen.
Likewise, when President Barroso speaks about competitiveness and the actions of the European Commission, of course we must be given leadership and ensure that leadership continues in so many different areas.
However, it is a mistake to speak of bringing in tax harmonisation through a back door, when it is clearly not within the powers in the Treaties.
Likewise, it is also a mistake to try to link budgetary reform to the adoption of a Constitution or a Constitutional Treaty and to further enlargement, because it sends out the wrong signals with regard to what the European Union should be about.
One of the major successes in the Council's Conclusions has been the idea of solidarity amongst the Member States concerning our dealings with Russia.
Russia's attempt to use a ban on meat exports from the European Union to try to pick off countries individually for bilateral agreements has given an opportunity to show there is a collective agreement amongst the Member States not to give in to that kind of negotiation.
We should treat Russia as an equal partner and an important neighbour but we must not be dominated simply by the strength that one partner has over another in certain areas.
Likewise, with regard to the question of immigration policy, it is not often that I agree with Mr Watson, but I agree with him on the key issue of looking at the core reasons why immigration takes place and why there is so much illegal immigration.
Why do people put their lives at risk by crossing thousands of miles of ocean to get to the promised land unless they are running away from something, some horror or danger to themselves?
We have spoken around the issue, but nobody mentions the issue of Darfur and the continuing genocide that is taking place there and the failure of the international community to respond and to react.
No matter how much we try to say what a great European Union we are, as the biggest donors of development aid, the largest participation force in the Congo and sending a signal as regards the kind of future world we want to see, we are still failing the people of Darfur who have no voice, who have no country to speak for them and, in fact, have been let down not just by the European Union and the US but by the United Nations itself.
Our resolve for 2007 should be to ensure that we will never see that occur again.
Finally, let me put on the record, after Mr Schulz has thanked the interpreters, that I also want to thank them for their work, because it is most important that we are understood.
To make sense of what Mr Schulz has to say is even more important, and I appreciate that from them as well.
Mr President, as you are finishing up, I wish to congratulate you on your work and I hope that you will continue your work in Parliament and rise to even greater heights.
(Applause)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Mr President, I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency for the generous commitment with which it has tackled issues of great importance - immigration, the Constitution, climate change - although we hope that you too, with clear Nordic realism, will reach the conclusion, with us, that nuclear energy has nothing whatsoever to do with solving the problem of climate change or emissions, as clearly demonstrated by the delays with your new energy plant, its prohibitive costs and the huge difficulties in completing it, as well as the series of incidents observed in recent months in various European locations, which have been passed over in total silence.
Having thanked the Presidency, I have to say that the direction of the debate, which defines this final summit as a Council towards a Europe of results, leaves me truly perplexed.
What are we talking about?
With regard to the issue of immigration, the previous Finnish Presidency achieved considerably more significant results in Tampere.
With regard to the issue of enlargement, ten years ago, before the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, we waged an enormous battle in this Parliament to ensure that the issues of the Constitution and institutional change were tackled earlier and better, as compared with an enlargement carried out hurriedly and which will certainly not benefit the majority of our citizens.
Next, with regard to the Constitution, we have reached the obvious point that many in this Parliament are trying to state, with greater or lesser success, depending on the degree of freedom allowed them by the great coalition: namely, that the text that was rejected in the referendums will obviously not be the same as that which is to be drafted, and that we will obviously have to look for alliances, within and outside the European Institutions, in order to be able to resolve the major problem of institutional reform.
We were also convinced, together with a group of MEPs in this Parliament, that before admitting Cyprus to our Union, it was necessary to resolve the problem of the division of the island, and today we are inheriting this failure to reach a solution by the European Union as a whole.
Therefore, quite frankly I can see nothing particularly new or specific.
Am I happy with this situation?
No, I am not happy, but nonetheless I can see the need for transparency, with respect to our citizens too.
It is clear that we are fully in agreement with the idea that Turkey should remain a partner, that there should be further enlargements and that it is necessary to give the Balkan countries an unambiguous prospect of accession.
At the same time, however, we certainly cannot accept the hypocrisy that is being passed off as a great novelty, whereby today talking of institutional reform means, in some way, placing an obstacle in the way of enlargement.
We cannot accept it, because it is not the case and should not be the case.
Mr President, before thanking Mr Poettering I would like to touch on one final point, which has to do with relations with Russia.
We absolutely must be aware of the fact that the best policy to adopt with regard to President Putin is a policy that makes us independent, or at least as independent as possible, which means reducing our consumption by 30% and promoting renewable energy with even greater conviction. Otherwise, we will always be dependent, if not on Russia then on another country.
Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Poettering for his kindness towards us and also for the fact that, in some cases, we have managed to work quite well together.
On behalf of my group, I would like to offer him our best wishes for his future - which in part also depends on my future, but this remains to be seen - and to express, as well, the wish that he will still be able to fight for Europe, because this Parliament truly has need of champions.
On this point he would be following the approach initiated to a certain degree by President Borrell, who has attempted to advance the idea of an autonomous Parliament, with varying degrees of support from his troops.
I also hope that in the future - if you will allow me this personal observation - if Parliament gives him a majority, he will put to one side a certain emphasis that is a little too close to a religion, which benefits neither Europe nor Parliament.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, as this is the last plenary joint debate of the year, I too wish to take the opportunity to express my thanks.
First of all, I should like to express personal thanks to the President for the conscientious work he has done, and also for the constructive cooperation the two of us have enjoyed.
I should also like to thank the Secretariat, Mr Priestley and all Parliament's staff for their truly excellent joint work.
We all know how difficult it can be at times for this Parliament to really function as well as we should all like.
I should also like to address Mr Poettering, including on behalf of my Group Chairman Mr Wurtz personally, as he has not been allocated any speaking time today.
Mr Poettering belongs to a different political group, but I think that that is a good thing.
It stimulates the exchange of opinions and is important for democracy.
It is also important, however, to be able to cooperate constructively across the group divide - and we have done so in recent years.
My Group Chairman Mr Wurtz, who, like Mr Poettering, belongs to the special 'club of six' who have been fighting for European integration since 1979, will certainly take the next opportunity to underline this publicly in person.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the Finnish Council Presidency, and for the constructive cooperation there has been between the Presidency and Parliament.
I am stating this expressly in spite of the fact that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left cannot support the two main projects that were set in motion during the Finnish Presidency - the Services Directive and REACH - as they stand.
To Mr Schulz I would say that I do not see any reason to boast as he has done, as the two Directives demonstrate that Europe has yet to move away from neoliberal policies, and, as we see it, the Directives are certainly not masterpieces.
(Applause)
Mr President-in-Office, I wish to expressly welcome, on behalf of my group, the decision taken at the Summit to keep the doors of the EU open to new members and to honour the commitments we have made to the countries participating in the enlargement process.
It is true that no one can predict accurately at present how soon after Bulgaria and Romania we shall be able to welcome new countries into the EU, but it must remain clear that all the European countries that share our common values and meet the conditions for admission, particularly the Copenhagen criteria, have a right to apply for membership of the EU.
It is my personal conviction that the Treaty of Nice in force is not a suitable basis for future enlargement.
That is why it is necessary, with a view to the future of the EU, to strengthen the Union's integration capacity and to launch a truly comprehensive, far-reaching reform of the Union of 27.
The candidate countries are not the only ones who have to change; the Union itself, first and foremost, has to do its homework.
From my point of view, this entails finding a universally accepted way out of the constitutional crisis during the German Council Presidency.
It is crucial, however, Mr President-in-Office, that we prove once and for all - and not only to the people of France and the Netherlands - that the period of reflection will also entail consequences for other aspects of politics.
Advertising brochures will be no help to us there.
The people must be able to associate their personal vision for the future for themselves and their families with Europe once again.
Work and social security - this is what they expect from Europe.
Decent working conditions, genuinely equal opportunities in education and careers, protection in case of illness, a guaranteed minimum income - all of this counts.
To the President of the Commission I say that this would really be a Europe of results.
If, however, the Union and its Member States continue as they have been doing, and wage dumping, social dumping and playing workers off against each other across borders remain people's everyday experiences, Europe will continue to lose support.
That is exactly what must not happen, however, and that is why, Mr President-in-Office and Mr President of the Commission, the issue of social justice must be a top political priority.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, my congratulations to Mr Vanhanen and the Finnish Presidency.
You have passed the test.
You have proved yourselves to be good Europeans and you have done so by ratifying the EU Constitution through your own parliament, ignoring the fact that in a recent opinion poll only one in four of your population supported that course of action.
So Mr Barroso must be very pleased with you.
Your Presidency sums up the whole EU project: an exercise in political dishonesty, where the views of ordinary people count for very little.
Well, the Constitution may be dead, but its contents most certainly are not and your Presidency Conclusions talk about the need for further enlargement.
Under justice and home affairs you - and we heard Mr Barroso earlier - talk about the need to improve decision-making.
Well, that word means more power for the European Union.
You praise the idea of a common energy policy and increasing activism in foreign affairs.
Carry on regardless!
That has been the policy of the Finnish Presidency and you now hand over to Angela Merkel and the German Presidency and they are even more ambitious than you are.
It is now clear that the plan is to come back with a new treaty.
You are going to drop the dreaded C word. Will the French and Dutch be asked to vote again?
No, of course they will not.
That duty will fall to Ireland and possibly Denmark and you - nearly all of you in this room, all the EU institutions - will do everything they can with taxpayers' money to bully those small countries into submission.
In Britain it will not wash.
We have already gone a treaty too far and the voice of the people will be heard.
We have seen this morning in this EU Parliament self-congratulation and backslapping.
You all ought to be very thankful that the proceedings in this Chamber get so little press coverage.
I think the general public of Europe would be appalled!
Thank you, and a happy Christmas to everybody.
(Laughter)
British humour!
(NL) Mr President, like Mr Farage, I fear that I too will shatter the overworked consensus that was mentioned a moment ago.
Failed European summits are starting to become one of our traditions.
These failures are always eventually wrapped in fine euphemisms in order not to hurt the presidency's feelings too much.
This summit, though, about the enlargement strategy - which is suddenly being taken down a gear - has been yet another complete waste of time.
Whilst the accession negotiations with Turkey are being put on hold for the moment, Ankara's attitude towards Cyprus, as well as to other matters, such as the freedom of the press and the Armenian question, should result in the negotiations being brought to a permanent halt rather than a merely temporary one.
Allow me, as a Fleming, to express my surprise and indignation at the level of arrogance with which some spokespeople of the official Europe feel the need to interfere in the freedom of press and domestic politics of other Member States.
What a travesty!
For years, we have been told that we must, and indeed shall, welcome the Asian Turkey in our midst in due course, but that the small and prosperous region of Flanders, located at the heart of Europe, must not become an independent Member State of the EU, as we found out last week.
This is how Mr Juncker from Luxembourg - but he was not alone - suddenly felt the need to denounce the startling report that is half-fiction, half-documentary, which the French-speaking public television station RTBF broadcast last Wednesday about the scenario of Flemish independence, something that Europe apparently cannot tolerate.
So the Flemings know where they stand with these Heads of State or Government.
After all, Mr Juncker and his colleagues have decreed, without tolerating any opposition, that the Belgian monarchy must be sustained.
Nobody else has a say.
This is not exactly what you would call great respect for the freedom of opinion, let alone the right to self-determination of peoples, when foreign Heads of State assume that they can interfere in the freedom of press in a Member State and ignore the will of the Flemings.
This will of the Flemings, however, is very democratic and legitimate.
Flanders wants to be freed from the Socialist Party's corrupt dictatorship in Wallonia and from the dastardly royal offspring of the House of Saxe-Coburg.
Like the Czechs and Slovaks, we want to avail ourselves of the right to self-determination.
It is not the European Heads of State who should dictate to Flanders when it comes to how it should address the future.
Thank you very much, Mr Dillen.
That brings to an end the speeches by the Group spokespersons.
We will now hear from the individual Members who have requested the floor.
Mr President, thank you for that pronunciation.
Stubb turns to 'Stub' and I think that next year it will be 'Schtub', so it is all going in the right direction.
I have three brief points to make.
Firstly, I would like to thank and congratulate the Finnish Presidency, especially four Ministers, and then a group of people.
The four Ministers are Prime Minister Vanhanen - I think he did a fantastic job; Minister LehtomÃ€ki, who did a fantastic job; Foreign Minister Tuomioja, who did a great job; and then there is one Minister who is absent, Mr Pekkarinen.
Most of all I would like to thank the civil servants, especially Ambassador Eikka Kosonen.
We all know that the machinery does not work without the civil service.
If you were to put pluses and minuses on the Presidency, I think the pluses would far exceed the minuses - Lebanon, the Services Directive, REACH, research, enlargement, climate change and Schengen.
I think you did a very good job on that.
I should like to say to Mr Schulz that the last person I want lecturing me on the Services Directive is a German Socialist.
As regards alcohol tax, I think there is a minus, but as a consumer I do not really mind the fact that you failed to raise alcohol tax.
To finish off, I would like to say that the Finnish Presidency was cool, calm and collected.
If you could personify things, I would say that you, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, were Mrs Cool.
Mr Vanhanen, you were Mr Calm, and I think you, Mr Tuomioja, were Mr Collected.
(Applause)
(PT) I should like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on the calmness with which it performed its duties, which was the right approach given the tension around the world.
As regards the Council, highly important issues were of course addressed and the balance that we saw between the Presidency of the Council and the Presidency of the Commission brought these issues to the fore.
That being said, I was surprised that little attention was paid to the Middle East conflict, given recent developments such as the recent upsurge in violence and the possibility of elections being brought forward.
I was similarly surprised at the conclusion issued by the Council on the holding of the EU-Africa Summit, which I feel is indicative of a significant step forward in relations between Europe and Africa.
(FR) Presidents of the three institutions, I am going to concentrate solely on the re-launch of the constitutional process.
A few days ago I sent you a document which, as the Finnish Presidency has said, shows that the package cannot be reopened, which is a good thing.
On the other hand, if the dossier has to be clarified as the Heads of State have said, that clarification must be concerned with what is constitutional and what is not; that will be a much more complicated exercise than simply separating the first and second parts from the rest.
The third aspect of what I propose relates to the means of validating this 'thing'.
It will have to be put before the European citizens again, and why not do it transnationally, as Parliament says, holding a referendum everywhere on the same day.
Finally, whatever the text looks like, it must be allowed to develop, subject to the votes of a super-qualified majority, a double super-qualified majority, 80 or 90% perhaps, of the Member States and parliaments, but certainly not 100%.
Populations and future generations cannot be taken hostage.
I think that is a basis on which things can develop in the days ahead.
They will move very quickly.
On 26 January, the 'yes' countries will be meeting in Madrid.
Ten days later, the 'no' countries, acknowledged or presumed, will be meeting in Luxembourg.
For pity's sake, do all you can to get these things moving.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Finnish Presidency.
As a representative from a neighbouring country, I am proud to be a neighbour to Finland these days.
You have achieved a lot and have shown that Europe is moving.
That is important because all the things we have discussed this morning show that we are able to move Europe forward.
However, that also to some extent highlights the challenges we are facing when we discuss environment policy and greenhouse effects or the need for more competitiveness or the need to face globalisation or the need to do something about the developments in Iran.
All these discussions result from the fact that we are able to take a higher degree of responsibility than ever before.
When we are discussing the new challenges from countries applying to join the Union, that is a result of achievements and success, not of the failure, Mr Farage.
If we had failed no one would want to be a member of this Union and now they want to be members of this Union because of our success.
We have more steps to take.
A credible Union needs a credible common foreign and security policy.
Happy Christmas, Mr President.
Thank you very much, and the same to you, Mr HÃ¶kmark.
. - (FI) Mr President, regarding the Presidency we could say that it went very well indeed in the way it dealt with the crisis in Lebanon, and its success with REACH and the Services Directive.
They are all important issues.
I especially appreciate the trouble that was gone to over cooperation with Russia.
Lahti was an excellent example of this, and, although we know what went on at the Helsinki meeting, the Lahti approach is what we need to adhere to here and we have to begin to act accordingly in the wake of it.
Perhaps the only negative issue is idealism over enlargement, which is troubling the Finnish Government.
For six months Turkey has shown how difficult things get if we move forward too fast.
We really need to insist that terms and conditions are met, and we should give them sufficient time.
Prime Minister, you are wrong when you say that there should not be any barriers.
The public expects us to have a vision of how large Europe will be in 10 to 20 years' time.
Our citizens would rather have a small Europe that works than one which is too large and which functions poorly.
(Applause)
(FI) Mr President, during the course of the Union's history we have frequently seen how small Member States find themselves having to keep the principle of integration alive, when the large Member States have their own problems.
Finland has been praised for establishing an excellent working atmosphere, and this way such hard compromises as the Services Directive and the chemicals regulation were achieved.
It was once again clear, however, that although Parliament's political powers are growing all the time, fortunately it retains the ability to arbitrate between the large political groups when it comes to the big issues.
The governments of all Member States need to pay more attention to this when they discuss issues with their own national parliaments.
Mr President, we wish Germany the best of luck and economic success too, because experience shows that the contribution made by the big Member States to European cooperation improves as their economies grow healthier.
It seems appropriate to hope that Germany will not put the brakes on enlargement policy.
So far all enlargements have been economic and political successes.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Finnish Presidency, above all for the way it dealt with the highly delicate strategic partnership with Russia.
It appears to me that the Finnish presidency has done a great deal in dealing calmly but firmly with Russia, securing it as a strategic economic partner, whilst at the same time putting some pressure on the country to respect human rights and democracy at home.
The presidency's second achievement is the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union.
And I would also like to congratulate it for ratifying the European Constitution.
I believe that the Finnish Presidency is a good example of how to act on the European level to promote deeper integration, and how to achieve deeper integration whilst also opening the European Union to the outside world.
(NL) Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the Finnish Presidency for its good cooperation with regard to the development instrument.
We talked about REACH and the framework programme, an Act, accounting for 17 billion, for the next few years involving the Millennium Goals; I am very grateful for the way in which we managed to get this off the ground.
I have two questions.
First of all, with regard to Darfur, to which Mr Crowley and Mr Watson have already referred, it is in some ways intolerable that we should be obliged to watch as these human rights violations in Darfur get worse and worse, without being able to respond effectively.
I would again ask you to consider the possibility of a special UN initiative and of the promotion of others of the kind.
Secondly, as for enlargement, you are in favour of it but at the same time prescribe requirements with regard to the Treaty.
Make up your mind.
Why not say that we should first be more democratic and more effective before we can enlarge.
We are keen to enlarge, but we need these requirements.
Be clear and show leadership, otherwise we will remain stuck in this sneaky and slippery way of going about things, which is hardly effective.
(FR) Mr President, the Finnish Presidency told us we needed a Europe of results.
We have indeed obtained those results, thanks to the European Parliament; I would go so far as to say that 2006 was the Year of Parliament, because it was able to show that it had real political vision and that it was not a rubber-stamp chamber.
I will mention the Services Directive, REACH, etc.
On Turkey, you told us that Turkey's accession process was only slowed down.
You tell us the European Union's borders are set by our values, but our values are universal and we cannot take in everyone.
Do we want a European Europe or an Asian Europe?
President Barroso referred to the European Union's integration capacity, saying it was essential.
Geographical borders do need to be defined, because Europe will not be built without the agreement of the European nations.
Finally, regarding the passerelle clauses, everyone agrees that a qualified majority would be required, but when it comes to immigration policy we still need to agree first on what we want to do with that immigration policy.
Some are opening their borders wide; others, on the other hand, want to develop agreements with the developing countries.
The German Presidency will therefore have a tremendous amount of work to do; I wish it good luck.
(NL) Mr President, I too am indebted to the Finnish Presidency.
I have a question in connection with relations with Russia.
Trade, especially agricultural trade, is currently experiencing major problems as a result of veterinary or phytosanitary objections.
Are people, including the Commission, taking the view that there are genuinely technical reasons, or is there a political reason behind all this, and if so, how do people intend to resolve this?
(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the House for this debate.
We have now achieved a wonderful compromise and consensus, which is praiseworthy, particularly if this atmosphere can rub off on certain national parliaments.
I do, however, have one doubt and one word of warning: the statements of some leaders contain a sort of intellectual blackmail which I do not like at all.
Some of them say that institutional reform is a condition of further enlargement.
Let us not shut the door to the European Union, at least for countries such as Croatia and Macedonia, which are European countries, and make them wait until we have decided whether or not to carry out institutional reform.
It is my firm conviction that this divisive issue should not be used as a pretext for refusing entry to countries that have already achieved a lot on the road to accession.
(FI) Mr President, during its presidential term, Finland promoted qualified majority decisions on third pillar issues by means of the passerelle clauses.
The historical notion that nations have had of right and wrong, however, is only written into national laws, and that constitutes the legitimacy of societies.
EU laws are synthetic laws used in matters of justice for half a billion people.
They are compromises which no one originally wanted.
They eat away at the EU's legitimacy, as does the Constitutional Treaty still under discussion, which requires unanimity for it to be adopted.
It requires unanimity, and because that has not happened, it is defunct as a consequence.
When it comes to the Constitution, Finland has acted as a minesweeper for Germany and the next presidency.
Unfortunately, during its term the Finnish Presidency has not made the legitimacy of the EU any stronger in the eyes of its citizens.
It has just photocopied the message of the elite to the people.
Mr President, the strongest statement that the President-in-Office made in his speech was in advocating more communitarian-friendly procedures.
Six months ago I saw some Euroscepticism in your EU approach, but when you said that qualified majority voting and the codecision procedure with the European Parliament are the best and most effective way to govern the European Union, that was the best part of your speech.
This also makes it clear that rotating presidencies still have some meaning in the European Union.
At least it keeps the Member States better committed to the European Union and its common policies.
I should also like to say to those who said that Turkey's accession talks will slow down that this will not happen.
Of the 35 negotiating chapters, only eight are closed, which is a very good result for the Finnish Presidency.
Twenty-seven chapters are still open to advancement and going forward.
In fact, Turkey's accession talks will be much improved as a result of this excellent Finnish Presidency.
I can only echo what my colleagues have already said.
(Applause)
- (PL) Mr President, almost everything that can be said, has been said.
It was a good presidency and we are grateful for it.
Despite the impasse on the constitutional process, there has been progress - 'Europe on the move'.
An example is the adoption of 'Schengen for all'.
This is extremely important for the new Member States.
This presidency has also shown, despite some foot-dragging and perhaps reluctance, how important solidarity is in external relations, and how important it is not to leave any Member State in the lurch.
President Barroso deserves particular thanks here.
If the principle of unilateral thinking is necessary to secure this principle of solidarity, we should keep it up until solidarity becomes an automatic response and prevails over national and economic selfishness.
One further point: I am dissatisfied by the reduction of eastern policy to the northern and Russian dimension, to the exclusion of the issues of Ukraine and Belarus.
(ET) I would like to talk about Russia.
According to the European Union's official position, the blockade of Polish meat products in Russia is a bilateral matter in which Brussels will not intervene.
The EU uses the same pretext to avoid demanding Russia ratify the Estonian-Russian Border Treaty.
The Kremlin eagerly supports this foolish behaviour.
Now Russia is blockading all food imports from the European Union at most border crossing points.
Russia's next well-considered step was to offer the five leading exporters bilateral agreements for food exporting.
Absurd.
Russia understands the European Union inside out.
Russia is putting our agricultural policy and solidarity to the test.
As Mr Vanhanen correctly said: 'We must open our eyes about Russia.'
In the Putin era Russia is led by people for whom the Cold War was their life and work.
As was the case with that conflict, Europe will emerge triumphant only if it remains true to its core values, democracy and human rights.
I wish the new president luck.
(FI) Mr President, I also wish to express my appreciation of the Finnish Presidency in just a few words.
There have been quite a few speeches here appraising the term and its success.
These are six-month presidencies, and as such they are perhaps difficult to judge purely quantitatively.
Thinking qualitatively, however, I can say that Finland has done well in legislative projects and taken them forward.
We made headway on REACH, the Services Directive, the seventh framework research programme, and so on. Let me say that, as a Finn, I have been especially happy that our ministers have been here on frequent occasions, in particular Minister LehtomÃ€ki.
This shows that Finland is keen to get to grips with these issues, become involved, and bring its own skills and know-how to joint European decision-making.
So I might say that this Presidency ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Mr President, as far as external policy is concerned, the European Union has shown its weakness by not having a single standpoint.
Presidencies, which are short-lived, may come and go, but a common platform of well-defined objectives must remain, at least over the long term, because at the end of the day the European Union must be a union not of governments, but of ordinary citizens, and this is a challenge that we must face, and in which I wish all actors of the European institutions success in 2007.
(ES) Mr President, as your mandate is drawing to an end, I would like to thank you for your visits to Poland.
I would like such visits to become a tradition of this House.
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe will play a more important role in the European Union than that conferred on them up until now by the Member States of the Europe of Fifteen.
Thank you very much, Mr Zaleski, and congratulations on your perfect command of Spanish. It is an incentive for me to try to learn your language.
You are a fluent Spanish speaker.
Mr President, I rise if only to show that not all Brits agree with the somewhat eccentric views expressed by Mr Farage just now.
Monsieur Farage claims that it is somehow wrong for the Presidency - any Presidency presumably - to try to find a solution to the Constitutional Treaty.
In his argument he says that the people have said no.
Yet he only wants to listen to the answer that suits him.
He only wants to listen to those who have said no.
He fails to recognise that 18 Member States have said yes, even where a referendum was held.
If you add them all together, more people have said yes than have voted no, so it is right to persevere and find a compromise.
That compromise must take account of the views of those who said no, but it must also take account of the large majority who have said yes.
(Applause)
(EL) Mr President, I shall confine myself to the reference which the President-in-Office of the Council made to the issue of enlargement, especially as far as Turkey is concerned.
If the translation I heard was correct, I would ask him to correct the reference which he made to 'Northern Cyprus'.
There is no such concept either on maps or on bills and, if direct trade is to be facilitated, it will only be done by withdrawing the 40 000 soldiers of the occupying force in this area of Cyprus.
Mr President, Europe will gain the support of its citizens by coming up with practical initiatives that respond to what they expect from us.
The Finnish Presidency has rightly given priority to a number of those initiatives: to safer chemicals, to cleaner cars and to creating jobs through the Services Directive, for which I particularly thank them.
Let us remember, colleagues - contrary to the rhetoric of Mr Schulz in particular - that the most important thing we can deliver for social Europe is more jobs and economic growth, which is what the Services Directive will do.
However, I want to make a plea to you, Prime Minister, in your role as a continuing member of the Council.
Those directives that you got through will be effective only if the Member States do their job properly and if they transpose them quickly and effectively.
Will you guarantee to put them on the agenda at Council level to ensure that your work is not wasted by ineffective and inefficient work by member governments?
(PL) Mr President, in the debate of 5 July 2006 on the programme of the Finnish Presidency I expressed my hope that the Finns, with their tradition of good relations with Russia, would make the effort to resolve two issues that are important for the European Union as a whole.
The first was the need to make Russia stop using energy to blackmail some members of the European Union, and the second concerned the lifting of restrictions on the import of food products to Russia.
Unfortunately in December 2006 there has been little progress on either issue.
Particularly shocking is the situation regarding access of food products to the Russian market, which forced Poland to take the drastic step of vetoing the EU-Russia agreement thus turning the problem into one that affects all Member States.
I hope that the Germany presidency will act quickly to resolve these two issues.
Mr President, I want to welcome the Summit Conclusions on immigration.
They take us one step closer to a more balanced immigration policy and one based on solidarity.
For far too long we have been focusing on long-term measures in the hope that we would solve immigration problems through development policy.
Clearly this has not been successful and this means that we must not only strengthen long-term measures on development policy but also undertake short-term measures to stem the flow of illegal immigration.
Today we see that the entire burden is on the southern Member States, which are simply inundated by the incessant flow of illegal immigration.
Therefore, the Summit Conclusions in this respect take us one step further because they include a series of concrete steps in this regard.
(SL) This has been the last presidency of a European Union composed of 25 Member States, and I should like to add to the chorus of tributes already offered a tribute to the culture in which this presidency has been conducted, as I think that has constituted an important dimension and been a significant part of the success of this presidency.
I am happy to note an increased amount of agreement, particularly on the question of enlargement.
We have also seen agreement between the three main institutions, which has not always been the case.
In addition, I am particularly happy to note the changes concerning the enlargement of the Schengen area, which is strengthening credibility and trust within the Union.
I do have one regret, however, concerning our continued failure to establish a supervisory body for the Galileo programme under the 2003 Council decision.
I hope that this will take place as provided for in this decision, which stipulates the establishment of such centres in the future in the new Member States, and I should also like to congratulate Finland for having joined the ranks of the Member States who have ratified the Constitutional Treaty.
Mr President, on behalf of its southern neighbours I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency.
I fully agree with what you said, Mr Prime Minister, that the borders of Europe are not drawn on maps but defined by common values.
Second point. We need to address this huge gap of popular opinion through joint efforts.
We need to exchange our experiences, our prejudices, our fears.
Practice shows that often these fears are not founded.
We need to share common historic experiences and common fears and this will be, I hope, a real way to ratify the Constitutional Treaty.
Mr President, my thanks and congratulations to all those involved in the Finnish Presidency.
I have felt for some time that the success of a Presidency is inversely proportional to the size of the country.
And so to the Constitutional Treaty. The Irish are due to ratify by referendum, but my question is: which text?
We have had President Borrell Fontelles telling us that there is no doubt the text will not be implemented as it stands.
He said that in Italy.
In Ireland recently he said we must go ahead and ratify the text as it stands.
I was not there; I was in Brussels voting at a part-session.
The Presidency has been saying today that the text has its merits, but the dilemma is that it cannot be presented again exactly as it stands to the French and Dutch.
On the other hand, 18 Member States have already ratified it.
We have heard from my good colleague, Mr Poettering, who wants ratification of the Constitutional Treaty.
Mixed messages are going out.
The countries that have to ratify it by referendum particularly need clear guidance.
Is it the existing text or do we wait for a new text?
Yes, it is over to the Germans.
A happy Christmas to everybody.
Mr President, first I wish to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on completing Romanian and Bulgarian accession.
However, unlike most speakers in the House, I am glad Mr Vanhanen maintained unanimity on justice and home affairs, an area seen by countries, particularly my own United Kingdom, as one of delicate national sovereignty.
I am also grateful he accepted some of my report's amendments on higher duty-free allowances coming into the European Union from third countries by air or sea.
The Council was also right to suspend eight chapters of the Turkish accession process, but now more must be done to help end the isolation of the Northern Turkish Cypriot community.
I agree that it is also right to get tough and speak toughly with Russia.
It is also a great idea to negotiate free trade agreements with Asian democracies such as India.
Lastly, enlargement in the Western Balkans, in particular Croatia, is now a German Presidency priority, but we do not need a full-blown EU Constitution to achieve that.
. - (PL) Mr President, I agree that the last six months have been overshadowed by relations between the European Union and Russia.
What more can we say.
I can but join President Saryusz-Wolski in thanking President Borrell, the Chairman of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and the Premier for his position, thanks to which the European Union is becoming more united.
I would like to add to the list of this presidency's practical achievements, which have not already been mentioned, the European Institute of Technology project adopted in Lahti.
This in my view is an appropriate response to the present global competition for the most outstanding scientists, and here again I would like to congratulate President Barroso for his persistence in bringing this project to life.
Finally I would also like to express my satisfaction with the words spoken in this House by the Finnish premier, who said that what is happening in Belarus is a disgrace on Europe.
An end must be put to the regime there and a European Union of greater internal solidarity will be more effective in its external relations and will be capable of changing this situation.
- (SK) As we in Europe are currently enjoying the benefits of peace, and given that no wars are raging, one can only be pleased that the last meeting of the European Union in Brussels was termed 'remarkably quiet and boring'.
In my view, the Summit was highly business-like and of great importance for the idea of a unified and non-discriminatory Europe.
By this I mean free movement without passport controls for all, including citizens from the new Member States.
Mr President of the Council, the Finnish presidency conveyed an important message to all Europeans.
Within the context of the so-called Schengen area, the border of Europe will move eastwards as of 1 January 2008, from the Czech-German to the Slovakia-Ukraine border.
The Finnish presidency set the necessary basic tone.
I believe that Slovakia in particular, together with all the new Member States, will meet all of the requirements and that the Schengen area will be extended.
I wish all of you a Merry Christmas.
(PL) Mr President, Prime Minister, six months ago you outlined two main priorities for your presidency: energy and European innovation.
In energy progress is extremely difficult - something of which we are well aware - and this is something that we will undoubtedly have to deal with over the next six months.
However, I would like to congratulate you on completing the seventh framework programme and implementing it.
I would also like to congratulate President Barroso.
The collaboration between Parliament and the Council and the Commission in the field of innovation was generally exemplary.
We can now make ourselves understood in many matters that are important to Europe.
There is no European victory or civilisation that is of importance on a world scale without economic innovation.
For this reason I repeat my congratulations both to the Commission and to the European Council for their success in this field.
Thank you very much, Mr Buzek.
We have now come to the end of speeches based on the procedure of opening the floor without a previously established list of speakers.
It is now the turn of the Presidents of the Council and the Commission.
Parliament will understand if you are unable to respond exhaustively to all of the questions that have been raised.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, thank you for excusing me from not commenting on absolutely every view put forward and especially with regard to those opinions which were the same as mine.
I would nonetheless like to mention one, where the speaker was clearly of another opinion.
Mr Farage said that we would like the Union to have more power.
That is not the issue here: the Union already has a good deal of competence.
The question is that the Union should have the means and tools to exercise its competence.
It is always most important in politics, and in any exercise of power, that when you allocate a role and power for something you also have to have the tools to do it.
At present, the Council, in particular, does not have these means available to it owing to decision-making and voting systems and requirements of unanimity.
Parliament's work shows that, despite differences in ideology, it can almost always take decisions by voting, but the votes are generally preceded by very long negotiations, in which compromises are sought and results achieved.
I would endorse what Mrs GrossetÃªte said that 2006 has been Parliament's year in particular.
This year has seen perhaps some of the biggest legislative projects of this decade brought to conclusion.
A number of issues were mentioned in this debate that are European in nature and in which the Union has competence in itself, but we also need to be able to make decisions.
One of the challenges of the future will be facing us already next year, when a decision must also be taken on the European Institute of Technology.
The European Council declared that 2007 should be the year to make a decision on that.
The Commission and the Council are going to have plenty of work to do next year regarding this.
With regard to enlargement, I think that we need to focus particular attention on the Western Balkans.
Enlargement is a way for the people of the Western Balkans to commit solidly to stability and democracy, and we have time in the Union both to make our own amendments to the Treaty and to continue negotiations on enlargement.
We in the Union and the Member States must just take responsibility for ensuring that the negotiations on the Constitutional Treaty reach a conclusion so that the timetable for the European Parliament elections in 2009 can be put in place.
If we succeed in this, there are bound not to be any problems with enlargement either.
Mr President, thank you for the privilege of allowing me to be present here in Parliament's last sitting this year and to witness spirited political dialogue in which ideological hurdles can be surmounted in the name of cooperation.
The early part of this debate in particular was evidence of that.
We too in Finland have learnt to work closely together across ideological borders at government level too, and it has also been a great pleasure to be involved in this same sort of cooperation here at EU level.
My sincere thanks to everyone.
One or two specific questions were asked, one of which related to Russian agricultural trade.
I believe that the President of the Commission will reply to that.
(Applause)
President of the Commission. Mr President, we in the Commission are used to having the more difficult questions to solve!
This was indeed a successful Presidency and, as someone said, it was the last Presidency of a European Union of 25 members.
On 1 January 2007 we are going to welcome Romania and Bulgaria.
One of the achievements of these last six months was the finalisation of all these processes - the ratification in the Member States.
The good work that has been done was important, as was the election, with a great deal of support, of the two new Commissioners from Romania and Bulgaria.
Once again, I would like to thank Parliament for its support.
It was a very clear signal of this Parliament's support for the enlarged European Union.
Regarding Russia, I think the debates we have had over the past six months have been helpful in establishing the basis for our relationship with Russia.
Russia is a very important partner, a close neighbour and a partner with whom we want to have a strategic long-term relationship.
We should avoid two risks.
One is the 'business as usual' approach, pretending that everything is going in the right direction.
It is not.
There are some concerns.
Another risk is a kind of confrontational position with Russia.
I do not think this is in our interests, nor is it in the interests of all those who want a democratic, progressive Russia.
We should have a constructive, positive engagement with Russia, trying to make it a win-win situation, namely on the energy issue.
I have said before that we were divided from Russia and the Soviet Union for so long because of our ideologies.
Let us not now be divided from Russia because of energy.
Let us make it a positive factor.
They need a stable market as much as we need a stable supplier, but at the same time, while we are engaged with this constructive position, we should also be very firm on matters of principle, namely on human rights.
On this matter we have to tell our Russian partners that this is non-negotiable.
That is the position we have been taking publicly and privately in the talks with our Russian partners.
When it comes to Russia, we will be able to control some events but not others.
The future of Russia will depend mainly on the dynamics of Russia.
It is a huge country.
It would be a mistake to think that we can control its future.
We do not and should not control that.
However, there is something we can control, which is solidarity among our Member States.
We have to ask all the Member States to keep a united and coherent approach to Russia and not give in to any pressure to divide us, for instance on the issues that are now on the table.
That depends on us.
We can have a common approach to Russia if we really want to.
There have been some attempts to divide us but at the Lahti Summit we were able to speak with one voice on energy.
Now, in the face of an embargo on one of our Member States, we can also express a common position.
We hope that common position is maintained when it comes to the mandate for the future framework agreement with Russia.
I hope that matter can be solved.
I hope the Member States will be unanimous in supporting a mandate so we can continue with the strategy I have just outlined as a good position for Europe and a position that is also useful for the future of our relations with Russia.
This principle of solidarity has to be a cornerstone in our external relations and also in how we build the European Union.
Finally, since we now know that Mr Poettering has addressed us for the last time as the Chairman of the PPE-DE Group, let me also express my gratitude and recognition for everything he has done as leader of such an important group in the European Parliament and say how much I appreciate his sincere commitment to our European values.
I hope that the commitment he has shown in leading such an important political group will be maintained in future for the service of Europe, so we shall not say goodbye or adieu but just Auf Wiedersehen.
I wish you all a merry Christmas and a very good 2007.
(Applause)

Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 1.25 p.m.)
Formal sitting: Welcoming of the Bulgarian and Romanian Members
Ladies and gentlemen, it is with joy and excitement that we today welcome the 153 new Members from Bulgaria and Romania.
On behalf of us all, I welcome you most warmly and wish you great success in your first term of office as Members of the European Parliament.
I am also pleased to welcome the Presidents of the national parliaments of Romania and Bulgaria, who join us in the public gallery ...
(The House rose and applauded the new Members)
Mr Olteanu, President of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, Mr Vacaroiu, President of the Romanian Senate and Mr Pirinski, President of the Bulgarian National Assembly, I welcome you too to the European Parliament.
We are now a grand assembly of 785 MEPs from 27 countries and - alarming as it may seem - 177 political parties.
In a few months' time, Romanians and Bulgarians will go to the polls to elect their European representatives.
From today, Parliament will do all it can to help make them aware of how important it is for them to take part in the first European elections to take place in Romania and Bulgaria.
I was recently able to see for myself just how enthusiastic Romanians and Bulgarians are about Europe.
I was made aware of this at the official ceremonies that took place in Bucharest on 31 December 2006 and in Sofia on 1 January 2007.
From both a personal and a political point of view, these were undoubtedly among the most memorable moments of my term of office, as well as being encouraging, given the Euroscepticism emerging in other capital cities.
I was able to see how proud Romanians and Bulgarians are to be European citizens now.
Everything of concern to them is now of much more concern to ourselves than it was before.
The case of the Bulgarian nurses condemned to death in Libya is now a European matter.
There needs to be no let-up in the EU's championing of these European citizens, and - without forgetting, either, the Palestinian doctor who is also condemned to death - I would take this opportunity again to call on the Libyan Government to take action on their behalf.
(Loud applause)
My fellow Members from Romania and Bulgaria, you bring with you your history, your culture and your faith in Europe.
You are bringing a new maritime dimension to the EU - that of the Black Sea - whose strategic importance we are all aware of at the present time, given that a good proportion of our energy resources pass through the Black Sea.
We are in the middle of a debate on energy policy, and your two countries' geographical location will undoubtedly do a great deal to enhance Europe's influence internationally.
You are giving us a closer view of people now less distant from us.
I am sure that, as citizens of two countries that share a border with the Western Balkans, you will make a decisive contribution to the Europe we are building.
With the accession of Romania, there are now four European Union countries that share a border with Ukraine and one that shares a border with Moldova, a state of affairs that can only enhance the European Neighbourhood Policy.
With Bulgaria's accession, there are now two countries that share a border with Turkey, and in this case too I am sure that Bulgaria's experience will be extremely useful to us.
Your countries and their peoples have made a huge effort to join the European Union.
It is an effort of which we are perhaps not sufficiently aware, but one that you have made.
What is more, you have a lot still to do.
As you are well aware, in November 2006 the European Parliament urged your governments not to slacken the pace of reform.
We believe that you are better placed to carry out the reforms from within, rather than from outside, the EU, and monitoring these will be a joint effort.
For all of us, the demanding task of getting to know each other begins today.
Ancient Tracia, Dacia and the like, which were part of Europe before our continent had a name, have rejoined the family and returned to the Europe to which they always belonged.
Their return will be as enriching as that of other parts of Europe on 1 May 2004.
We have major challenges before us, and I am certain that we shall work together to meet them.
You are welcome, then.
(Applause)
I now invite you to listen to the anthem of the European Union.
(The House rose and listened to the European anthem)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Monday, 18 December 2006.

Statement by the President
Before starting on the agenda, it is with a heavy heart that I have to remind you that the terrorist organisation, ETA has broken the ceasefire it had declared last March.
Its barbarous attack on Madrid airport has caused the deaths of two Ecuadoreans, Carlos Alonso Palate and Diego Armando Estacio, who, as immigrants, had found their place in Spanish society and so were able to support their families in Ecuador.
With this attack, ETA has put an end to the process that was initiated by the Spanish Government and that was debated in October 2006.
I should like, on behalf of the European Parliament, to express our most sincere sympathy and condolences to the families and friends of the two men who were murdered and to all Spaniards and Ecuadoreans.
I also want firmly to reiterate in this House the condemnation of this savage act of terrorism and to make it absolutely clear that, in a democracy, violence is wholly incompatible with dialogue and that peace,
(Applause)
coexistence in freedom and respect for human rights are non-negotiable.
I also want to reiterate our support for all of Spain's democratic institutions in that country's fight against ETA terrorism and to express the hope of all the European democracies that, sooner rather than later, Spaniards will put an end to violence throughout Spain.
I am going to ask you to observe a minute's silence for Carlos Alonso Palate and Diego Armando Estacio.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)

Formation of a political group
I would inform you of the creation of a new political group in the European Parliament, known as 'Identity, Traditions and Sovereignty'.
This group is composed of twenty Members from more than a fifth of the Member States and therefore fulfils the conditions laid down in the Rules of Procedure.
The composition of this group will be published in the Minutes of this part-session.
(DE) Mr President, I rise to speak further to Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure of this House, according to which it is a fundamental requirement, where a political parliamentary group is to be formed, that those who are to be its members share a political affinity.
I take it as read that the interview given by Mrs Mussolini to the APA news agency - or, at any rate, published by it - on 8 January cannot be seen as other than contrary to Rule 29, for, in it, she described the group - which was, at the time, yet to be set up - as technical rather than political, and indicated that there was much in this group's political programme that was not in line with her own thinking.
It follows, then, that the requirements of Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure have not been met, since technical groups - as we know from this House's history - are not permitted, and I therefore ask that the House's procedural committee be tasked with examining the legitimacy of this group's formation.
(Applause)
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Schulz, I understand your anger that a group, albeit one modest in size, has been set up on this occasion.
Your objection, Mr Schulz, would have some credence if all of our fellow Members had not signed an explicit declaration, which undeniably has political content and which the President and Parliament's administration have at their disposal.
I will be delighted to send you a copy.
This declaration is in favour of maintaining European identity and the identities of our countries in order to ensure that our modernity is rooted in European traditions. It is also in favour of financial transparency and includes non-confessional reference to Christian values and human rights.
It is a very precise text signed by all our Members.
As Mrs Mussolini said, we are also planning to bring an end to the somewhat discriminatory situation suffered by the Non-Attached Members by comparison with those MEPs who belong to a group. Unfortunately, this discrimination will continue for those who remain Non-Attached as they do not have the same political, administrative and financial resources as the other groups.
I must put your mind completely at rest, Mr Schulz: the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group most assuredly does have political content and complies entirely with Parliament's Rules of Procedure and the case law of the European Court of Justice.
Please, Mr Schulz, do not set yourself up as the bad guy seeking to bully a minority group and running the risk of censure by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
Mr Schulz, Mr Gollnisch, Rule 29, together with the footnote that clarifies the scope of its provisions, states that Parliament does not evaluate the political affinity of members of a group.
Only when any of the members concerned deny that they have the political affinity declared by the group is it necessary for Parliament to evaluate whether the group has been constituted in conformity with the Rules.
I do not believe that this is the case.
The group has made a declaration of principles or political statement.
This has been communicated to me, and it will be published in the Official Journal and signed by all the members of the group.
I believe that this is, for the moment, sufficient indication of political affinity between its members and I cannot therefore accede to your request, Mr Schulz.
Address by the President of Parliament
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I should like, if I may, to extend warm greetings to Romania and Bulgaria as new members of the European family and welcome the new MEPs from those two countries. This is their home now.
We have been working with the Bulgarian and Romanian observers since September 2005, and I feel sure that we will continue to work extremely well together in the years ahead.
As far as our group is concerned, these new accessions constitute a highly significant event.
The EU-27 must now face the great challenges of the future head on.
I trust it will do so in as unified and, most importantly, as responsible a way as possible.
One thing is for sure: the current Treaties no longer equip us sufficiently for meeting the new reality.
What we need, and the sooner the better, is new institutional rules of the game, without which Europe will not be in a position to resolve the major problems facing the continent.
Since your election, two and a half years ago, Mr President, Parliament has made great progress; the powers it now enjoys, the manner in which it performs its duties and its political maturity are clear for all to see.
To cite just two examples, the Services Directive and the REACH regulation on chemicals are two important cases in which Parliament has played a key role.
Another positive development is that relations with the Commission have become better defined with the new framework agreement.
I have no doubt, Mrs WallstrÃ¶m, that, like Parliament, the Commission will honour all its commitments in this regard.
Europe will only move forward if the European institutions, and in particular the Commission and Parliament, work in an atmosphere of mutual respect and positive cooperation.
Mr President, you have worked hard to strengthen dialogue between the European and national parliaments.
This is how we will succeed in convincing the citizens of the importance of action taken jointly by the EU Member States to address their day-to-day concerns.
We must step up this partnership and improve its structure.
The PPE-DE Group will propose strong initiatives to meet this objective.
During your term of office, Mr President, you have shown that Parliament is capable of functioning effectively with representatives of the 25 Member States, now 27, including the Bulgarian and Romanian observers.
In order for this to work even better in the future, you had the wisdom to propose parliamentary reform, which will also help us meet this objective from the moment it is adopted.
You have also succeeded, along with the Luxembourg Presidency, in overseeing the adoption of a Members' Statute, on which I congratulate you.
We are all aware that this was a particularly tough task that you had to accomplish.
Mr President - my dear Mr Borrell - you have been a President for all of us.
The PPE-DE Group placed its trust in you and you did not let us down.
You have always been open to requests made by Members of this House.
You have made sure that Parliament's voice has been heard loud and clear, not least in European Council meetings.
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I should like to thank you most warmly.
By way of a good luck message, I should like to borrow the words of Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca, who said, excuse my Spanish, 'Caminante, no hay camino. Se hace camino al andar.'
[Wanderer, there is no path. The path is made walking.]
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by joining in the congratulations to Mr Daul, who, I think, out of all the people in the plenary today, has taken on the most difficult job.
I wish him much success in leading the not entirely straightforward group whose chairman he has now become.
May your decisions, my dear Joseph, always be the right ones.
I welcome our new Members from Bulgaria and Romania.
We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fought like no other in this House for the 1 January 2007 deadline to be retained, for, where the restoration of our continent's unity in freedom, peace and - soon - undivided prosperity was concerned, we believed that the sooner it happened, the better.
Today is a good day, for, from now on, our Bulgarian and Romanian friends are officially of our number, and that is also a success for our group.
(Applause)
There are two reasons, as I see it, why it matters that I should say a word of thanks to you, Mr Borrell.
I shall start with a word of apology.
I have to apologise to you for all the unspeakable meetings of the Conference of Presidents, which you, in the chair, had to sit through and suffer through, enduring me and my temperament, which is, of course, notoriously equable, and which you attempted to keep within bounds as you watched over the proceedings.
You did not always get your way, and nor, for that matter, did I, so, speaking personally, I ask your indulgence for all the things I put you through.
I also, however, want to tell you, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that you made an extraordinarily dignified president for this Chamber.
Within Europe and outside it, you brought great dignity to representing Europe and earned much respect for so doing.
I was told by a member of the European Council that there is not one Head of State or Government who does not, at the councils of Heads of State or Government, listen attentively when Josep Borrell rises to speak, and there are two reasons for this, namely your personal dignity and the intelligent content of your speeches, to both of which, in equal measure, is attributable the fact that you were an outstanding representative of this freely-elected European institution.
We in the Socialist Group voted for you; many Members of this House put their trust in you, new and unknown as you were, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say, today, that you justified that trust in every way.
We, in the Socialist Group, rejoice that you are now returning to our ranks, to become, once more, an ordinary MEP.
Everyone who knows you, knows that that is what you will be - an ordinary and unpretentious Member of this House - for you are capable of exercising high office and then returning to the anonymity of the ranks.
It is that sort of personal modesty that is perhaps the distinguishing and outstanding characteristic of the personality that is Josep Borrell.
Many warm thanks, then, from me, on behalf of my group, for all that you have done for this House.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have to be honest: you were not my group's candidate in 2004.
We had proposed BronisÅaw Geremek, one of the fathers and architects of today's Europe of 27 Member States and a symbol of Europe's reunification.
But you have been fair and gentlemanly in your chairmanship of this House: you have treated its Members with courtesy and its business with patience and serenity.
As a newcomer to this Parliament, it is not easy to be asked to lead it, and you rose to the challenge.
Given the words of Mr Schulz, I wonder whether he fears for his own position should you return to his benches!
(Laughter)
Mr President, particularly I appreciate your commitment to engaging with our citizens.
You have invited many of us to join you in your work as an active European in your home country.
You have also shown commendable commitment and almost endless energy in promoting the European Union across the continent, and your mission in particular to Europe's young people has marked your work.
However, it has not been limited to the European Union: you have been an active President of this House beyond our shores in your promotion of the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, in your facilitation of the establishment of a Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly and beyond.
Nonetheless, I suspect that your greatest success during your presidency has been overseeing the successful integration of Bulgarian and Romanian Observers into this House.
The presence today of new Members signals the completion of the fifth enlargement of our Union.
The sight here today of two new Commissioners, Leonard Orban and Meglena Kuneva - at work since 1 January - warms our hearts, and the presence in the Council of Ministers of two new countries strengthens our Union as it prepares for an important birthday.
Mr President, your predecessor, Pat Cox, put much effort into modernising our House.
While recognising the reforms you have promoted, my group would have liked to have seen more reforms in the working of this House.
We know that you tried, only to find yourself bound, like Gulliver, at every turn by the bureaucracies of two political groups.
Their presence - the stubborn presence of the centuries - hangs heavy on our work.
Why should the European Parliament not meet formally every week to receive a report from the Commission?
Why should every Member not have a screen on their desks to bring us into the 21st century?
Why should our democracy be governed by rules laid down by a 19th century Belgian mathematician called D'Hondt?
These rules produce a result that is worked out on a calculator rather than a ballot paper, influenced more by the size and influence of nations than the European commitment and competence of the candidates.
It is something we must review if we are to reassert our democratic credibility in this, the 50th year since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, for if we fail to keep up with the times, public disillusion will grow.
The appeal of the abhorrent forces of knee-jerk nationalism on the far right may widen.
Therefore, I trust, Mr President, that your successors will engage with all Members of this House in a debate about the organisation of Parliament's affairs in order to preserve and develop the values which you have upheld so courageously in your term as President.
In closing, let me congratulate Mr Daul on his maiden speech as leader of his group.
We will no doubt hear far more from him in the years to come.
(Applause)
thar ceann an GhrÃºpa UEN. - A UachtarÃ¡in, is mÃ³r an onÃ³ir dom labhairt i mo theanga dhÃºchais anseo trÃ¡thnÃ³na inniu.
Ba mhaith buÃ­ochas Ã³ chroÃ­ a ghabhÃ¡il le rialtaisÃ­ uilig an Aontais Eorpaigh agus le FeisirÃ­ an tÃ­ seo as ucht a gcuid tacaÃ­ochta chun stÃ¡das oifigiÃºil oibre a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge.
TÃ¡ cur chun cinn teangacha rÃ­-thÃ¡bhachtach Ã³ thaobh forbairt iomlÃ¡n a dhÃ©anamh ar an Aontas Eorpach.
TÃ¡ ceangal lÃ¡idir idir Ã©agsÃºlacht chultÃºir agus comhoibriÃº eacnamaÃ­ochta san Eoraip agus creidim, a UachtarÃ¡in Borrell, gur Ã©irigh leat an dÃ¡ aidhm seo a bhaint amach le linn do thÃ©arma in oifig an UachtarÃ¡in.
It is a great honour and privilege for me to speak as Gaeilge - in my native tongue - for the first time within this Parliament.
I thank you, Mr President, and your services in particular and also the patience and resilience of Mr Priestley and his staff in making this happen on this occasion.
As we celebrate this historic occasion from an Irish perspective, we commemorate an even greater historic occasion with the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria.
I welcome my new colleagues as Members of Parliament, as equal, participating, voting and guiding Members of the European Parliament in 2007.
I congratulate them on their efforts to ensure that they could meet the criteria set down by the European institutions for them to be part of this wonderful process of peace, prosperity and stability.
Mr President, at the Conference of Presidents I have made my views clear to you with regard to my thanks and appreciation to you for every assistance that you have given to me, to Ireland and to people from Ireland who required assistance at institutional level.
Many of my colleagues have quoted different Spanish poets.
I can merely quote an old Irish poet who said: 'He came as a stranger and we saw fear, yet through his work, through his time, through his efforts, but most of all through his honesty, he became our friend and now we miss his passing, but most importantly of all, we walk in his footsteps for they lead us to greatness'.
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, too, I should like to welcome our fellow Members from Romania and Bulgaria and our new Commissioners.
I should also like to thank you, Mr President, for having given us the opportunity to listen to the European anthem again - it truly is the world's finest anthem, and it is always a very moving experience to hear it.
Starting from today, in good times and in bad, our problems, our aspirations and our objectives will also to some extent be yours, and your worries, weaknesses and objectives will also to some extent be ours.
We hope that, after accession, the difficult road to reform will continue, even though, unfortunately, I have to say that being a member of the European Union is not always a sufficient guarantee of stability and of any imbalances and problems being eliminated, as the example of some old and new countries - among which I must sadly mention my own - clearly demonstrates.
Mr President, I should like to thank you on behalf of my group, too.
You have given a summary in this House of the events of the last two and a half years, which I did not recall being so dense and, in some ways, so dramatic.
I wish to thank you on behalf of my group, even though you know that we did not support your election, for reasons that clearly have nothing to do with you as a person, but I specifically wanted to thank you because you have always done your best to make this Parliament a credible forum for debate and to spread its values of democracy and harmony throughout the world.
We often supported you precisely when two majority groups, which, unlike us, voted for you, left you somewhat in the lurch, for example when you wanted to make progress with the Constitution, with the financial perspective and with internal reforms, which sadly remain incomplete.
Today, you are relinquishing your role as President of the European Parliament; no doubt you will assume others, or sit alongside us here, in plenary.
Once again, I wish to thank you for your kindness and for your friendship and, if I may say so, also for your affability as a person.
Mr President, at the start of this parliamentary term, I gave the following response to your first speech, in which you set out the broad outlines of your Presidency: 'Your words', I said, 'reinforce our view that we can develop very constructive and cooperative relations with you.'
That is exactly how it has proved to be, and I thank you for a number of reasons.
I should first like to commend you for being a genuine progressive.
In spite of the constraints of your office and the particular conditions under which you exercised your mandate, you have succeeded in remaining true to our shared ideals.
Just a few days ago, in your speech to Humboldt University, you fiercely criticised the trend, and I quote, 'of letting social and fiscal competition develop between our countries, which leads to Europe coming across not as a constructive response to globalisation, but rather as a Trojan horse that undermines social connections.'
I share that view.
This type of convergence could, on its own, justify the view that we enjoy an excellent relationship.
There is another quality, however, that you have shown and that I should like to highlight.
Although they are close in certain areas, your political views do not coincide a great deal with those promoted by my group, and on some issues they are far apart, a case in point being the draft Constitutional Treaty.
Yet what we appreciate in you is your ability to listen to different points of view, even on a matter as tricky as this one.
It is not that you listen politely against a background of indifference; rather, you listen attentively against a background of respect for the speaker and, by extension, a desire to understand the speaker's motivations.
I am grateful to you for understanding the idea that one can be in favour of the European project whilst being staunchly opposed to a headlong commercial and financial rush forwards, and to the widespread competition that goes with it, which we call liberal Europe.
I repeat this today, the day on which we welcome our fellow Members from Romania and Bulgaria: if we want to haul ourselves out of the crisis of confidence - the crisis of common sense, even - afflicting Europe, we need to view the current model with a critical eye.
If we call for far-reaching changes, we do so in order that the citizens of our 27 countries might recognise that the Union is theirs.
Our criticism is therefore constructive, and I am grateful to you for understanding this.
When we take stock of a term of office of a President of Parliament, there is almost always a defining event or act that stands out, a landmark moment of some kind.
If I had to pinpoint that key point in your term of office I would say it was last summer as war was being waged against Palestine and Lebanon.
As all politicians should do in such a case, you clearly asked yourself: in my position, what can I do, however modestly, to oppose such an injustice?
Your response was to call all the group chairmen back from holiday to do something on Parliament's behalf that the EU-25, at their level, had proved incapable of doing, namely to call for, at the very least, an immediate cease-fire and a return to the rule of international law; you also called for talks to begin aimed at exchanging prisoners and for international negotiations to be held at the earliest opportunity on the basis of all the relevant UN resolutions on the Middle East.
Admittedly, we did not change the face of the world with our unanimous resolution, but we at least, thanks to you, saved Europe's honour.
For these reasons, Mr President, I thank you.
I hope that your future duties will enable us to pursue our excellent, fruitful cooperation.
(Applause)
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, bunÄ seara, Romania; ÐŽÐŸÐ±ÑÑ ÐŽÐµÐœ, Bulgaria; welcome, and let me, as the longest-serving Member, show you the House from the inside.
84 % of German laws come from Brussels - an alarming lack of democracy and a de facto suspension of the separation of powers, in the words of Roman Herzog, the former President of Germany.
Unfortunately, he is right.
If the EU had to apply for EU membership, it would be told, 'sorry, solve your democratic deficit first'.
The core of democracy is normally to hold elections, to have a new majority and then new laws.
This core can hardly be found here.
Therefore, Romanian and Bulgarian friends, you enter a Parliament with no vivid debates and a planned coronation of our next President.
Welcome to the waste of 22 working days, 50 extra hotel bills, EUR 250 million spent on the travelling circus between Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Brussels, and welcome to the 5 500 votes in a year where it is difficult to know exactly what you voted for.
The D'Hondt system will prevent you from having the most interesting posts and reports.
In your committees, young assistants and trainees from the Council will sit behind you with all the secret legislative documents you are not allowed to read.
The EU has more than 90 000 pages of law - red tape - which you can never amend as an elected Member of this Parliament.
To change anything, you need to go to someone who is not elected.
Of 480 million citizens, only the 27 non-elected Commissioners are allowed to put forward proposals for a new law or an amendment to an existing law.
In 2005, we decided more than 3000 different rules in the EU, applying codecision in only 57 cases.
Most rules are decided by civil servants in 300 secret working groups in the Council, prepared by another 3000 secret working groups in the Commission.
Dear new colleagues, welcome to a fight for transparency, proximity and democracy.
My welcome gift is this new orange handbook with a long list of victories for transparency and a longer list of current tasks.
Members from all groups and independents have prepared a 'fair chair' programme for our next President.
We could simply have one major seat, cut the travelling circus, introduce vivid debates, vote on major issues and change the D'Hondt system into a fairer system to avoid discrimination against smaller delegations in the big groups, against the smaller groups and against the independents.
One million citizens have signed a petition in favour of one place of work, and Mr Poettering will not even allow us to debate the one-seat petition.
It is a secret vote tomorrow; use your first vote at 10 o'clock to show your support for one seat and a fair chair.
(ES) Mr Borrell, tomorrow you will have the opportunity to change this system.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mr President, a President leaves, and a new group arrives - the Identity, Tradition and Sovereignty Group.
I should like to start by thanking the Romanian, Bulgarian, Flemish, Italian, Austrian, British and, of course, French patriots who have enabled us to set up this group. We expect to welcome other brave, clear-sighted MEPs.
I should also like to extend my personal congratulations to Mr Daul on his election.
With this group, we shall have greater visibility, resources and powers in this institution and we shall be the mouthpiece for the tens of millions of Europeans, 23 million according to my calculations, who would be without representation here in Parliament were it not for our group.
The national forces are the future of Europe, the true Europe, that of the people and of sovereign nations, that of identities and traditions, as indicated by our group name.
To give an example, in the past five years, three patriots have reached the final round in the presidential elections in their respective countries: Mr Siderov in Bulgaria, Mr Tudor in Romania and Mr Le Pen in France, and that is just the beginning.
This is indicative of our political significance in both Eastern and Western Europe.
I should like, if I may, Mr President, to commend you, at least at the end of your Presidency, for the fact that, although you may sometimes have been mislead by calumnies that were circulating about some of us, you made a perfectly correct interpretation of both the Rules of Procedure and the declaration that our group drew up, and that, in performing your duties as President, you resisted calls that I find appallingly totalitarian.
In what way, ladies and gentlemen, is it unusual that in a democracy, politicians come together to bring their ideas to the fore and to promote their opinions, on which the voters elected them and which they want to hear?
I am appalled by the kind of blurring of boundaries and collusion that goes on between the two major powers in this Chamber, which oppose one another in front of the voters, which present different manifestos and which appear to be rivals and competitors, whilst sharing the same view both on the appointment of a President and on the exclusion of some minority or other that does not share their dominant opinions.
A few words, Mr President, to take stock.
It is true that Parliament stood up to the Council and the Commission by making major changes to the Services Directive with the Gebhardt report, as well as to the REACH Directive.
I was dismayed that, in what is known as the institutional triangle, the appointment of the Italian Commissioner Mr Buttiglione was overturned. This episode was tantamount to an intellectual and moral witch-hunt, and was, in my view, unworthy of this House.
On the other hand, the majority in Parliament suffered several setbacks, in particular on the European Constitution, which was rejected by the French and Dutch people.
I hope that this rejection is taken on board.
What will happen in the second half of 2008 under the French Presidency, that is to say under what may be the Presidency of Mr Le Pen, as we all hope?
(Addressing Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit who had heckled him)
Yes, Mr Schulz, history has thrown up events more surprising than that.
Mr Cohn-Bendit, we have seen even you become an MEP.
What will Europe's energy policy be?
What will its immigration policy be?
What will Brussels' policy be as regards the liberalisation of public services?
We shall make our voice heard on these issues, of course, and on many others besides.
Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, rest assured, Mr President, we will be Parliament's bad conscience, its eagle-eyed critic, the unstinting defender of the European peoples and nations that made our continent and our civilisation great.
(Applause from the speaker's group)
- (SK) We have half of our term in office behind us, and for many of us this has been our first experience in high-level European politics.
It would be appropriate to stop and take stock, and perhaps evaluate what we wanted to achieve and what we have in fact managed to achieve.
If I look at the activities of the European Parliament, and the regulations, directives and recommendations we have adopted for Member States and their citizens, I can say that we have been working well, doing an effective job to the benefit of our voters.
However, in order to achieve favourable results, we must face up to the realities of the situation and see what it is we have failed to accomplish, or where we have been unable to meet our voters' expectations.
I think the main failing is the insufficient acceptance of the ten new Member States.
This is particularly apparent in our very poor representation in key positions, the small number of our citizens working in the European Commission and our almost zero representation in EU agencies, not to mention the fact that our citizens are appointed to the lowest positions.
I try to justify this situation by our lack of European-level experience.
This, however, is no longer true, and I hope that in the second half of the term the situation will be put right.
This is not a matter of boosting the profile of individuals, but primarily of accepting the ten new Member States as equal partners, not only with regard to their duties but also their rights.
We have set ourselves the great goal of becoming a global leader and prevailing in competition with major world players such as the USA and China.
However, the reality of the situation is quite different.
The European Union is unable to identify itself with the goals it has set.
We are marking time, and we are at a loss as regards the Constitutional Treaty, even though we know that its adoption would benefit us.
Competitiveness depends on our level of advancement in modern technologies, yet young scientists, doctors and engineers are leaving Europe every day, as they lack support here.
President Borrell, these are the last days of your presidency in the European Parliament.
Allow me to express my gratitude and respect for your work during what has been a challenging period, involving the accession of the ten new Member States.
You have handled many challenging situations with understanding and composure, and you have proved yourself willing to listen patiently to others.
I wish you much success in your professional and personal life.
This is a significant day for the European Union, not only due to the changing of the guard in key positions in the European Parliament, but also as the day on which the aims of the Treaty of Nice were fulfilled with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union.
This brings to an end a very important period of political change in Europe.
I know from my own experience what a long and exhausting wait it has been for this day to dawn.
Meeting accession criteria has also necessitated the adoption of tough and often unpopular measures.
We have thereby put an important period behind us.
Your participation in the European Parliament, however, will depend on having an active approach, and to this end the experience acquired by the ten new Member States over the previous period may prove helpful .
A warm welcome to everyone whose actions and intentions have been fair and sincere.
I wish you stamina, courage and success.
(ES) Mr President, allow me 30 seconds to point out that, as you relinquish the Presidency, only the Spanish MEPs of the People's Party refused to applaud you when all MEPs in this House were paying tribute to you.
As an MEP elected in Spain who did not vote for you either, I want to deplore this attitude, bringing as it does to this House a division whose origins lie elsewhere and that is affecting very much more serious issues.
I want publicly to deplore and to denounce this state of affairs and, like other fellow Members of other political persuasions, to congratulate you, notwithstanding the measure of disagreement between us, and to say how much I regret this attitude on the part of members of the Spanish People's Party, who have remained seated while the rest of the House stood to applaud you.
Thank you very much.
Regrettably, your words will not be recorded in the Minutes, because you have used a non-Community language, which I, for my part, have understood perfectly.
However, your purpose was, I am sure, not to have your comments recorded in the Minutes but to signal the warmth of your sentiments by using my maternal language, for which I am much obliged.
Mr President, the temperature in this Chamber definitely rose when our new colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria entered the Chamber, and they were helped by a proud and warm feeling.
However, we have also felt a rather chilling wind from nationalistic extremists and xenophobic forces that, unfortunately, exist throughout Europe.
(Applause)
This reminds us of the basic common task that we all have, despite party affiliations, to defend and deepen European democracy.
On behalf of the European Commission, I am honoured and pleased to issue a particularly heart-felt and warm welcome to the 53 new Members of the European Parliament from Bulgaria and Romania who join this Assembly today.
Bine aÅ£i venit, Romania!
ÐÐŸÐ±ÑÐµ ÐŽÐŸÑÐ»Ðž, Bulgaria!
Many of you have already participated in parliamentary proceedings as observers for more than one year now, and I am sure that you will quickly integrate into the fascinating rhythm of this House.
You contribute to the work and enrich the discussions and reflections with the political groups, the committees and also here in plenary.
The Commission and its services look forward very much to working together with you.
We, the representatives of the European Union's institutions, have an enormous responsibility vis-Ã -vis the people in Romania and Bulgaria and their hopes for the future.
We must do our utmost to live up to their expectations and to prove that their belief in European integration will bear fruit and make Europe stronger as a whole.
Your role as parliamentarians is crucial in making your countries' membership a success, and communication is key to everything.
Therefore, please go local and talk to your constituents, listen to your citizens and show them how you can take their views and concerns into account.
Take your time to explain to them how Europe works and how our policies affect their everyday lives, and try to give people a realistic picture of what Europe means and why being a European matters.
The first of January this year was a truly historic moment for all of us, not only for you, the 53 new Members of the European Parliament, who finally saw your countries join the European family, but also for all of us, because the accession of Bulgaria and Romania completed the fifth enlargement of the European Union, which has contributed to peace, prosperity, stability and democracy throughout Europe.
Let me now turn to you, President Borrell Fontelles.
During this legislature, you have played a significant role in ensuring the smooth integration of the 162 Members from the 10 new Member States into the working procedures of the European Parliament.
You have also helped the Romanian and Bulgarian observers find their way and feel at ease both in Brussels and Strasbourg.
In the name of President Barroso and the whole Commission, I would like to thank you for the excellent cooperation our two institutions have had under your presidency, starting with the renegotiation and updating of the framework agreement, and also for your very strong personal commitment, your strong political commitment and tireless efforts to increase the responsibilities of this House to move our common European project forward and to defend our shared values.
Whether it has been your important role in finding an agreement on the financial perspective, as chairman of the temporary committee, your personal initiative to reform the working methods of the European Parliament or your visits to third countries, where you relentlessly pleaded the cause of pluralism and democracy, you have left a crucial fingerprint on this House.
You will pass on to your successor an assembly which, in the past two and a half years, has successfully demonstrated that it is a reliable and competent partner and which assumed its role as co-legislator with responsibility and authority, be it when finding a compromise on the Services Directive or when the institutions negotiated the important agreement on new chemicals legislation.
In your inaugural speech in 2004, you said that, as President of the European Parliament, your passion for democracy would now be united with your passion for Europe.
On a personal note, let me say that I hope that this marriage of passions will continue for many more years.
Let me also say, on a very personal note, how proud I was to be with you on several occasions when we met with young people and how impressed I was by the way you handled those situations.
Like everybody else, I have also taken Spanish lessons with varied results, so I would like to say:
(ES) Thank you for everything, and I wish you good luck in performing your new tasks.

Opening of the sitting
(The sitting was opened at 10.05 a.m.)
President. In accordance with the Act relating to the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, I declare the session open.
This is the second time that, quite undeservedly, I have had the honour of presiding over the election of the President of the European Parliament.
It will, of course, be the President who delivers a keynote speech.
The applause with which we welcomed the new Member States (Bulgaria and Romania) yesterday and the warm tribute paid to Mr Borrell are signs of trust and continuity.
In a few weeks' time, it will be the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which marks the birth of the European family, a newcomer to the international political and economic scene.
We will proudly celebrate it:
because of the extraordinary 60 years of practically uninterrupted peace on our continent;
because of our shared values: freedom, democracy and social justice; and
because of the hopes that political Europe has inspired in many parts of the world.
It is only by looking ahead that we can respond to these expectations, to the demands and also to the criticisms of Europeans on institutional and social issues.
I am referring to a globalised world, to the progress it has made and to the ever-growing injustice within it.
I am referring to the great responsibility that we have towards the future of energy and the environment, that is to say, towards the survival of the planet and towards future generations.
I am referring to new opportunities linked to developments in science, to the way in which the applications of these developments are managed, and to the advantages and ethical dilemmas that arise in everyone's minds and that mean making informed decisions.
Announcement of the candidates for election to the office of President
I would remind you that the election of the President will begin at 10 a.m. and I would point out that, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 11(2) of the Rules of Procedure, no business shall be transacted while the oldest Member is in the Chair unless it is concerned with the election of the President or the verification of credentials.
I would also remind you that, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament must be submitted with the consent of the nominees and that they may only be made by a political group or by at least 40 Members.
Under the conditions laid down by the Rules of Procedure, I have received the following nominations for the presidency of the European Parliament:
Mr Jens-Peter Bonde
Mrs Monica Frassoni
Mr Hans-Gert Poettering
Mr Francis Wurtz
The candidates have stated that they accept their respective nominations.
I would also point out that, in accordance with Rule 13(1), a candidate must obtain an absolute majority of the votes cast in the first three ballots in order to be elected.
Blank and invalid ballot papers will not be considered when counting the votes.
(The President proceeded to draw the tellers)
The following Members are appointed as tellers:
Mrs Ãsa Westlund
Mrs Edit Herczog
Mr Mogens N.J. Camre
Mrs Jamila Madeira
Mr Ioannis Kasoulides
Mr Thomas Wise
Mrs Gitte Seeberg
Mr Dariusz Rosati
I shall now appoint the tellers to the various ballot boxes, selected in alphabetical order.
Before proceeding to the vote, I shall give the floor to each of the four candidates for a speech which, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, must not exceed five minutes.
Mr President, dear colleagues, since 2004, we have known that Mr Poettering would be our next President, but we can still avoid a coronation.
Today's vote is a secret ballot.
May I urge every colleague to use his or her vote in the first round to show Mr Poettering our urgent need for reforms.
Concerning the issue of one seat, at the next meeting of the Conference of Presidents our new President should propose an early debate on our seats and our calendar for 2008.
We could simply decide to meet in the town where the Commission is meeting, not mentioning Brussels or Strasbourg, and then invite the Commission President and relevant Commissioners to explain their proposals from the same day's meeting and to receive our political comments.
This is how a real parliament works.
Then we could have one fixed hour of well-organised voting in all areas of joint decision-making, allowing us to reach the magic 393 votes behind our amendments.
After the French presidential elections in May, we could then invite the new President of France and the Prime Ministers of Belgium and Luxembourg to a debate on a lasting solution for all seats.
Concerning voting, our new President should refuse any voting that is not properly prepared by the committees.
We must vote on real political differences, not on technicalities.
Last year we had 5 500 votes in which very few Members can say what they voted on.
As regards better legislation, Parliament has a real influence in the conciliation committees, but we are badly organised for that.
We need qualified legislative experts in all fields in order to balance the Commission.
We need to focus on legislation, instead of wasting hours on debate in areas where Parliament has no say.
On the allocation of rapporteurships and posts, we need to be more flexible in order to allow personal qualifications to be taken into account.
The D'Hondt system is simply too rigid.
Why not use the Sainte-LaguÃ« method instead?
It is also a proportional system, but it allows both the smaller delegations in the big groups - that is, the majority of the Members - and the smallest groups and independents to have more interesting first choices.
On the faÃ§ades of our buildings here in Strasbourg, they still campaign for a 'Yes' to a Constitution that was rejected by the French and Dutch voters.
The buildings do not belong to a propaganda ministry; this is a parliament.
Parliament makes decisions, but it should hold no view as an institution.
There are majorities and minorities, but all views are equal and all Members are equal, so, please, order your staff to clean the House of institutional propaganda in support of specific views.
On representation abroad, so far, Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs has sent 58 representatives to negotiate the Constitution with the national parliaments.
Of these, 54 were in favour of the Constitution and only 4 were against.
In 7 of 11 meetings, the 'No' side was not even represented at all.
These figures do not proportionately represent the 137 Members who voted 'No' to the Constitution.
Our new President must safeguard fair representation of different views when we are represented abroad.
There must be equal opportunities for the 'Yes' and 'No' sides when we resume the constitutional process under the German Presidency.
A democracy is also judged by how it treats its minorities.
As regards staff policy, most leading administrative posts are now divided between the two big groups.
Our next President should propose a new system for the future and immediately order all staff to cut their special links to their parties.
All staff must be politically impartial and serve Members equally.
On the President's own position, our next President could establish a 'new' old tradition.
Why not stop taking part in political group meetings and visible voting, and show us that our next President is the dedicated president for all of us?
Why not introduce this good old practice from the first parliament in the world, the Westminster Parliament?
Finally, I would like to welcome Mr Joseph Daul as the new leader of the PPE-DE Group.
