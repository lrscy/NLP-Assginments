We await with keen anticipation the Commission's proposals to reduce emissions from the transport sector.
Of course, we might have secured more, but speed is of the essence.
We want this scheme to succeed, and if Member States are to start meeting their targets they must publish national allocation plans by March 2004.
Several Member States have expressed serious concern about this legislation and this has been reflected within all our political groups.
All those leading on the issue have faced a degree of resistance from some colleagues, but it is a tribute to the skill of our rapporteur that we have secured all-party support for this package.
It is also a reflection of our shared concerns.
When the Commissioner reflects on her term in office, she can take particular pride in the role she personally, and her team, played in securing support for the Kyoto Protocol.
But with emissions of greenhouse gases continuing to increase in most developed countries, we hope that this scheme can make a very significant difference.
I hope that it will enable the European Union to retain its credibility as the world's leading force in pressing for action to curb global warming.
I hope also that it will send out a very clear signal about our determination, both to the United States and to Russia - particularly to Russia - whose ratification of the Protocol is so important.
Mr President, Commissioner, emission allowances are not naturally occurring phenomena and they have not been the result of human labour.
They represent an administratively allocated abstract right to pollute the atmosphere.
Emissions trading is not a market mechanism.
It serves to reallocate emissions among the polluters, but not reduce them.
The most despicable way of allocating emissions is by auctioning them.
Things could easily turn out the way they did when the radio spectra were auctioned off: the air space was bought and sold and all the operators ran into trouble.
We must not let that happen to European industry.
As the system covers just carbon dioxide emissions it will be free to release other pollutants into the atmosphere.
There are many questions the directive does not answer.
I will mention some of them.
The emission allowances are to be sold on the stock market.
Should an emission allowance, as a financial instrument, be regarded as being the equivalent of a share or an option?
How will its sale or non-sale be taxed?
How will emissions be recorded in company balance sheets?
How will they be treated with regard to private individuals' income and wealth taxation?
Indeed, will private individuals also be able to buy them?
We need to ask whether the EU will generally have the power to decide all these matters in a way that treats everyone in the same harmonised way.
Emissions trading will be done on the stock market and stock exchange activity always involves speculation.
There is a danger that the price of an emission allowance will be determined by speculators having no links with industry or any other source of emissions production.
Then industry in the Member States might fall victim to the mechanism proposed by the United States of America, in which US industry is not involved and profits and losses depend crucially on the first administrative allocation of emission allowances.
The Directive on emissions trading is a raw fruit, which should have been allowed to ripen longer.
There are many Members in our group who do not believe in the trading of emission allowances on the stock market.
Many Members, however, will vote in favour of the compromise amendments, because they are better than Parliament's report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all my congratulations to Mr Moreira da Silva.
This is a very important directive, perhaps the most important one of these five years, and tomorrow it will be brought to a successful conclusion.
The opt out that Germany was so keen to see for entire sectors is explicitly no longer possible.
A heavy defeat for the Ministry for Economic Affairs and even for Chancellor SchrÃ¶der.
Still more important is that next year the Commission will study seriously how transport sectors, with stress on the plural, can be brought under this directive.
And that is most sorely needed.
Both road traffic and air traffic are going too far.
All the internal air traffic within Europe will count for the achievement of the 8% reduction.
Can the Commission confirm that it is working on a concrete proposal to bring air traffic within Europe under this directive?
It is very important that we conclude tomorrow because that, as Mr Davies has already said, will give the right signal to both the Duma in Russia and the government and the opposition in the United States that this is a serious system.
This is the most efficient way of reducing CO2 and I do not therefore understand the GUE Group.
May I start by warmly congratulating not only Mr Moreira da Silva, but also the Commissioner and her officials, who really have pulled out all the stops to produce a good proposal.
This was an extremely controversial proposal.
There has been much weighing up of the pros and cons in many a European boardroom, in many Member States and therefore within the political groups as well.
How will this impact on our business?
What will the options be for new investments in production capacity?
What will an expansion cost if we have to purchase rights?
And finally, what will the consequences be for the competitiveness of industries that are already finding it difficult, such as the refining industry, the chemical industry and the iron and steel industry?
Mr President, what we seemed almost to have forgotten in the discussions was that we were all there when agreements were made in Kyoto and that this directive on emission trading was simply a good way of ensuring that the reduction tasks could be implemented in a very efficient manner.
That was the underlying intention of this proposal. In other words, how to use an economic tool to serve the environment.
Trading in what one business has too much of and another too little.
The path to the compromise, which I otherwise support, was not an easy one.
The economic interests for European industry as a whole were great and a European approach to the problem therefore went without saying.
At the same time we had to put on record that a European approach was also very difficult because there were such great differences in starting positions, not only because the environment has been rather better implemented in one Member State than another, but also because the objectives of the Member States were so different.
Yet something good came out of it.
The political compromise takes the existing differences into account.
Agreements have been made for benchmarking and I am very happy with them, likewise with the Commission's control of them.
It has also been agreed that the auctioning, in any event for the first but also for the second period, is allowed but is not compulsory.
Mr President, I appreciate what has been achieved, especially the benchmarking, and for that I thank my fellow Members, in particular Mr Blokland, and once again the rapporteur.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is taking us down a new road.
Until now, we had used direct taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, and we could have done that here by specifying CO2 threshold values for certain types of plant.
Rather than do that, we have opted for indirect taxation via pricing, and, as one finds with indirect taxation, here too, our problem is that it sets off many side-effects that we had not initially wanted.
That being so, Commissioner, it is the Commission's particular responsibility to take matters in hand as regards any such side-effects.
I will mention just three of them.
The first is that emissions trading may of course have an effect on enterprises' balance sheets and end up being a factor in their shutting down production or moving it elsewhere.
That has nothing more to do with the protection of the environment; it would be a purely commercial calculation.
This is where, as a principle, climate protection must, without doubt, be given priority over factory closures and the transfer of production.
The second question, Commissioner, is whether there are safeguards ensuring that emissions rights are indeed issued for the sake of climate protection and not as part of individual Member States' policies on industry.
One of your core responsibilities is to check to see that they are issued in accordance with fair criteria and with the aim of reducing greenhouse gases that affect climate.
Thirdly, might it not also be the case that advantages in terms of comparative costs will lead to the indirect promotion of atomic energy?
Here too, it is for the Commission to take responsibility for ensuring that no indirect impact is envisaged here.
I hope that you will have plenty of staff and plenty of courage to enable you, in the interests of workers, to discharge that responsibility.
Mr President, as our colleague, Mr SeppÃ€nen, said, our group is no supporter of the trade in emissions allowances, because we believe it may contribute to the imbalance between rich and poor countries, but we Members on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do support Mr Moreira da Silva's proposal, because it tries to establish stricter controls on this trade, restoring some of the amendments from first reading, which we believe to be important.
Despite this lack of enthusiasm, I hope that the rapporteur is right when he says that this trade will correct the situation of non-compliance on the part of the majority of Member States - my own country is perhaps one of the worst offenders - and contribute to teaching European companies in preparation for 2008 when the international trade comes into effect, and, most importantly of all, may convince the United States to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
We agree with the rapporteur on the need to include the six greenhouse gases, although the common position only establishes that, as of 2008, the Member States will be able to request their unilateral inclusion in the allowance trading system.
We believe it to be important that projects which relate to the mechanism for clean development and joint application should not be a replacement for prioritising emissions reductions, which must be achieved within the European Union.
In any event, the common position includes certain proposals from the European Parliament which we believe to be very important, such as, for example, the demand for greater transparency in the registers, in relation to the ownership of transfer and the cancellation of allowances, the obligation to publish the names of non-compliant operators and penalties imposed for non-compliance, which are now fixed.
Mr President, Commissioner, the vital importance of this directive in environmental and economic terms is clear.
The European market in emissions allowances will provide the Member States with an effective instrument within their climate change policies to close the gap between the true situation in the field of polluting emissions and compliance with the Kyoto commitments, while creating the best possible cost-benefit relationship.
The political importance of this directive is perhaps less obvious, but no less significant.
European environmental policy is moving on from words to actions, from rules and principles to practice, linking the economy to the environment.
This always creates uncertainty, resistance to change, apparent winners and losers and there is no doubt that this can be argued over, but I believe there are many more arguments to convince us, and to convince us that we are moving in the right direction, and to confirm that Europe, by means of directives such as this, is consolidating its determination to lead the process of achieving sustainable development.
In this case we must thank the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva, for the excellent work he has done.
He has achieved agreements between positions which were initially very far apart and in the end we are going to avoid the need for conciliation by reaching an agreement with the Council which is satisfactory to both sides.
Personally, as he knows, I have been very critical and I have been a great nuisance to him over some of the amendments approved at first and second readings, above all those which seemed to me to impose excessively rigid conditions on the Member States for the application of the directive and which made it difficult for each State to find and define the best way to fulfil its objectives.
However, this agreement, which has been reached following long and difficult negotiations inside and outside Parliament and the Council, has lead to a much more open text, which is no less effective and is acceptable to everyone.
We needed a directive which was sufficiently flexible to allow the Member States to be able to adapt their requirements and operation to the characteristics of their national policies.
I believe it was a complicated task which has been successful.
Mr Moreira, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to congratulate you and take pleasure in having been able to successfully take such an important step towards practice in the environmental field.
Mr President, I would sincerely like to acknowledge all those who have been involved in creating this compromise, which we will vote on tomorrow.
It has been said several times here that after the first reading it was difficult to believe that we would get this far, that we would have a directive on emissions trading available to us whose content is sensible and rational in a way that makes it possible to be accepted from very different points of view.
We obviously have to remember that this is just one of the many ways we have to aim for a reduction in greenhouse gases.
If this way were not available to us, we would have to find another, but it has been seen and shown that this is a cost-effective scheme and in this sense it is good that it is to be introduced.
I wish to stress, however, that these last minute discussions and negotiations resulted in the unreasonable proposals that seemed to be included, such as a ceiling on national emission allowances, being taken out.
Moreover, the fact that auctioning is to be voluntary is excellent.
This way companies that have opted in will not be under strain.
In conclusion, my congratulations go to the rapporteur and all the others involved.
We still have a long road ahead of us in our endeavours to reach the Kyoto targets, but the compromises this report and this directive have achieved mean that we are a step further along the way.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my warm thanks to Mr Jorge Moreira as rapporteur.
He has fought with much energy, determination and expertise for a good and practical system of greenhouse gas emissions trading.
I would also like to thank the Commission for its strong support for such a system, but I have to be perfectly honest and say that I am disappointed with the Council.
I think we would have achieved more and could have got a better system if the Council and my own government in particular had been more constructive.
Unfortunately, some Member States, Germany among them, tried for a long time to torpedo the whole system and weaken it.
The upshot is that the compromise we now have is not as good as it might have been if everyone had sought a constructive solution from the outset.
I think some problems are inevitable unless great care is now taken with national implementation and monitoring by the Commission.
The aim of the system is to cut the costs of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and - much more important - to create an incentive for undertakings to develop new ways of saving energy and greenhouse gases.
Market economics is a powerful system; it is capable of opening up potential, if only we set the right conditions.
Market economics should also therefore be brought to bear on environmental protection, which is what this system seeks to do.
As I said, the Commission and the Member States now carry a heavy responsibility for implementation because the compromise is not as precise as Jorge Moreira and Parliament as a whole would have liked, but was watered down somewhat by the Council.
Now, some risk of over-allocation still remains and the Commission will have to watch things very carefully; there is also still a risk of allocations being made that have no regard for the technical possibilities.
We all know that coal can very easily be replaced by gas or other energy sources, but it is not so easy to cut CO2 emissions for lime, cement and steel.
That must be taken into account when allowances are allocated, otherwise it will not be fair.
Mr President, it was quite remarkable how the Commission and Parliament were able to reach a tidy compromise under the providential leadership of the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva.
I think it is also an expression of European identity, because climate policy has a good name in Europe.
May it continue to do so.
When it comes to emissions trading, we must be careful not to confuse two things.
Trading in emissions does not save one tonne of CO2; that is only saved by investment.
But emissions trading encourages investment, that is to say it triggers a search for the cheapest way of cutting CO2.
It is also sensible from an economic point of view and industry and many government leaders, many of whom still find emissions trading strange, need to see that.
Secondly, Mr SeppÃ€nen - and, to some extent, Mr Lange as well - have rightly pointed out that a few questions are still unanswered.
For example, are emissions rights securities?
How are they treated?
These are questions for which an answer will probably have to be found in the future, at either national or European level.
As regards cost factors for undertakings, Mr Lange is quite right to say that undertakings' balance sheets will probably look different in future than they do today, especially if CO2 costs more than it does today.
Today it costs EUR 5 to EUR 6 a tonne.
Once it costs EUR 20 to 30 a tonne, the picture will be quite different and will naturally have effects on energy policy.
Let us hope that these will be the ones we are looking for, namely cuts in CO2.
Mr President, the unanimous sign-off of this emissions trading directive in December 2002 at the Council of Ministers was a major wake-up call to corporate Europe and a signal that this was actually going to happen.
Quite frankly, I do not think they believed it up to that point.
I extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, my colleague, Mr Moreira Da Silva, for the enormous body of work that he did in bringing all of us to where we are today.
Ireland has one of the worst records, second only to Spain, for greenhouse gas emissions.
National emissions allowance capping will ensure that quantifiable Kyoto objectives are met and that we decouple economic growth from increased greenhouse gas emissions.
National allocations will have to be linearly convergent with the Kyoto Protocol.
The national cap on allowances can start from the 2003 emissions level and not from that of 1990, provided that the allowances are decreased to the Kyoto figure by 2012.
Amendment No 43 is very important as it allows Member States to benchmark the best available technology for allowance allocation.
This should ensure that one-off, economically-vital industries can be looked after in a Member State.
The force majeure provision is also necessary until a liquid trading market emerges.
It is critical to secure the viability of the emissions trading market in the short term if it is to survive in the longer term.
In particular, a situation where, as a result of market design, allowance prices significantly exceeded the long-run marginal cost of abatement within the EU and approached the penalty price would be unsustainable.
It is appropriate that provisions be made to deal with unforeseen circumstances during the pilot period of 2005 to 2007.
In the absence of market management mechanisms and taking into account the risks involved, the current force majeure clause could provide flexibility for Member States to cope with unforeseen events such as market failure, and avoid serious economic shocks.
Definition by the Commission of the circumstances under which it may be applied is appropriate and desirable for Member States in advance of them preparing their national allocation plans.
In conclusion, the provision for banking 2005 to 2007 surplus allowances into the 2008 to 2012 period effectively reduces the number of allowances available for allocation in that period and will act as a constraint on Member States in applying force majeure.
Nonetheless, given the large uncertainties and the major risks involved, the provision for force majeure must be retained.
Mr President, it is hard to imagine any other report that would have so great an impact on the state of things in Europe and about which the decision-makers know so little.
Europe is now moving into unfamiliar territory.
Even theoretical research on the effects of emissions trading exists in name only.
When two or three years ago we had the Commission proposal before us, it started to become clear how enormous the gaps were in the proposal upon which we had been building a European strategy for the economy, competition and the environment.
There was no appraisal made of the impact of enlargement, no guidance given about how emission allowances could be accounted for in companies' books, no information regarding value added tax, not even a strategy in case of serious market problems or speculative attacks, no precise data on emissions in Member States, let alone emissions in companies, and no proposal regarding rights of appeal.
It is regrettable that we had such an incomplete proposal on such a major issue.
Much has been done to put things right, but whether or not we succeeded remains to be seen.
The 'trendline cap' problem in Trilog was solved with a formulation proposed by the Commission that allows Member States to approach the Kyoto targets along their own paths.
In being allowed room to move, Member States are also being encouraged to embrace a transport policy that is more responsible in terms of the Kyoto Agreement.
That of course is our real problem.
Trilog's solution for project-based mechanisms should also be supported.
There is no sense in setting more stringent criteria than was agreed at Marrakech.
We need, rather, to establish EU rules concerning how converting the emission allowance credits earned from project-based mechanisms into marketable emission allowances can take place without the climate change imperative being compromised.
The emission allowance credits earned from the project-based mechanisms will also have an interesting impact on development cooperation.
I believe Member States will become much more interested in development cooperation, because they will see the chance to earn emission allowance credits with projects.
Combined heat and power production and process emissions posed a special problem in connection with emissions trading.
If the causal chain associated with the nature of CHP is not taken into account, there will not be any reductions in emissions either.
Now Trilog is discovering and acknowledging the special nature of CHP.
Member States can take the potential for a reduction in process emissions into account, which in practice means that the best European steel factories can earn their full emission allowance quotas and they will not have to bear additional costs in a world steel market that has been fiercely competitive.
That means the risk of carbon leaks will diminish and there really will be an increased chance of preventing climate change.
. Mr President, firstly, I am totally convinced that the issue of climate change will follow not only us but generations to come, and it will become more and more difficult and we will have to be more and more ambitious in order to meet this enormous challenge to human life on this planet.
This issue will not go away and we will have to deal with it and find solutions.
I am also convinced that we will need all the different tools we can find: legislation, as well as voluntary agreements and market-based instruments, like this one.
That is also why it is important that we take the initiative and try this out.
We have studied carefully the experience already gained with sulphur trading in the US and we have conducted studies.
We have also prepared in a prudent way the start of an emissions trading system in Europe.
I shall just comment on two things that were mentioned.
Firstly, the treatment of allowances.
Allowances will be a tradable commodity, just like many other tradable commodities, and it is not different just because it stems from an environmental policy.
It will be subject to existing taxation legislation in the Union - not different from any other area.
On transport, we wanted to start with large, fixed-point installations, whose emissions can be feasibly monitored.
The transport sector consists of many small diffuse sources that we thought would be difficult to monitor, administer and control.
This has been important in designing this proposal, but we accept that transport also has to be subject of action when it comes to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions.
We are happy to look at how this area can also be covered.
This is now part of this compromise package.
Under the text of the directive, the Commission is committed to researching how the transport sector could be brought into the scheme.
We will also come back on other issues, as you know, which are in the pipeline to link them to joint implementation and the other flexible mechanisms as well.
We will also come back on these issues.
Mr President, I have asked the Commission in Dutch and in English whether it will include aeroplanes in this.
It can be easily measured using data from only a few take-offs.
Commissioner, can you answer 'yes' or 'no' as to whether you intend to do this?
Could you please answer this question?
. Mr President, in answer to that question, of course we will see what we can do on air transport also, but we do not have any ready-made plans.
As you know we are trying to work in international fora to address this problem.
It is already a part of the discussion under the Kyoto Protocol and we will now have to follow up and see what we can do in order to address the whole transport sector.
Of course we will also have to look at what it is possible to do regarding air transport.
We do not have any ready-made proposals or a set date which we can present to you.
However, we will do our best to also address air transport.
Thank you very much for that additional information.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Mr Lannoye and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on water and proteins added to chicken meat (O-0045/2003 - B5-0099/2003).
. (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite the lateness of the hour there is a problem we would like to broach.
This is what we tend to think of in Dutch as 'bloated chickens'.
It is currently legal to fill chickens with water. It is possible to add 30%, 40%, 55% water to these chickens.
The problem is that to keep them looking a little like chickens proteins are then added to these chickens, proteins from offal, from chicken meat that is supplemented with pig proteins and with cow proteins.
This happens in particular in Dutch companies and this chicken meat, if you can still call it chicken meat, is then sold in the UK as Halal to the Muslims and Kosher to the Jews.
This is unacceptable and this was emphasised in a BBC documentary.
I know that the Commission will propose labelling: 'chicken with pork' or 'chicken with beef'.
But the problem is that with modern DNA techniques it is very easy to rub out the DNA of these chickens, the DNA of this beef and pork so that the British are unable to prove that it contains anything other than chicken.
We therefore propose simply banning it: no water may be added to this chicken.
The UK Food Standards Agency has proposed the addition of no more than 15% water.
What is your response to this?
. Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Lucas, Mr Lannoye and Mr de Roo for tabling a question on adding water and protein to chicken meat.
In May 2002 the Irish and British authorities published the first worrying results of their investigations concerning chicken breasts imported from the Netherlands and intended for the catering industry.
The results published by the same authorities on 12 May 2003, show that the problem remains.
The practice of artificially increasing the weight of meat by the addition of protein and water - in some cases up to 40% or 50% water in the final product - in order to mislead the purchaser is despicable.
It appears that purchasers and, by association, consumers are being misled on three counts.
First, the labelling of the product may lead to the assumption that it is fresh poultry meat, when it is clearly not.
Second, some products have been labelled as Halal despite containing pig as well as other animal proteins.
Third, the meat contents expressed have been overstated.
Enforcement and possible sanctions arising from the infringements of legislation relating to the labelling of foodstuffs and unfair practices are the responsibility of Member States.
According to the information transmitted by the Irish and British authorities, the chicken products concerned are in the main manufactured in the Netherlands.
That does not mean that there is no other country concerned with this issue.
I have asked Member States to strengthen their controls and reinforce their cooperation.
Fraud appears when you are looking for fraud.
As regards the letter from the Dutch authorities of July 2002, I have, along with my colleague Commissioner Fischler requested more information from the Dutch authorities about the measures taken and the origin of the protein.
In March of this year the Dutch authorities undertook to ensure that these products were correctly labelled.
However, inspection results from the UK and Irish authorities indicate that the problem of fraudulent labelling continues to exist.
I have therefore asked the Member States to improve collaboration between national authorities and to strengthen the controls.
Furthermore, I have decided that there is a need to improve the labelling requirements for chicken and other meat preparations.
The Commission will propose to Member States in the food chain committee to include an explicit mention, for instance, of chicken preparation with added water, on the food label.
The standing committee on the food chain and animal health composed of representatives of Member States welcomed this suggestion at its meeting on 8 April 2003.
The technical discussion will continue during the next committee meetings.
I have also asked my services to consider the development of standards for meat preparations that would limit the amount of water that can be added to such products and the use of animal proteins for the purpose of bulking.
Your suggestion to indicate chicken meat containing beef or chicken meat containing pig is one that will be examined along with the possibility of banning the use of such proteins in poultry meat preparations.
As regards the detection of the addition of pork or beef protein following enzymatic treatment to destroy the DNA, this will be examined by the Commission Services with the experts from the Member States.
In addition, it is important to emphasise that other control methods, including documentary checks, should be used to check the origin and traceability of products.
Mr President, I associate myself with everything Mr de Roo has said, and his outrage at these events is shared by many in the United Kingdom, which is the principal destination for these adulterated products.
I would like to press the Commissioner further.
Since chicken at the moment can be legally sold when it is 55% water and is adulterated by other proteins which the perpetrators of this scam boast is PCR negative and, therefore, cannot be detected by most tests, is it not the case that there should be a more direct form of action from the Commission?
The FSA in Britain has now proposed, through Sir John Krebs, its chairman, that we should set a limit of 15% for the water content of what is labelled and sold as chicken.
He has further said that at that level the addition of these proteins - which intended to sustain the holding capacity of a much larger proportion of water - would therefore become unnecessary.
It is still the case, however, that many of those who are at the moment exporting these tainted products will continue to attempt to evade legal provisions and checks.
I would like to hear from the Commission that it will intervene not merely by recommending better labelling and better testing - though, of course, we need that - but by taking action to outlaw these activities, which are a total fraud on the public and are likely in one respect to cause serious concern, because the injection of beef protein - which the perpetrators admit has come from countries where there is BSE, and they have not tested the products for that - may cause serious public concern as well.
This is a matter that has outraged the United Kingdom and many others.
We need improved testing, but we need direct intervention here from the Commission, and I am confident that we will get it.
Mr President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that this has gone on for far too long.
I welcome the question, but what I would welcome even more is a promise of clear legislative action.
In fact, as far as the Trading Standards Officers in my home city of Hull are concerned, this has been a running campaign against chicken cheats for over six years.
That is long enough.
During the last of those years I have had correspondence and contact on their behalf, both with our national authorities and with the Commissioner's bureau.
Now, of course, recent publicity has highlighted the problem with chicken, but this deception is not confined to chicken - adulteration of other meats, particularly ham, is commonplace.
This entire practice of adding water and, therefore, also other animal proteins to meats is misleading, deceptive and downright immoral in respect of its impact on some religious communities.
Whilst labelling might be one possible improvement, my understanding, as other speakers have said, is that the best answer would be a ban on the adding of water above, say, 15%.
I want to be able to go back to my home city - which is a large port through which much of this adulterated meat comes in - and tell our local authorities that they can now expect legislation to back up their long-running pursuit of this deceitful and harmful trade.
. In response to the questions that have been put to me by Mr Whitehead and Mrs Wallis, let me repeat what I said earlier: I have asked my services to consider the development of standards for meat preparations that would limit the amount of water that could be added to such products and indeed the use of animal proteins for the purpose of bulking.
My intention is to analyse the work that has been undertaken by my services, to determine what further work can be done.
I agree, to some extent, that labelling may not be sufficient.
I, like you, have also watched that television programme.
I found that some of the labelling that was identified in the programme indicated that the particular product was 65% chicken.
It raises a question for the consumer: what is the other 35%?
We have spent a great deal of time in this Chamber debating - as we did this afternoon - questions relating to GMOs and the labelling of GMOs.
But it requires some degree of vigilance from consumers: they must read these labels and draw appropriate conclusions.
Having said that, this does not relieve us from examining the appropriate responses to situations such as this and seeking a more satisfactory response.
As I said earlier, in my original answer, I am looking at this.
However, I also appeal for some consumer vigilance as a response to the work that we do here in relation to labelling.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The next item is the report (A5-0240/2003) by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2004 budget in view of the conciliation procedure before the Council's first reading [2003/2027(BUD)].
Before giving the floor to our rapporteur and to those Members who have been placed on the agenda, I remind you that it is 11.40 p.m.
We have a very large number of speakers and this is not the last debate on the agenda.
I therefore ask you all to respect your speaking times.
.
(NL) Mr President, I should like to repeat what I said on a previous occasion. One of the main objectives of the 2004 budget will be the smoothest possible integration of the new Member States.
We shall therefore be spending the whole year working on a budget for probably 25 Member States and on this basis we shall be taking a political decision in December.
In this report we speak of the position that Parliament must take in the conciliation procedure and a number of main subjects traditionally have a part to play in first reading conciliation.
First of all we have agriculture.
The margin of 1.4 billion currently calculated is positive, but all the items in the agriculture budget are based on a dollar-euro rate of 1.07.
This is probably on the low side and so we are also looking to the letter of amendment at the end of October, which will also contain the conclusions of the agricultural negotiations in Luxembourg.
What are the financial consequences of this rate?
Apart from this point, Parliament has set a number of priorities for the agriculture budget in the form of pilot projects or preparatory actions.
In the first place we think that, given the number of outbreaks of infectious animal diseases in the last ten years, there is a great burden on the agriculture budget.
In future the agriculture budget will not have the margins that it has had in the past.
We therefore think that very serious thought must be given to some form or other of insurance system against infectious animal diseases and some or other European animal disease fund will have to be created.
We want to make a start on this.
Secondly, future payments to farmers will be based not only on historical actions, but also on the environment, method, on cross-compliance: one good turn deserves another.
All well and good, but these environmental indicators are not all that precise.
Mrs WallstrÃ¶m has unfortunately disappeared, but there is much to say about the nitrate directive.
Something has to be done about that.
Other points that we consider important are the development of better vaccines against infectious animal diseases and a quality policy for agricultural products.
As for fisheries, the most important point is that the Council, which regrettably is very sparingly present this evening, must as soon as possible take a position with regard to the financing of the reforms that were agreed in December of last year, in particular with regard to the scrapping fund that is mentioned therein.
We think that in principle credits must be made available for this.
Otherwise better control of the quota and more research into fish stocks are the main points for us.
Common foreign and security policy. The Council promised to give Parliament information about this policy as of 15 June.
This information had not arrived by the time of the printing of this resolution.
I understand that it was handed over here just an hour ago.
We shall be examining it closely. We think that we should be informed about everything, not only about the actions, but also about the budget of the European Parliament, as well as about the budgets of the Member States themselves.
Both are communicating vessels and cannot be seen separately from one another.
As regards the structural funds, we think that the N+2 rule must be applied.
We also think it interesting to hear precisely what the estimates have been that are given to the Commission by the Member States each year so that the Commission can draft a good budget.
It is always interesting to make this comparison.
We should like to have this information from the Commission.
Another important point for this budget: we want to promote economic development in the new Member States.
We think that this can for example be done through the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and through investments in these new Member States.
We are therefore expecting good cooperation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London and with the European Investment Fund in Luxembourg.
We shall be raising this as well.
I do have a number of other points, Mr President, but since you, given the lateness of the hour, were so insistent that I keep to my time, this I shall do.
Perhaps the position of the Parliament will emerge later in the resolution itself.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission adopted the preliminary draft budget for 2004 - a historic budget that will, for the first time, cover an EU of 25 Member States - on 30 April and I presented the preliminary draft here in plenary session on 13 May.
Tomorrow we will begin the trilogue, that is to say, the actual negotiations.
This trilogue traditionally concentrates on expenditure for the agricultural, fisheries and common foreign and security policies, the compulsory expenditure.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his comments.
I will not discuss all the points in the report right now - for reasons of time and because talks are continuing today and tomorrow.
I would like to begin by noting an important point of agreement; this is that we want to reach agreement on the budget for 25 Member States by December 2003.
Although the budget resolution can for the time being only be adopted formally for the budget for the EU of the 15, there should be complete agreement on the amending and supplementary budget for the 10 new states in December.
Adjustment of the multi-annual programmes is also important in the light of enlargement.
The Commission has made a proposal for the adjustment of the amounts, and this is now the subject of intensive discussions in the various parliamentary committees.
It is, however, important that we settle the procedural questions now so that agreement can then be reached on the amounts and the legislative changes can be made as quickly as possible.
With regard to the pending legislative procedures, I would like to return briefly to the legal basis for granting support to various institutions - the A-30 lines.
This is also extremely urgent and I am hoping that the Council will deal with it quickly.
Now a brief word on the various areas of expenditure that will be the subject of the trilogue and which Mr Mulder raised.
In October, the Commission will as usual be presenting the adjusted expenditure estimates for agriculture, which will of course take into account the outcome of the Luxembourg agricultural compromise, which contains higher expenditure for 2004 than that suggested by the Commission.
So far as the proposal for insurance for farmers against various risks is concerned, the Commission has commissioned a study of the matter and I am informed that the findings will probably be available this summer.
The Commission will then make the conclusions known and I hope I will be able to tell you more at Parliament's first reading.
If I may turn to expenditure for fisheries, cuts have been made here only in the area of research, and this was the outcome of the negotiations on the Sixth Framework Research Programme, in which Parliament was involved.
EUR 55 million are now available for fisheries research.
Regarding the fisheries agreements themselves, the Commission has informed Parliament about renegotiations and the estimated costs and here, too, we shall be looking at how far the amounts provided will need to be modified in a letter of amendment in October.
The Commission has proposed an increase of 8.4% in the budget line for the common foreign and security policy, in order, among other things, to again fund the expenditure for the special envoys from this budget line.
A brief word about pilot projects and preparatory actions; you say in your report, Mr Mulder, that the margin of EUR 80 million is not very great.
I am actually proud to have been able to rescue the EUR 80 million margin, given the various things my colleagues wanted in this category.
If we make good use of this area for pilot projects and preparatory actions and cooperate as closely as we did last year, I think it will be possible to agree on good projects here.
I would also like to say something about the Structural Funds, which you mentioned, and the Member States' predictions of how much money they will require next year. We are faced here with the usual situation that the Member States estimate a very much higher amount than we have provided for in the proposal.
The Member States say they will need EUR 6.2 billion more.
But I would like to point out that last year, 2002, the Member States' estimates were 70% higher than the amount that was actually taken up.
Let me finally speak about the question of the number of posts at the Commission.
I think it is clear that the Commission can cope with the work involved with ten new Member States only if it has more staff.
It is in all our interests, and especially of course in the interests of the new Member States, that the work is done and that it is done well.
Since all the institutions are making successful enlargement a matter of the highest priority, I am confident that a good solution will be found here, too.
. (NL) As rapporteur for the budget in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am well aware that the budget consultation procedure between Council, Commission and Parliament traditionally focuses on three specific areas, that is agriculture, fisheries and the common foreign and security policy.
As regards the latter I can fully support the three positions that are underlined in the Mulder report.
Since the budget for external policy is approximately EUR 5 billion and that for the common foreign and security policy EUR 40 million, our committee wanted to focus attention on a number of other points than common foreign and security policy.
First of all the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy seeks further clarification from the European Commission on the financial framework for the southeastern Europe region for the period 2004-2006.
Although the European Commission has recently promised an additional EUR 200 million, it is still very unclear precisely where this money is to come from.
Secondly, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is also seeking special attention for the EU police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Although the mission is being conducted more than adequately, we are receiving various signals that necessary materiel is sometimes being supplied too late or not at all.
Finally, our committee is seeking special attention for the additional financial needs of the wider Europe initiative.
Provision must be made for adequate resources for the CARDS, MEDA and TACIS programmes and possibly also for a new neighbourliness tool.
It gives me great pleasure that the Committee on Budgets has taken up this and other recommendations and I should like to compliment Mr Mulder on his clear and powerful report and wish him every success in the tripartite talks.
. (NL) Mr President, I should like to echo the compliments for Mr Mulder's report and input.
In much of it we recognise ourselves as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but at the same time we note that the credits for agriculture and rural development are falling sharply in the 2004 budget.
For agriculture alone the share is falling from 40% to 36%, while there is a slight increase for rural development.
In its policy plans the European Commission says that agriculture must produce with a greater market focus, but at the same time any incentive to do so in the budget is being taken away.
It is not really acceptable that the amount for the promotion of agricultural products for example has been reduced in the preliminary draft budget for 2004.
In addition - as Mr Mulder himself has said - the dollar rate is a great risk: a rate of EUR 1.07 is being assumed and that is substantially lower than the current rate.
The question is what that could mean for the budget in the long term.
There has also, despite a number of outbreaks of major animal diseases, been almost no extra money set aside for possible future outbreaks.
At the same time we have started on a different policy for outbreaks of animal diseases, for example the new policy for foot and mouth disease.
This means that in the event of future outbreaks the Commission might spend far less money on slaughter.
As the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we should like to see this money being set aside to cushion the market consequences for farmers who at the time are vaccinating without the animals being slaughtered, but who experience the consequences of this, that is lower market prices.
This is also the first budget for the Union of 25 Member States and in fact it is very strange that, converted to the structural funds, there is still less money available per head of population for the new Member States than for a number of existing Member States.
To summarise, Mr President, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development thinks that the money that is to be spent on rural development, in particular in the new Member States, must be expressly intended for strengthening the small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas.
There must be extra money for the promotion of agricultural products that meet all the food safety, animal welfare and environmental requirements and money must be set aside, perhaps through fund formation, for cushioning the effects of a different vaccination policy for animal diseases.
. (DE) Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 32 million are needed.
Who can help?
Mr Mulder is willing, who else?
The Commission or the Council perhaps?
Every year we go through the rigmarole of the budget procedure again and unfortunately not everyone's wishes can be met.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Fisheries, I naturally also regret that our wishes do not necessarily have top priority.
The 2004 budget procedure is, however, unusual in two respects.
Firstly, it is the first one to be drawn up using activity-based budgeting; this is an improvement that I very much welcome, since it gives us a clear overview without having to spend a lot of time leafing through the budget lines, especially in the area of fisheries.
Secondly, we are faced with the unusual situation that from 1 January 2004 until 30 April 2004 the budget will apply to the present 15 Member States, but from 1 May 2004, the date of accession of ten new countries, it will apply to 25 Member States.
We are enlarging and have still not done our homework.
The situation is alarming.
In the light of the catastrophic state of fish stocks, last December the Council agreed, after much dragging of feet, to the reform of the common fisheries policy, not least because of clear promptings from Parliament.
One of the most important features of this was the creation of a 'scrapping fund', which was to start before the end of this year.
So far, however, the Council has not given the green light for the use of the flexibility instrument.
That is hard to understand.
I therefore call urgently for this point to be raised in the conciliation procedure beginning on 16 July, so that we can at least learn what position the Council takes on financing reform of the common fisheries policy.
I am by no means releasing the Member States from their responsibility. But we cannot allow the Council to use the Member States' unwillingness to provide the relevant information as an excuse for blocking one of the main purposes of the reform.
Please give us your support.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are attending this debate on budgets at this late hour more than anything else in order to accompany the general rapporteur, Mr Mulder, so that he may feel accompanied and supported by the political groups in this House, with a view to the conciliation which is going to take place on 16 July.
I would like to say that our group, the PPE-DE, fully supports the strategy laid out by the general rapporteur with a view to the conciliation with the other two institutions.
We believe that this first conciliation is of great importance, given that it is the first real exchange of requests and strategies between the three institutions, and I therefore believe we have proposed a conciliation strategy which will be particularly useful and beneficial to the interests of the European Parliament and of the European citizens in general, which is the reason why we are here.
From this strategy which we are taking to the conciliation, the report by Mr Mulder, I simply wanted to highlight certain points which are the subjects of our group's amendments.
In particular, with regard to fisheries, we have heard the explanations given us by the rapporteur on budgets of the Committee on Fisheries, Mrs Langenhagen, and we fully agree with them.
We believe that the Council must fulfil the commitments which were established for the financing of this scrapping fund, not only in 2003, but also in 2004, and that is why we are proposing amendments to the FÃ€rm report and also the Mulder report, although we know that they will possibly not be accepted by some of the groups in this House.
We attach so much importance to this that the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries will form an integral part of the delegation from our group which will go to the budget conciliation, because we want to stress how important the issue of fisheries commitments is to the Committee on Fisheries, to Parliament in general and to our political group.
Finally, another issue which we wish to highlight is the application of the N+2 rule, which has been discussed earlier.
Our argument - and this is expressed in our amendment - is that there is a need for an assessment.
We believe we are at the beginning of the process of applying the N+2 rule and, therefore, rather than making value judgments about what approximation the Commission should carry out in the application of this rule, what really interests us is to be given an assessment of how it is being applied, what the initial results are and, on that basis, to produce a common strategy in this Parliament on the application of the N+2 rule on the part of the Commission in the Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Mulder, for his outstanding success in bringing together the interests of the committee and also in taking up the matters which are necessary for the conciliation procedure ahead and resisting the temptation to rewrite all the guidelines we wrote earlier this year.
This is a report that is very cogent, very concentrated and which we very much support and welcome.
The procedure which we shall now be entering in the next three weeks with the Council and the Commission will continue to exist for a short time.
We hope, however, that it will soon be a thing of the past.
If the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure were no longer made - and there is much in the Convention to suggest it will not be - then something Parliament has been advocating for many years would actually become reality and we would no longer need this advance mediation.
That would be a good development and I hope we shall see it.
Now to the individual points.
So far as agriculture is concerned, a number of matters are raised here. I want to concentrate on a number of questions.
First, the move to increase support for rural areas provided that there is a stronger focus on those areas in the new Member States than we had in the EU of the 15; we expressly welcome this.
In view of the current debates - in Poland in particular, where ministers have resigned because they are evidently missing the opportunity to actually create the structures there that will allow the money to be used properly - I believe that all states must understand that no money can flow if the relevant structures are not in place.
That must be made abundantly clear, and we shall be watching to see that the money is used according to the rules.
All we can do is urge that the foundations be laid for it here.
So far as insurance against eventualities such as disasters in agriculture is concerned, we are willing to look very closely at the survey and the expert report.
Some Member States already have voluntary insurance for such contingencies.
They would of course be penalised if the European taxpayer were to be called upon to cover these things elsewhere.
We will examine this without prejudice and we are willing to act, but we will of course not go blundering blindly into anything either, because we have to know what the long-term consequences might be.
So far as fisheries are concerned, I heard very clearly what Mrs Langenhagen had to say and we have always been prepared to support fisheries and the scrapping of ships where necessary.
We are not, however, going to write any blank cheques, and we are not going to give a few million euros away in advance for a programme that has not been finally evaluated and on which the Council has not taken a position.
We will do the same as we have done with other programmes in the past, such as scrapping in Portugal and Spain.
In those cases, we wanted to have the full programme first and we said we would evaluate it and would then say how much would be made available for it.
We will proceed no differently in this connection than we did with the Portuguese and the Spanish, even though we are now looking at other regions of Europe.
We are in favour of increases on the common foreign and security policy.
I would point out once again, however, that cooperation in peacekeeping is more than just peace enforcement as provided for in the Petersberg tasks of common foreign and security policy; it is also conflict prevention, and we do not support the envisaged reduction in appropriations.
In this matter, we want to continue as before.
Prevention is better than having to use military means to clear up afterwards.
Finally, let me say something about the question of payment.
The N+2 rule was introduced by us all and there was a point to it.
Wanting to check whether it is right at this stage, before it has really come into play for the first time, is quite out of order.
This N+2 rule must be applied, and those who fail to spend their money accordingly must know that there are consequences.
Showing them a way out at this early stage would amount to killing the N+2 rule and we will not go along with that.
Mr President, the report before us on the conciliation procedure with regard to the 2004 budget presents a good picture of Parliament's main areas of focus.
I want to thank Mr Jan Mulder, as a member of my own group and as general rapporteur, for an excellent report.
Next year's budget is legally problematic, as for the first four months the EU will be a community of 15 Member States, but will expand to comprise 25 Member States from the beginning of May.
Because each Member State has to be able to participate in decision-making affecting itself, the budget for the enlarged Union cannot be finalised until after enlargement.
The budget's principles of universality and annuality, however, require that it should be drawn up immediately for the whole year.
For that reason the solution sought, where the budget will be dealt with, as appropriate, in December, with the part that concerns the new Member States not being finalised until there is an Amending Budget next May, is the proper way to proceed.
The budget has also now been clearly presented as an activity-based one.
This will clearly separate operational expenditure, administrative costs and responsibility for implementation for each policy area.
This is an excellent reform. It will increase the budget's information value and facilitate its monitoring.
This system, however, should be improved, for example by including all administrative expenditure in the budget for each policy area, as the report points out.
The biggest weakness in the preliminary draft budget is the meagre amounts for payment appropriations.
They represent just 0.99% of the Gross National Income of the Member States, which is the lowest they have been for 17 years.
At the same time outstanding commitments have skyrocketed and at present are reaching the EUR 126 billion mark. This is an increase of EUR 15.4 billion on last year.
If we want to achieve a balance in EU budget policy, commitments and payments have to be balanced.
This will mean improvements in administration and simplified systems at all levels.
I wish my friend, Mr Mulder, every success with the rest of the work.
Mr President, on the eve of enlargement and half-way through the financial year, cooperation before the Council's first reading takes on special importance.
I concur in general terms with a large proportion of the rapporteur's quantitative analysis of the amounts suggested by the Commission in its preliminary draft.
Even so, I want to take this opportunity to mention a deep and widespread concern at the fact that the preliminary draft budget for 2004 is the smallest, in relative terms, since 1987.
It represents less than 1% of the Community's gross domestic income, and I want to point out that such a low level of expenditure is utterly incompatible with the political ambitions so often claimed for the European Union.
It is also incompatible with the ambitions which should be priorities in the current climate of rising unemployment and socio-economic recession.
There is a logic of constraint, stemming in particular from the Stability Pact, with which we are not in agreement, just as we are not in agreement with the systematic budget reductions made perfectly obvious by the rapporteur's insistence on the restricted application of the 'N+2' rule.
The cancelling of authorisations and the policy of redistributing and anticipating expenses underpin this restrictive logic.
These practices have not only become common: they also detract from the integrity and transparency of the budgetary process.
That is why I can only restate the need for new financial approaches as one way of resolving this situation, which is totally unsustainable.
Mr President, Europe finds itself in economically heavy weather.
All the Member States are having to tighten their belts, the European Union likewise therefore.
Apart from the fact that the 2004 budget is dominated by the accession of an expected ten new Member States, we shall be using the activity-based budgeting tool for the first time.
I want to ensure that the expenditure on administrative management is kept to the minimum possible.
As has already been said, the Commission has based the expenditure on agriculture on too low a euro-dollar rate.
Can the Commission give an indication of the expenditure at the current exchange rate?
I support Amendment No 2 to increase the resources for the fishing vessels scrapping fund.
The Commission must then however exclude any form of capacity expansion or subsidisation from the structural funds, otherwise it is just banging your head against a brick wall.
The drop in the structural funds for the current Member States I applaud.
Strict application of the N+2 rule is necessary, otherwise the reservoir of commitments will endure artificially. Given enlargement this cannot occur.
Amendment No 4 does not therefore warrant any support.
. (DE) Mr President, I would just like to come back to the remark made by the previous speaker, Mr Walter.
He compares the EUR 32 million called for with a sum of money we once paid to Portugal and Spain and with which we now want to assist a few other states.
That is not the case.
This money is for the entire European Union.
That can be checked in the Minutes and, at the Commission's suggestion, it will be made available only if the Council is willing, because it has agreed to the fisheries policy reform.
I just wanted to make that correction.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0233/2003) by Mr FÃ€rm, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2003 budget: implementation profile, transfers of appropriations and supplementary and amending budgets [2003/2026(BUD)].
Mr President, a successful budgetary policy for the EU requires not only decisions on figures and budget items, for the EU has serious problems when it comes to implementing the budget.
An important part of Parliament's budget policy must therefore be about follow-up and evaluation and keeping track of the implementation of the budget.
It is therefore very important that we give due weight to the annual report, which we are debating today, on the implementation of the budget.
There are a number of matters of particular concern to us this year, for example, outstanding commitments.
After four months of 2003, total outstanding commitments - known as RAL - had increased to EUR 126 billion, compared with EUR 110 billion at the same time last year.
Even though we do not have all the facts concerning the causes of this and concerning what are in actual fact abnormal outstanding commitments, the trend is clearly worrying.
We are also concerned about the 2002 surplus of EUR 7.4 billion, even though it is an advance, given that, last year, it was more than double this at EUR 15 billion.
We nonetheless still have underutilisation to the tune of EUR 9 billion, which is an unacceptable figure.
In the case of the 2003 implementation, the beginning of the year even shows a lower level than during the same period of 2002; in particular, category 3 and 4 commitments entered into in April were lower than at the same time last year.
There are a whole lot of different problems.
The recent visit of our delegation to Bosnia, like a host of other contacts, also makes us worry that a lack of information about the new budgetary arrangements may have caused problems, for example for the external delegations.
It can have negative effects upon the benefits, in terms of efficiency, of the reform process and of decentralisation.
We also saw a number of problems within the common foreign and security policy in connection, for example, with the EU's police mission in Bosnia where tenders, contracts etc were concerned.
On this subject, we believe that the Commission should investigate whether separate rules might not be needed to adapt our measures within the common foreign and security policy.
Within the separate expenditure categories, we are still critical of the way in which export subsidies for the transport of live animals are dealt with.
We regret that the Council did not accept our proposal concerning the account plan, which would have made the system significantly more open to inspection.
We must therefore make a new attempt this year.
Because I do not just want to be critical, we can also observe that, for example, rural policy in actual fact exceeds our expectations when it comes to implementation.
What most concern us, however, are the structural measures.
The proportion of implemented payments in this area has declined during the first months of the year in spite of the tough criticism in previous years.
We are also anxious about the increase in outstanding commitments, which rose to almost EUR 94 billion as per 30 April 2003 - an incredible sum!
Where this is concerned, something new needs to happen.
Quite a few fellow MEPs have mentioned the N+2 rule, which we must arrange to be applied effectively.
When it comes to the structural funds, we are delighted about the simplification process begun by the Commission.
We nonetheless believe that it needs to become significantly more vigorous within the current arrangements but, above all, the preparations for a more thorough review prior to the new arrangements must be set in motion quickly.
In category 3, we are a little concerned about research and development.
We are, on the other hand, pleased that there is a positive trend, prior to enlargement, when it comes to the programmes for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as for the pilot project concerning small and medium-sized businesses.
We also welcome the fact that pilot projects and preparatory measures are now part of the implementation plan for 2003, on which we agreed last autumn.
Where external measures were concerned, there was clearly less implementation in April of this year than for the same period of 2002, and this is something that concerns us.
On the other hand, we are pleased about the prompt agreement to activate EUR 79 million from the disaster aid reserve for Iraq, as well as about the new proposals concerning southern Africa and Ethiopia.
We only hope that the situation in Iraq and the Middle East does not give rise to such a degree of uncertainty in connection with the 2003 budget that it could entail problems for the other areas within external policy.
That is not something we intend to accept.
Finally, one of the basic problems we have when it comes to implementing the budget is that, overall, we have a rigid budgetary system that really needs to be modernised and altered.
This is, however, basically a task for the Convention, which will shortly have concluded its work, and for the future constitution.
Where this is concerned, I hope that we shall see a radical reform in the future.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased that we are holding so timely a debate on budget implementation so early in the year.
Parliament receives the figures on budget implementation on a weekly basis.
These are direct figures from the accounts.
No Parliament of the Member States is kept informed like this.
I stress this because the Commission's accounting has been and is a subject of public debate and a lot of things are said that are not always entirely correct.
I am glad that we can debate the matter properly here and I thank the rapporteur for his detailed report.
Apart from these weekly figures, you also receive a report three times a year commenting on the implementation of the budget and giving details in particular of so-called abnormal RALs, that is commitments the Commission entered into a very long time ago and commitments for which no payments have been made in the last three years.
The level of commitments entered into and which will result in corresponding expenditure in the next few years amounts now - at the end of June - to a total of EUR 122 000 million.
I agree with Mr FÃ€rm, the rapporteur, that this amount needs to be reduced quickly.
But I also agree that we must be careful not to label the total amount of RALs as abnormal because this year that is not correct.
The Commission has a budget for commitment appropriations showing their amount, something that is not the case in many Member States, for example.
I would like to comment on a few points or questions from your report, Mr FÃ€rm.
First the question of the directorates general or policy areas to which the total 717 posts approved by the Budgetary Authority in 2001 and 2002 were allocated.
You will be getting a detailed listing of these.
In the last few years we have strengthened the foreign policy area, among others, and also such implementing areas as, for example, regional policy or the growing area of justice and internal affairs.
Another point: what is the staffing plan for the Enlargement DG in 2004, after the accession of the ten new Member States?
The 2004 Budget assumes there will be an appreciable reduction in staffing, in the number of posts in this directorate general, a reduction of 105 posts in fact.
You must bear in mind that the Enlargement Directorate-General's activity next year will not be confined to the candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, but that it will continue to administer pre-accession aid; also, a specific programme was agreed for 2004 and subsequent years in the accession negotiations to continue to give administrative assistance for the development of a good administration.
The further trend for the Enlargement DG will then be reviewed in the course of the 2005 budget procedure.
Regarding the state of budget execution this year, you also note that implementation is less than at the same time last year.
This has in fact to do with the work involved in bringing in the new Financial Regulation. This new Financial Regulation brings far-reaching changes for financial management.
It is a fundamental reform.
The Directorate General for the Budget trained over 1 000 members of staff last year.
But there is much that is new and requires familiarisation.
Recipients of payments have to be asked for better security arrangements, for example.
That also requires a degree of familiarisation on our side.
I would like to make a few special comments about budget implementation in the external fields.
Generally speaking, the rate of utilisation in the first few months of this year does not necessarily set the trend for the rest of the year.
So far, commitments totalling EUR 1 800 million have been made, which is not at all bad.
With regard to pre-accession aid, I would also like to point out that in this case implementation continues to be unsatisfactory.
If, however, you compare this year's budget implementation figures with those from last year, you can see that there has been some acceleration.
We had a special situation with humanitarian aid.
You mentioned it yourself.
Here, funding was cut in the course of the 2003 budget procedure, even remembering that there is the emergency reserve.
The Budgetary Authority has approved EUR 79 million for humanitarian work in Iraq.
We have asked for a further EUR 25 million for southern Africa and tomorrow we will be talking about a further EUR 15 million for Ethiopia.
I hope we will find agreement on that, too, because it is essential that aid be provided really quickly here.
I think everyone involved agrees with that.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, early or late we can now discuss the implementation of the 2003 Budget.
I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mr FÃ€rm, most sincerely for carefully reading the figures that he has kindly made available to us.
What he read was of course not so pleasing, and I would like to sum up in only very general terms by saying that, as a member of one part of the Budgetary Authority, I have to ask myself what force and what decisiveness we must bring to bear in order, together with the Council, to prepare a budget - which is, after all, policy in figures - when those who have to implement it are far from being in a position to implement that policy in the way the Budgetary Authority wanted.
That is in fact a fundamental criticism that I have already voiced in this place on a number of occasions, and things get no better, they get worse.
That cannot of course be the Commission's long-term strategy.
The budgets we present are always tight ones, and then we want to make ourselves more popular with the Member States by not spending the money we have just argued over so passionately.
I now have a large number of complaints on the table where individual groups that are supposed to be supported out of the Community budget, as is stipulated in the rules on the matter, are faced with massive administrative problems in negotiations with the Commission, especially this year because of the new Financial Regulation.
All the rules must be followed, but my plea here would be that we also help to ensure that in the end resources actually can flow.
Bureaucracy - or the proper control of the use of resources - is not there to make payments basically impossible.
Mr President, this year's general rapporteur for the budget, Mr GÃ¶ran FÃ€rm, has produced an excellent report on the implementation of the budget and I wish to thank him sincerely for that.
The report quite rightly examines two key points in detail, those being outstanding commitments and decommitment, that is, the N+2 rule.
As I mentioned earlier on, outstanding commitments stood at EUR 126 billion in April, which was an increase of over EUR 15 billion in one year.
These outstanding commitments were especially evident in the Structural Funds where they stood at EUR 94 billion, which is to say the amount for appropriations for almost three years.
The situation is grave.
At the start of the present programming period the N+2 rule was approved.
It states that there is to be decommitment if no payments have been made for two years.
The Commission seems to be interpreting the rule in such a way that advance payments, which are not even based on any invoices presented, should be regarded as payments.
A project can be kept alive in this way from one year to the next by means of small advance payments, even though the project itself might not have even begun to be implemented.
The Commission should improve the way the N+2 rule is monitored and restore its original purpose.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the motion for a resolution (B5-0320/2003) by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on trafficking in children and child soldiers.
Mr President, the European Parliament has already issued two resolutions on the question of child soldiers, one in 1999 and one in 2000.
Why use the procedure for urgent cases, then, to include on the agenda a recommendation for a new resolution, one which goes further, of course, since it extends not only to child soldiers, but to all forms of trafficking in children?
The reason is that the problem is still growing and the European Union is not showing enough determination.
Three hundred thousand children, boys and girls, are enlisted in combat units in more than 30 countries.
Every year, 1.2 million children are victims of a traffic which has now become a rapidly-expanding 'industry', worth almost EUR 3 billion per year.
After drugs and small arms trafficking, it is the third most lucrative criminal activity in the world.
The fight against this scourge - beyond comprehension in the twenty-first century - should be a cornerstone of European Union development policy.
It is a sad fact that this is not the case.
On the world stage, however, more and more action is being taken, as demonstrated by the coming into force, in 2002, of the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.
We request that the Council encourage Member States to ratify this protocol with immediate effect, for too few of them have done so up to now.
We also request that children's rights become a political priority for the Union, to be reflected in budgetary decisions involving the allocation of sufficient resources to a specific heading, with a view to improving their effectiveness and raising their profile. This priority is also to be reflected in a common strategy.
The Council, of course, adopted such a common strategy in principle on 10 December 2002, but the final document should appear and come into force without delay.
Our motion for a resolution suggests several courses of action in this connection. These include the appointment of a high-level representative for children's rights; a common policy focusing on preventive measures; support and protection of victims; closer cooperation with the countries of origin; and international arrest warrants against the organisers and perpetrators of this unspeakable traffic.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Carlotti on her speech.
I am surprised that no-one from the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, that tabled three amendments to this report, has spoken in this debate.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the draft report on children's rights that has been prepared for the meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
It highlights the enormous challenge facing the international community over the protection of children's rights.
First, on the subject of child soldiers.
The European Union supports the UN special representative and welcomes the initiatives of the UN Security Council, in particular Resolution 1460 of 30 January 2003.
The European Union calls on all states to ratify the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to hasten ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which describes the conscription and recruitment of children under the age of 15 or their deployment in hostilities as a war crime.
At the political level, the European Union is endeavouring to find a common line on the problem of child soldiers.
In December 2002, the Council authorised the development of a strategy or guidelines on this subject.
UNICEF and other agencies then organised a meeting of experts on children's rights on 14 March 2003.
The recommendations made at that meeting stress among other things the importance of a pre- and post-conflict strategy and the necessity of making this subject a cross-sectional topic in the European Union's entire decision-making process.
The Council working party on human rights will, in due course, be examining what steps should be taken next.
Regarding European financing for measures to help children in armed conflicts, the following must be said. Children are a focus for humanitarian aid in ECHO.
This commitment is reflected in specific projects, advocacy measures and research activities.
Children are one of the three focal points of the ECHO strategy for the current year.
Secondly, on combating trafficking in children.
The European Union has introduced a large number of legislative, political and financial initiatives.
In 2002, the Council adopted the framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings and reached political agreement on the draft for a framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
On the Commission's initiative, the 'European Conference on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings - a Global Challenge for the Twenty-first Century' was held from 18 to 20 September last year.
The Brussels declaration was a concrete outcome of that conference.
Then on 25 March 2003 the Commission decided to set up a group of experts on trafficking in human beings, which will assist the Commission in putting forward further concrete proposals at European level.
The group will in particular present the Commission with a report based on the recommendation of the Brussels declaration.
In 2002, more than EUR 1.7 million were used as part of the STOP II programme to finance 16 projects to combat trafficking in human beings and to combat sexual exploitation.
The TACIS and CARDS programmes also support projects to combat trafficking in human beings in east and southeast Europe, and an action plan against trafficking in human beings has also been developed as part of the EU-Africa dialogue.
Thirdly, on the subject of 'children and development', the Commission is pursuing the Millennium Development Goals as its objectives, in particular the achievement of universal primary education and the reduction of infant and child mortality.
Although children as such are not a specific target group of our development policy, they benefit from a large amount of aid in the areas of education, health, AIDS and population policy.
Finally, the Cotonou Agreement, for example, contains specific provisions for the protection of young people, in particular combating child labour.
The Commission has also intensified its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation as a whole for the purpose of promoting these objectives.
Finally, I would like to note that the report contains many interesting proposals for increasing the European Union's commitment to children's rights.
It is true that the Community currently has no specific competences in this area.
We await, however, with interest the outcome of the talks on the draft constitutional treaty, the European Convention, which for the first time provides for the protection of children's rights as a specific objective of the European Union.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that detailed response.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12.38 a.m.)
The programme of the Italian Presidency
The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the programme of the Italian Presidency.
, President-in-Office of the Council.
(IT) Mr President, as one of the founding countries, Italy has a long experience of remaining true to the spirit and the letter of the Treaties, which, within the space of a few decades, have enabled us to develop peacefully one of the most remarkable political and institutional experiments in the history of mankind.
Italy is therefore keenly aware of the moral and intellectual responsibility and honour of presiding over the Union in this constituent period, when we need to hold on firmly to the lessons of the past in order to build the future, to deal with new developments and seize opportunities that were previously unimaginable, and to overcome differences by finding new solutions, which in turn will enrich our shared project.
With the full accession of new Member States and the attendant redefining of our identity, it is time to recognise the value of the art of negotiation.
Europe as we know it, as built by its governing classes, is the product of enormous determination and brilliant intuition, which have given a spirit and language to shared values and feelings; these have brought together and revitalised the separate strands of national history, traditions and culture.
The Europe of today is great: it owes its greatness to its achievements, to its potential, to its proud contribution to peace and international law, but it owes its particular greatness to the specific technical expertise which it has brought to bear, overcoming every crisis, clash of interests and difference in vision by applying a common method, common rules and a common approach to adjusting both method and rules to the realities of a changing world.
We all know that there is sometimes a price to be paid for negotiation and that it may be high.
If it is not driven by the enthusiasm of shared goals, negotiation can look very much like bureaucratic paralysis, a long and extenuating process of avoiding problems and procrastination.
The Italian Parliament, which has never feared the truth, has been acutely aware of the bouts of fatigue and the tendency to sell Europe short which have at times characterised our common European endeavour, and it has condemned those tendencies with frank, pro-European zeal.
With the self-confidence born of long experience and the humility needed to tackle crucial political issues, Italy will therefore do everything in its power and everything it feels is necessary to provide Parliament, the Commission and the governments of the European Council with the environment most conducive to taking informed, calm and responsible political decisions on our future.
The purpose of negotiation is, indeed, to enable decisions to be taken on substance, and the measure of our success in settling our differences will be whether it enables us to make a great leap forwards and to give our gradually integrating economies, our cultures, our foreign policy and our defence policy a new and efficient institutional shape.
A great Europe needs great institutions.
If the world calls for Europe to act authoritatively in tackling today's major challenges - the fight against terrorism, the reduction of inequalities and imbalances, world economic recovery - it is our duty to respond with a Union which can act decisively and therefore exert influence, a Union which can take resolute, clear decisions on the basis of a clear grasp of the common interest and commonly held convictions which are above any form of particularism.
This Union, which we have decided to build together, whose shape has also been discussed during the splendid work of the Convention chaired by Mr ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing and benefiting from the vigorous contribution of the Greek Presidency and representatives of the Commission, the European Parliament and the national Parliaments, can only be founded on the framework of values and historical experience that, for over half a century, has bound us to that other great exponent of modern liberal democracy, the United States, co-founder with us of the Atlantic Alliance.
If this web of different partnerships - at a different level of political integration - is again to live up to its ambitions and its civilising achievements, for the sake of peace and world security, relations between States must cease to be conducted in monologues and, instead, we must seek to reinstate open, genuine, honest dialogue.
Europe can be cured of its Hamlet syndrome and decide to become a wholehearted, active player on the world stage; it can acquire the diplomatic, economic and military means to perform that role convincingly, without jeopardising its autonomy, its roots or the great freedom-giving structures defended over the years within the framework of its Western alliances.
As we found at the recent Summit in Thessaloniki, there is deep, shared understanding of this, set out in the very valuable document coordinated by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, which seeks, in a new strategic vision, to overcome the differences that have emerged over recent months with regard to the tragic crisis in Iraq and developments in the crucial issue of the Middle East.
Italy knows that it is not alone in venturing once more to wager on successful negotiation in order to move the situation forward.
In the European Parliament, under its President, Pat Cox, and in the political groups with which we had an enjoyable, valuable meeting in Rome, we feel we have an attentive, patient partner but one which would not fail to hold us to account for our mistakes.
In the Commission and its President, Romano Prodi, we see the essential link ensuring continuity in the administration and day-to-day coordination of our institutional system.
The European Council, in both the reinvigoration of the plan for growth, based on large-scale investment in civil infrastructure, and the great constitutional opportunity presented by the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, will be the forum in which this six-month Union Presidency, which falls to Italy, will seek to define a bold but not reckless agreement on the major issues of institutional balance, the extension of qualified majority voting, the limits of the common foreign and security policy and the European area of justice.
We cannot overlook the fact that Member States' views on some of these questions still differ.
The Italian Presidency will do its utmost to bring about convergence of these positions although it is fully aware that the debate on the Convention's draft Constitutional Treaty cannot be completely reopened.
The Intergovernmental Conference will therefore have to focus its efforts on the genuine points of contention still outstanding.
This ground plan has also dictated the Presidency's goal of adhering to the timetable suggested by the Thessaloniki European Council.
Thus, we will open the Intergovernmental Conference in October and keep the proceedings to a tight schedule with a view to reaching agreement by December.
(Applause from the right)
The European Parliament will be involved in the work of the Conference in the most appropriate manner.
I call upon the European Council to involve the President of the European Parliament in the work of the Prime Ministers and Heads of Government on a permanent basis.
(Applause from the right)
I call upon the General Affairs Council to involve the representatives of the European Parliament in their work on a permanent basis. The proceedings will be conducted at a senior political level in order to avoid the impetus provided by the Convention getting bogged down in detailed diplomatic negotiations, as has happened in earlier Intergovernmental Conferences.
With this in mind, I undertake to return here to address you after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the day after the December European Council, so that we can review together what has been achieved.
The goal is to enable the future Constitutional Treaty to be signed sometime between 1 May 2004 (the date on which the ten new Member States will officially join the Union) and the elections in June 2004 for the next Parliamentary term.
Any extension of the negotiations beyond those dates would mean dissipating the precious store of constitutional wisdom developed by the Convention; it would also involve asking European voters to elect their Parliament without knowing the institutional shape of the future Union.
I can, moreover, only rejoice that, for appreciable reasons of historical and symbolic continuity with the original Treaties of 1957, it has been agreed that the final signing of the Constitutional Treaty is to take place in Rome.
We are honoured by this prospect and will do everything possible to ensure that the Member States' representatives are welcomed in a manner worthy of the occasion and, of course, of our traditions of hospitality.
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, constitutional reform is certainly a top priority for the future of European integration, but the Union must also be able to meet its citizens' legitimate day-to-day expectations.
Europe must increasingly live up to its role of creating economic growth and prosperity.
Here, we are on solid ground: the euro is an element of stability for the economies of the Member States which have chosen to support monetary union, and the Lisbon Strategy mapped out a process of convergence to increase European competitiveness.
However, we cannot overlook the persistent flaws of our economic structures, evidence of which lies in the lower-than-forecast growth rates.
On the basis of the annual operating programme presented jointly with the Greek Presidency at the beginning of 2003, the Italian Presidency has set out a number of specific initiatives.
The modernisation of agriculture, environmental protection, consumer protection and food safety are essential requirements for our citizens; in these areas Italy will steer work towards the goals identified by earlier Presidencies.
I will therefore confine myself here and now to three points which we feel are crucial for Europe's competitiveness.
The first point is the need to provide more effective support for the economy by increasing public and private investment with the cooperation of the European financial institutions, especially the EIB.
We consider that such a strategy should be based especially on boosting the policy of major Trans-European infrastructure networks.
If the internal market is to work efficiently in the enlarged Union, it will require greater mobility of goods and services and a more efficient transport network.
The need here is to square the legitimate requirements of monetary stability and financial rigour - which must not be called into question in any way - with the need to stimulate economic growth more powerfully through investment in research and technological innovation as well as infrastructure, for we firmly believe that the European economy's most important resource is its human capital.
(Applause from the right)
The second priority is discussion of the sustainability of the European pension and welfare systems.
Intergenerational solidarity and the adaptation of existing schemes to the reality of a progressively ageing society are challenges that we can no longer shy away from.
Bearing in mind that situations differ from Member State to Member State, we must investigate policies to increase the level of employment among older workers and to reduce the trend towards early retirement.
Our third and last point is the need to modernise the labour markets and promote entrepreneurship, particularly where small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned.
In this field, too, the opportunities offered by the great internal market which is being extended to include the ten new Members will elude the EU Member States unless they adopt a coordinated approach.
These strategies can be implemented through dialogue between the social partners.
Indeed, the European model is based on a market economy which seeks to strike a balance between free enterprise and the claims of cohesion and solidarity.
In this connection, there can be no neglecting that more vulnerable, silent section of Europe's population, whom legislative inertia all too often prevents from taking a leading role but whose civil and moral contribution remains invaluable.
I am referring to the 38 million European citizens with disabilities.
The European Union has proclaimed 2003 the 'European Year of People with Disabilities'.
In addition to the awareness-raising and information events and campaigns already organised, the Italian Presidency will endeavour to lay the foundations for legislative action to combat discrimination, for an instrument to protect people with disabilities in all aspects of daily life and give them a future of hope.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union also contributes to international stability, and its responsibility in this respect starts at its immediate borders and depends on its capacity to be open to increasingly advanced forms of cooperation with neighbouring countries.
In this case too, the Italian Presidency intends to carry on the work of previous presidencies.
During the current period between the signing and the entry into force of the Accession Treaties, we shall seek to ensure that the 10 new Member States participate fully in the work of the Council, making it easier for them to be fully integrated into the Union's institutional mechanisms.
At the same time, we shall attempt to establish by December a roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania which paves the way for the accession of both countries by 2007.
We shall continue the pre-accession strategy vis-Ã -vis Turkey on the basis of the conditions established at the Copenhagen European Council last December.
We know that the decision on the date for opening negotiations will not be taken until the end of next year, but, with this in mind, we consider it all the more advisable that the Union should actively support the reform process already initiated by the current Turkish Government.
We shall continue to emphasise the European prospects of the countries of the Western Balkans, in line with the Zagreb Process.
The agenda we agreed upon at Thessaloniki represents a further step forward.
In retrospect, analysing the European Union's role in the Balkans, we can be proud of ourselves.
If we compare the current situation to the situation 10 years ago, we can see that intervention by Europe and the United States made it possible to bring to an end the bloody conflicts of the former Yugoslavia, the last major European civil war, and we hope that this will also prove to be the last time that European blood is shed on European soil.
We believe it is now time to move on from the present phase of association and stabilisation agreements to a more integrated strategy, with a view to strengthening our relationship with the countries of the region.
We are aware of the complexity of this approach, but we also know that Europe is offering the only prospects able to provide the governments of those countries with an effective incentive to proceeding without delay along the path of reform, modernisation, the free market and the rule of law.
The Italian Presidency sees the invitation from the Commission, supported by the Member States, to encourage increasingly close relations with the areas closest to us to bring about what we have labelled 'Wider Europe', in a very positive light.
We shall therefore seek to strengthen our relations with Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
We shall likewise seek to consolidate relations with the Russian Federation particularly strongly through increasingly close dialogue and specific measures that are tangible confirmation of Russia's desire to belong to the political, economic, social and cultural fabric of Europe and the West.
We consider that the focus on Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism should now be mirrored by equal interest in the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue; this dialogue is crucial for relations between the West and the Islamic world, an issue we feel to be as important today as Eastern Europe has been in the past.
Our aim is to establish a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area, already launched by the Barcelona Conference.
The economic and social development of the southern area of the Mediterranean is essential to world stability, in view of the culture, politics and demographics of the southern Mediterranean.
The integration of Europe's economy with that of the Arab countries is a major challenge of our time and is the key to peace and security in this area and in Europe as a whole.
We shall therefore cultivate the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, to which we shall devote a large number of economic, cultural and social initiatives - including a Foundation for Dialogue between Cultures and Civilisations - and we shall cultivate the project to transform the financial facility currently operating within the EIB into an autonomous body, in other words a genuine Mediterranean Bank.
On the basis of the decisions adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conferences in Valencia and Crete and approved by the Thessaloniki European Council, the Italian Presidency endorses the wish expressed by the European Parliament and the national Parliaments to see a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly established during this Presidency as a mark of a constant commitment to dialogue between Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean seaboard.
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, establishing conditions for international security is now a key task for the countries which share a set of universal values based on freedom, democracy and peace.
This is the main area in which fundamental transatlantic relations and the partnership between Europe and the United States must now be reinvigorated.
We wish to confirm our conviction that there is no incompatibility between a strong European undertaking and equally strong transatlantic solidarity.
Mindful of this, we will strive to restore depth and dynamism to the relationship between the Union and the United States, which are also vital if Europe is to have greater authority on the world stage.
The establishment of a solid, balanced transatlantic relationship also depends on a substantial European undertaking in the field of defence, in line with the NATO framework.
The fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and support for the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are specific areas in which to test our ability to build a solid relationship of cooperation between the two shores of the Atlantic. We are thinking in this particular instance of the need to establish a democratic civil fabric in the reconstruction of Iraq and support for the peace process in the Middle East.
As regards the Middle East, we are quite aware that the situation is extremely complex.
Our Presidency, together with the United States, the Russian Federation and the United Nations, will work in support of the roadmap towards the establishment of time limits and procedures for launching an international peace conference.
My country has offered to hold the conference in Sicily.
There are at least two lines of action that we intend to promote: firstly, restoring a relationship of greater trust with Israel with a view to broader and more structured mutual cooperation, and, secondly, implementing the plan - already launched by Italy at European Councils and G8 Summits - for rebuilding the Palestinian economy, which could act as a tangible, effective incentive in negotiations between the parties.
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of brevity, I cannot list all the Union's responsibilities on the world stage, but I feel bound to mention the economic, cultural, civil and, I would venture, spiritual ties that link Europe with Latin America, a region currently experiencing a period of change which Europe hopes will generate freedom and justice.
The Latin American States have asked us to open up our trade frontiers.
The success of Latin America is that of the other America, linked to Europe in a different but no less significant fashion than North America.
I also wish to say that we shall work to strengthen our existing ties with Africa, to which we are bound through its unhappy history, with Asia, with the regional organisations and with the United Nations system to move forward together on the great challenges of the fight against poverty and disease, environmental protection and conflict prevention.
We will also focus on the balanced development of international trade as a source of greater well-being and reduction of inequalities - the subject of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference in Cancun next September.
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the citizens of Europe want democratic, transparent institutions, a prosperous economy and a free society, but also an area of freedom and security.
At Tampere, Seville and, most recently, at Thessaloniki, the European Council recognised the need to enhance Europe's capacity to combat transnational organised crime, illegal immigration and related trafficking, through more effective controls at the Union's external borders.
We will endeavour to work on these points, focusing on the mobilisation of adequate financial resources, the gradual implementation of a common readmission policy and the integrated management of external borders.
Above all, however, we will emphasise the need to include illegal immigration issues in relations between the Union and the countries of origin and transit of migration flows.
We must introduce effective forms of cooperation with some of our neighbours, especially in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, in the field of control and management of migration flows.
Our legitimate request for more effective cooperation from these countries in endeavours to prevent illegal immigration will be matched by willingness on our part to integrate citizens of third countries legally resident on Union territory.
As well as continuing legislative work on asylum and visas, we consider it a priority to improve the operation of all the Union's operating mechanisms for combating crime, starting with the strengthening of Europol.
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear from my remarks just how sensitive and complex the challenges facing the European Union are, challenges to which our Presidency will endeavour to help find a solution in the limited time available, in a spirit of humility and service and in the full, firm knowledge that the security and prosperity of our future will depend increasingly on the process of European integration which has guaranteed us peace, freedom, security and well-being for half a century now.
The Europe of today is no longer the airy kite capable of playing the winds of history that it was at the time of the Treaty of Rome.
Our Union has become much stouter and is weighed down with responsibilities and duties towards its partners and the rest of the world.
My hope is that, during the Italian Presidency and looking onwards to the Irish Presidency, we shall succeed, with the cooperation of all those involved and with the particular help of the new Member States, in restoring to our institutional giant something of its lightness and its original energy.
(Applause from the right)

President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian Presidency is beginning at a critical point in the life of the Union. It has the tough but exhilarating task of carrying through the revision of the Union's founding Treaties and delivering the first European Constitution.
Indeed, the six months of the Italian Presidency will see the start of the Intergovernmental Conference, which will work on the basis - the 'good basis' to quote the Thessaloniki Conclusions - of the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention.
The Convention is Europe's first experience of a constitution-building process.
We should therefore not underestimate the impact of the word 'Constitution' on our European life, which has made it possible to achieve results that appeared quite unattainable a while ago.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights will be enshrined in the Constitutional Treaty.
The Union will have a single legal personality: this considerably strengthens its international status.
Defining the powers of the Union will allow the citizens to distinguish more clearly between the competences of the Union and those of the Member States.
I have never pretended, however, that I was happy that certain reforms I consider indispensable - and which many have called for - have been tackled too timidly or not at all.
In September when the Intergovernmental Conference opens, the Commission will accordingly be putting the key issues still unresolved on the negotiating table with its opinion.
Qualified-majority voting has been extended to many areas but not enough to meet the needs of an enlarged Union: there are other areas where unanimity should no longer be required.
The Union can hardly function effectively if decision-making calls for unanimity among 25 Member States: it would be impossible.
The proposed arrangements for the make-up of the Commission do not reconcile the need for representativeness and the need for efficiency.
A permanent presidency of the European Council is likely to bring overlapping and conflicts with the Commission.
The euro, one of the Union's greatest political achievements - maybe the greatest - is still not represented effectively and coherently on the international stage.
Clauses also need to be inserted on amending the Constitution by an enhanced majority.
I cannot see how the Constitution can be adapted to the Union's new requirements without a procedure for amendments based on majority voting.
No reform is possible on the basis of unanimity.
Lastly, a more democratic and efficient institutional framework, which should come out of the Intergovernmental Conference, is vital, not least for an economic and social policy and a foreign policy with more clout.
The Commission has the political will, the arguments and, if I may say so, the enthusiasm to press these points home forcefully.
President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the other major challenge of the next six months is to press ahead with the building of 'Greater Europe' and to implement the new neighbourhood strategy.
As we push on with enlargement, we also need to fully implement the pre-accession strategy for the candidate countries.
The Commission is working actively on this.
The aim is for this process to work well to the benefit of our fellow citizens and the Member States, both current and acceding.
With the momentum provided by the Thessaloniki Council we can also continue to forge an ever-closer partnership with the Balkans, without which this phase of the enlargement process can never be considered to be complete.
At Thessaloniki, we agreed on an agenda to take the Balkan countries to full membership of the Union.
I am sure that the Italian Presidency will do its utmost to keep this region at the top of the Union's priorities.
I am pleased that the strategy I proposed, the development of a ring of friendly countries, is starting to produce the anticipated results, and I welcome the unanimous support of the Heads of State and Government for this long-term European Union policy.
In this context, it is vital that we move on to the practical phase of the new neighbourhood strategy without delay, with specific action plans and new systems of assistance.
We are preparing a number of proposals along these lines for Parliament and the Council to consider and develop.
In particular, as regards the Mediterranean region, I hope the Euro-Mediterranean Bank and the Foundation for Intercultural Dialogue will be in place by the end of the year.
As you said, President-in-office, the European Union made an invaluable contribution to the drafting of the roadmap, alongside the United States, Russia and the United Nations, and it must also play a key role in its implementation.
We will continue to pay close attention to transatlantic relations.
The recent EU-US Summit in Washington marked an important milestone in our relations with the United States.
Quite apart from the matters discussed - and the discussions proved to be amongst our meatiest in recent years - the most important aspect was the firm determination displayed on both sides to reestablish a climate of cooperation and solidarity.
I am not saying there are no differences in our viewpoints and approaches to particular issues, but even where this is so, the strength of our relationship cannot be called into question.
As I said at the Summit, our goals are the same, even if we seek at times to achieve them in quite different ways.
Perhaps the clearest example of this fact is the relationship between the United States and the European Union in the field of international trade.
Both sides want fewer barriers and better access to markets, fairer trade and clearer rules that are also appropriately tuned to encouraging the poorest countries.

On some of these topics our practical approaches are different, but this does not stop us having a close, ongoing relationship that allows us to work round our differences, nor does it stop us working together to achieve a positive outcome in the multilateral talks within the World Trade Organisation.
I want to make this quite clear, for all this is possible because the Union speaks and negotiates with a single voice in trade matters.
It makes it a powerful, influential partner, which it is most certainly not in areas where competence is divided and fragmentary.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, the toughest challenge we face is to restore the conditions for vigorous, balanced, enduring economic growth in the Union.
The situation is difficult: economic growth has slowed down significantly, although I do not believe there is any reason to speak of deflation.
At the same time, we must tackle the reform of Europe's social security system too.
Competition from our trading partners and the ageing of our population make such reforms extremely urgent.
However, before us there is also a great, unique opportunity: an integrated Single Market of almost half a billion people.
I do not think we have realised what a powerful tool we have for the future.
It is therefore crucial that we give practical thought to instruments for strengthening coordination of the Union's economic and fiscal policies, so that we can tackle the difficulties together and exploit together the enormous advantages the Union offers.
The Commission is aware of how serious these challenges are and, in recent months, it has proposed two initiatives, which the European Council strongly supported.
Firstly, we proposed - and our proposal was taken up - to utilise all the flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact so each country can adapt its fiscal policy to its own economic situation, without losing sight of the stability objectives and without overshooting the 3% limit laid down in the Pact.
As I have said on a number of occasions, this was necessary but not sufficient.
We need to move towards a period of closer coordination, and tax policies in the Member States - particularly those with the highest public debts - need to become more sustainable in the long term.
Secondly, at the Brussels European Council last March, I raised the issue on behalf of the Commission of the need to give fresh impetus to completing the infrastructure necessary for European development and for supporting research, increasing spending to reach our target of 3% of the Union's GDP, as, moreover, is provided for in the goals we ourselves set at Lisbon.
At the same European Council, I voiced my concern that investment in research in the Member States has actually, without a doubt, declined compared with last year, while Europe's major firms are transferring a growing proportion of their research outside Europe.
Hundreds of thousands of our brightest talents are leaving Europe to work - and stay all their lives, unlike the Asians, who return home - in the United States.
That is why the Commission has decided to react.
In conjunction with the European Investment Bank, it is finalising an initiative to help to increase overall investment and private-sector participation in two key areas - trans-European networks and research and development projects - with a view to achieving the Lisbon targets.
We want to mobilise and coordinate all the Union's current sources of funding and explore possible alternatives, without jeopardising Member States' budget stability.
The Commission is pleased to note that the Italian Government has recently expressed its firm support for this strategy.
Lastly, we need to speed up the approval of proposals prepared by the Greek Presidency but not yet approved.
Approval of these measures in the course of the Italian Presidency will help to improve the Union's economic and social outlook.
In particular, the proposed legislation concerns the following fields: temporary-employment agency work, take-over bids, measures in the wake of the 'Prestige' disaster, security of gas and electricity supplies, the second rail services liberalisation package, environmental liability rules, implementation of the 10-year action plan for people with disabilities, due to be presented by the Commission during the Italian Presidency, public procurement rules, the creation of the Single European Sky, the extremely important, impatiently-awaited directive on traceability of GMOs, the finalisation of the Directive on the European Patent, harmonisation of asylum procedures, the status of refugees, and, lastly, the Agreement with the ESA on the development of the European Space policy.
I am confident that, with the help of the Italian Presidency and with your own help, President-in-Office, we will be able to adopt speedily the practical decisions needed to achieve these goals.
Economic recovery is not just about reform: it also calls for confidence that proposals can be put into effect quickly.
President Cox, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, these are the main challenges we must meet in the coming months.
We are about to lay the foundations of a completely new Europe, and these foundations are political and economic, not just constitutional.
The Commission is working to preserve and consolidate a strong and prosperous Europe that is also just and inclusive.
The greatness of the European project lies precisely in its capacity to foster and extend peace, democracy, justice, prosperity and solidarity.
Lastly, the Commission has fulfilled its responsibility to launch a wide-ranging internal debate on the post-2006 Financial Perspective.
In the autumn, we will be presenting our political project for the enlarged and reformed European Union for discussion at the December European Council under the Italian Presidency.
The forthcoming Financial Perspective represents a crucial stage in the European project.
By 2007, the Union will have a new constitutional framework, in all likelihood 27 Members and a population of almost 500 million.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at a crucial time in the Union's history.
A time that calls for unity and a strong commitment to cooperation among all the Community institutions and between the institutions and the governments of the Member States.
I am confident that we will find the right solutions to the great issues facing Europe today.
This calls for vision and conviction.
For vision, because we really are laying the foundations for the Europe of decades to come, and we cannot accept short-term solutions that merely respond to the - albeit difficult - current economic climate.
For conviction, because Europe is not just one of several options, one of a number of different alternatives.
Europe is the only way forward: without Europe, our countries and societies will be irreversibly relegated to a marginal role.
Italy has been there since the start of the European integration project and has always played an extremely important role.
Think of the Treaty of Rome, think of the preparation of the Single European Act, think, on a more general note, of the enthusiasm and conviction with which Italy has helped to achieve the major goals of European integration, starting right here in this House with great Parliamentarians such as Altiero Spinelli and Emilio Colombo.
We are all confident that Italy will continue unhesitatingly along that path.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Berlusconi, you received loud applause for your speech here in the European Parliament.
I hope that will be indicative of the success of the Italian Presidency that we all expect and hope for.
I would like to make a request to everyone, no matter what side of the House you are on, that certain debates taking place in all the Member States of the European Union should not be escalated to European level, and in that way prevent us from achieving our objectives at that level.
We must now achieve the great and ambitious objectives before us.
(Applause from the right)
Let me spell this out clearly: my group will be monitoring the Italian Presidency objectively, fairly and in a spirit of constructive criticism, just as it does with every presidency.
Sometimes people have no sense of symbolism. However, I am very aware of all the competent people representing Italy not just here in Parliament, but also in the European Council and on the Commission: you yourself, Mr President-in-Office, Mr Fini, who has represented you in the Convention and played an important part in its work, Mr Frattini, Italy's Foreign Minister, Mr Buttiglione, Italy's Minister for Europe, the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, and last but not least the Italian Commissioner Mario Monti.
I was very pleased that your own comments and those of the Commission President were in agreement.
Just at the moment we cannot help thinking about 25 March 1957, when the Rome Treaties were signed on the Capitol in Rome.
You now have the fantastic task - some might see it as a burden, but it really is a splendid opportunity - of making your own contribution by means of specific actions, so that at the end of this year we will be able to say that we have the European Constitution of Rome, which will then be signed in Rome, on the Capitol perhaps, by when the ten new countries from central and southern Europe, that is Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus and their citizens will belong to the European Union.
What a great moment in history!
I do not know if I should offer your Foreign Minister, Mr Frattini, my condolences or congratulations on the fact that in the coming weeks and months he will have the enormous task, reporting to you, Mr President-in-Office, of carrying out the practical work needed to achieve that goal.
Let me reassure the Italian Presidency and all our friends in Italy that my group will do its utmost to ensure that this will be a great success and that we will be able to achieve a European Constitution.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President-in-Office, I would specifically like to thank you for repeating here today - and I think that this involved a departure from your written text - what you said last week in Rome to the Conference of Presidents. You said that you would ensure that, when Heads of State and Government meet, then our own President will of course also be present, and that representatives of the European Parliament will also be present when the foreign ministers meet to discuss the constitution.
I would like to thank you for that assurance, but we will be watching to make sure that this actually happens.
I would like to repeat the sincere thanks I addressed yesterday to our representatives in the Praesidium of the Convention, IÃ±igo MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Klaus HÃ€nsch, for the excellent work they have done.
My thanks to them also go to all the Members of this House who have participated in the Convention, including the chairman of our group in the Convention, Elmar Brok.
We trust that, with Parliament's support, it will now be possible to achieve a result by the end of the year.
Mr President-in-Office, you talked about strong European institutions.
Yesterday, in the presence of the President of the Italian Parliament, Ferdinando Casini, of Helmut Kohl, Honorary Citizen of Europe, of the French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, and of many others, we celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of our group, and it was made clear once again that we, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, stand for a Community of Europe, because we know that a return to mere cooperation between governments would be a step backwards.
That is why Europe's institutions need to be strong, and in the final analysis that must be the outcome of the debate on the constitution.
We know at the same time that we Europeans have our roots in our home countries, in our own regions, and that our European citizenship flows from our nationalities and the countries from which we come.
A strong European Union does not therefore conflict with our home countries - it complements them.
Unfortunately I do not have as much speaking time as the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission.
(Laughter and heckling)
I therefore wish to limit myself to just one more point.
Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned infrastructure projects.
We will be looking at that very carefully. But we will also be asking ourselves this question: will the stability of the euro, which also needs to be represented abroad - and I particularly agree with you about that, Mr Prodi - be undermined by this?
We do not want that to happen.
We want to defend a strong euro and the stability of our new European currency.
In conclusion I would like to say, Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, that we wish both you personally and your much-loved country, Italy, a resounding success.
We also and above all wish that success for the sake of the European Union.
I am delighted that my Socialist friends agree - if you can continue along those lines we will be able to talk about a shared success.
If we can achieve that, it will for evermore be written in our history books that on 16 April 2003, 10 countries in Central and Southern Europe signed the accession treaties, and we will then have a European Constitution, signed in Rome, with effect from 1 May 2004.
I wish you every success with that, and my group will continue to follow you along that path in a spirit of constructive criticism.
(Applause from the right)
For a man with limited speaking time you did well!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office of the Council began by talking about Italy's historic role in European construction.
I am going to speak to him frankly on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists: we want Italy and its Presidency to present a bella figura, which succeeds, rather than a brutta figura, which fails.
What worries us is that, when we hear President Ciampi talk about Europe, we feel more reassured, but when we hear President Berlusconi talk about Europe we feel more concerned.
Today you have taken the Ciampi line.
The problem is when you tell us that the Commission must be abolished and that Russia and Israel must join the European Union tomorrow morning.
We agree that the Convention has produced a historic result. If you will allow me, Mr President, I will remind you of the first sentence of the preamble of the Constitution produced by the Convention, which was written 2 500 years ago and is still relevant - it is our fundamental creed - and it is a quotation from Thucydides: 'Our Constitution ... is called a democracy because power is in the hands not of a minority but of the greatest number'.
(Applause from the left)
This means that we are obliged to make laws for the general interest and not to resolve specific cases involving a minority.
That is the cornerstone of European construction.
(Applause from the left)
With regard to the Convention and the Constitution, I have taken good note of the fact that you have expressed a will to negotiate.
I would like to say that we, who would improve the text of the Convention, believe that there must only be formulations of a technical nature, in other words, negotiation over outstanding problems, and that the Constitution must not be rewritten and, in particular, not be moved backwards.
You have made a proposal on the participation of Parliament.
I am grateful for this, but I would like to say one thing to you: this is what we have had since the Treaty of Amsterdam, and even since the Treaty of Maastricht, that the President can attend European Councils and the conclaves, that we have representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference - we call them observers, but we want representatives.
Now there is something else, however.
The Convention has taken place.
The doors cannot be closed.
What we are also asking - and I hope that Parliament will approve this in its resolution - is that the Presidency should be obliged to provide information regularly, here and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, chaired by Giorgio Napolitano, and that we should be able to invite, as we do, representatives from national parliaments.
Yesterday we spoke about this with President Casini and we agree, because what we cannot do is return to diplomacy behind closed doors.
You have also talked about the European economy.
I was surprised that you did not refer to the Lisbon strategy, because what you have talked about is largely the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
But in relation to the so-called 'Tremonti' proposal, which is a resurrection of the Delors plan and the van Miert proposal, it is good to hear from conservative politicians and conservative governments that a degree of Keynesianism is acceptable, because we have been asking for this plan for ten years.
Well, let us see how we can do so, how you will apply the 'golden rule'?
(Applause from the left)
?how guarantees will be established ... even you, who are a successful businessman, could begin by making a first subscription to the bridge of Messina which would overcome the division between Scylla and Charybdis, which has been fundamental to European history over the last 3 000 years.
With regard to the issue of intergenerational solidarity and the future of the welfare state, it is true that we must talk about pensions.
I do not believe that you are proposing that Social Security and pensions should become a European competence - that would go further than what we are saying - but it is important that it be linked to our demographic situation and our future, above all in relation to immigration.
There was recently a debate on this issue in your government, moreover, between hardliners and advocates of a more intelligent, human policy.
We believe that Thessaloniki has been a very important step.
With regard to another constitutional issue, which concerns us because it was a resolution approved by the whole of this House, including the votes from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: at the end of last year we expressed the need to implement the Charter of Fundamental Rights in relation to freedom of expression and, specifically, in relation to the media at European level, in order to counteract the growing disparity between the national anti-concentration rules and in order to guarantee the rights of the citizens.
This is a Green Paper which was produced by the Commission ten years ago and has yet to bear fruit.
We believe it is important - given the prospect of an enlarged Europe and in the interests of guaranteeing these fundamental rights - that we work on this. I would also point out, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that this does not bear any relation to an issue we faced when you were a Member of Parliament: the issue of the waiving of immunity in relation to a case in my country.
What we are proposing is the development of a constitutional right for all Europeans.
Finally, Mr President, I will refer to foreign policy.
If you continue the work of the Greek Presidency with regard to transatlantic relations, we would consider that to be positive and we also believe that an important role can be played through the Quartet in the Middle East.
I would ask you to act like Mrs Rice, that is, when you go to the Middle East, not to talk only to the Israelis.
She has had no problem talking to everybody. Why should an important European have such a problem?
I very much appreciate what you have said in relation to Latin America, which is also a transatlantic issue, and above all in relation to Mercosur.
I will end by thanking you for your generosity and by talking about Italians: when the Treaty of Rome 'II' is signed at the Campidoglio, I am sure that my group colleague and Mayor of Rome, Mr Veltroni, will be very happy to receive the Italian President-in-Office of the Council.
I can assure you, Mr Berlusconi, that we will not be partisan and we will judge your Presidency on the facts, on what you can do, and not just on promises.
(Applause)
Mr President-in-Office, until last night your programme was available only on your website and only in Italian and it is still now available only in Italian and English.
While I have the good fortune to use a computer and to read both languages, some colleagues do not.
I hope this is not a presage.
Your primary task will be to convene the IGC to examine the draft Constitution.
My group shares your ambition to finish this work as soon as possible, and in good time before next year's elections.
We trust that you will provide adequate representation of the European and national parliaments whose involvement in the Convention helped make it such a success.
But the future of Europe is up to the Member States.
If they continue to fight over it, it will be not a Treaty of Rome - not even a Treaty of Dublin - but perhaps a Treaty of Utrecht, representing peace through exhaustion.
Liberal Democrats agree with your priorities on the European economy.
Our economy is in a bad way; the German motor of European growth is stalling.
So initiatives to revive growth are welcome.
Yet the completion of the trans-European transport networks must be viewed as a means to an economic end - the smoother functioning of the internal market - and not as an end in itself.
As a British Liberal, I am delighted by the fidelity of your programme to John Maynard Keynes, and my delight is matched only by my surprise.
However, I hope you agree that the spending you propose on TENs and on defence must be compatible with Member States' commitments under the Stability Pact, which is already under great strain.
For Liberals the continuing value of Keynes lies in his insistence on solidarity.
Your programme speaks much of consumers, but we are citizens first and foremost.
Market ideology tricks people into equating buying power with voting power, and it robs us of the civic freedom by which we control the social consequences of our private choices.
Where regulation is needed is where the gains from remedying market failure for citizens or the environment outweigh the costs of government intervention.
In Italian political debate this is the difference between liberalismo, in which we believe, and liberismo, which we very much reject.
My group supports the closer cooperation you propose with countries around the new borders of the EU, but we should not offer false hope of membership to our neighbours.
Closer relations with the Union must be linked to democracy, respect for human rights and development of a market economy.
We particularly welcome your emphasis on the Euro-Med partnership, which has long been a Liberal priority, and your plans for Albania, where Italy can surely show a lead.
Your programme's proposals on transatlantic relations, which are on the mend after the breakdown caused by the crisis over Iraq, and your aim to rebuild ties with America are welcome.
However, while seeking common ground with the United States, we must not shy from speaking up for Europe's interests where we disagree, and we welcome the strength of your statement on the International Criminal Court
On the Middle East too, the Union must project its voice in the Quartet strongly and clearly.
Assistance in rebuilding the Palestinian economy must be conditional on action against terrorism, as improved cooperation with Israel must be conditional on progress in implementing the road map, notably on dismantling settlements.
On agriculture and on immigration, Liberal Democrats find much less in common with your priorities.
These two policy areas are linked.
You say very little in your programme about CAP reform and yet at present every cow in Europe gets a subsidy of EUR 2 a day, while one billion of our fellow citizens worldwide must survive on less than EUR 1 a day.
Unless we open our markets to farm produce from developing countries, their people will vote with their feet.
The policies you propose on justice and home affairs seek mainly to prevent immigration.
They will not work because you cannot beat the law of supply and demand which operates in labour markets like elsewhere.
When you tell us you are concerned about Europe's reputation 'Cercheremo di fare bella figura per l'Europa', lei ha detto, please bear in mind that white Caucasians are in a minority on our planet.
We hope that you will be guided in justice and home affairs by the balanced approach of the Greek Presidency, rather than by the tenor of Seville.
Mr President-in-Office, your country assumes the presidency following a highly successful Hellenic Presidency, marked by the search for compromise and agreement.
Liberal Democrats in this House hope that in your tenure in the Chair you will, in your words and actions, respect the dignity of the office and honour Italy's traditional European vocation.
Mr President, a number of us feel a particular affection for Italy, for the extraordinary vitality of its society, the creativity of its people, its exceptional cultural heritage and the richness of its local, socially aware democracy.
We love the Italy of the great popular demonstrations demanding employment, social justice and equality; of the vigorous anti-war movement; of the socially aware demonstrations in Genoa against social and police violence; and of the European Social Forum in Florence. It is an Italy that is young, demanding, enthusiastic and combative because it is convinced, as emphasised by its main watchword, that another Europe is possible and because it is determined to bring it about.
This other Europe is one which provides itself with the resources to loosen the grip of neo-liberal globalisation in order to make employment, training, retirement and social welfare more secure for its citizens, to guarantee proper public services and to improve the standard of living - in short, to place people's lives above the demands of the market.
This other Europe is one founded upon ethics and equality before the law, one that banishes elitism and exclusion, prohibits privileges and submission and eradicates the poison of intolerance, racism and xenophobia from within our societies, as well as from Europe's relations with the rest of the world.
This other Europe is one emancipated from US tutelage and daring to make another voice heard in the great international institutions in order, together with its allies from the South, to tackle the open wounds that make the planet less and less safe and habitable and that go under the names of poverty, underdevelopment, environmental disaster and war.
Like ourselves, this fine, unbiddable Italy does not identify with current European Union trends.
With all the more reason, it is disgusted by the policies of those in government in Rome who are carrying European trends to the point of absurdity.
Their neo-liberalism is unrestrained, their Atlanticism unconditional and their taste for democracy rather half-hearted.
One of the priorities of this Presidency is a mammoth project to develop infrastructure.
This would warrant careful examination on a case-by-case basis, for blatant needs do, in fact, exist, like that for a 'piggyback programme' on a scale appropriate to the EU.
Relying upon private capital to carry out such work that will only be profitable in the very long term is, however, to head towards certain failure in the areas of employment, growth and quality of services.
Another of this Presidency's priorities is to force the pace at which advantages in terms of pensions and social welfare are dismantled. This is the trademark of the most conservative forces.
As for the plans relating to immigration and the right of asylum, which need to be finalised in the course of the next six months, revulsion is the only possible response to the idea that this ultra-sensitive debate might be sullied by the barbarous cries of rage to which one of the personalities in the current coalition is frequently given.
We finally learned yesterday that formal decisions will have to be taken between now and December concerning the EU's new strategic doctrine which, when outlined before the start of the Italian Presidency, had already elicited great fears.
Therefore, extreme vigilance will be required in all respects throughout these six months.
If the current constitutional process is to have any meaning, let us begin by ensuring compliance with Article 2 of the draft Constitution, devoted to the values of the EU and worded as follows: 'The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
These values are common to the Member States in a society of pluralism, tolerance, justice, solidarity, and non-discrimination'.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, as we know, Europe is a continent of widely differing peoples and cultures, but one thing is certain: there is nothing surprising in the concern which has greeted your arrival at the helm of the Union.
Italy is tainted with a stain which could well spread to the rest of the new Union: an extraordinary concentration of power, primarily economic and media power but also political power, which has placed you in a position, inter alia, where you are now above the law.
However, we realise that just continually protesting will not suffice: we prefer to act.
During these six months too, we will continue to urge the Commission to respect its undertaking to present a communication on the degree of pluralism of the media in the Union and to fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties.
Indeed, we feel that Italy is rather hesitant, so to speak, when it comes to enforcing the 'Television without Frontiers' directive.
We have fought to have pluralism included among the founding values of the new European Constitution, so that the lack of a legal basis can no longer be used as an excuse not to take action in Europe regarding media concentration and pluralism.
At a time of economic crisis, it is usual to endeavour to find ways of boosting the economy.
We know that Italy has extremely creative ministers who are anxious to expound their ambitious plans for bridges, tunnels and motorways at European level.
We are ready to enter into constructive dialogue on TENs and the role of the EIB, but we must be under no illusion.
It is not true that only three of the 14 projects decided on at Essen were executed because of a lack of funds: if there were not enough investors, one reason is that the appropriateness, socio-economic viability and - we would add -environmental sustainability of many of those projects were not guaranteed.
We must recapture the spirit of the Delors plan and two powerful principles contained in the Commission's White Paper on Transport Policy, which I am afraid we sometimes all appear to disregard: investments must serve not just to fill Europe with infrastructure but to promote economic and social cohesion too.
We must banish the idea that economic growth must of necessity go hand in hand with transport growth, for, otherwise, we will soon find ourselves stuck in a permanent traffic jam.
It makes no sense to spend EUR 6 billion on the Messina bridge to shorten journeys by half an hour when thousands of Sicilians are without drinking water and it takes three hours to complete a 100-km journey by train.
It makes no sense to invest 15 years of work in a 54-km tunnel for the Turin-Lyons link, drilling a hole through a mountain full of asbestos, when modernising and enhancing the present line would make it possible to absorb twice as much freight traffic in five years.
We do not want to discuss grandiose projects which may not be achievable - we want investment which promotes innovation, renewable energies and land regeneration with regard to which the participation and acceptance of the citizens living in the areas concerned are seen as an asset rather than an annoying obstacle.
President-in-Office, your European programme states clearly in black and white that we must open a new season and that we must combat environmental bureaucracies.
This is an interesting circumlocution, which we believe refers to the desire to extend to Europe a principle which is in great vogue in Italy - total deregulation.
We will oppose this attempt to export Italian produce, which is particularly risky at the time of enlargement, for it directly serves the policy of making everything subservient to infrastructure and is based on an antiquated concept of the environment as a commodity to be used and sold off.
Italy is second only to Spain when it comes to breaches of environment legislation.
Your government, President-in-Office, has changed the laws on waste so as to make monitoring more difficult, even though 11 million tonnes of waste are lost without trace and the turnover of the ecomafia is estimated to be around EUR 2.5 billion every year in Italy.
It has weakened the laws on the assessment of environmental impact so much that it has become purely a formality. It has consented to the indiscriminate promotion of hunting in parks by regional authorities.
For this year, it has appropriated EUR 56 million for protected areas, which is less than the cost of building 1 km of motorway tunnel.
It is preparing to decriminalise environmental offences across the board.
In all this, it is disregarding Community law.
In this matter too, as in the issue of the media, we feel that this is a situation specific to Italy.
President Prodi, in a sector in which the Union has genuine competences and international responsibilities, we fear that the unnecessarily complicated infringement procedure is no longer sufficient, and that by maintaining an excessively tolerant attitude and giving more consideration to the details of form than to substance we are in serious danger of helping to render Community legislation on the environment completely ineffective.
President-in-Office, as regards foreign policy, we would all like to benefit from your excellent relations with President Bush, but certainly not to organise an impossible contest in military expenditure, maybe reducing contributions to development cooperation organisations in order to fund the Italian presence in Iraq.
A fundamental dispute has arisen with the Bush administration over the International Criminal Court.
We would like to know, President-in-Office, whether you are going to press ahead with and update the action plan for the Court, which was adopted in May 2002.
Then you are on excellent terms with President Putin.
Once again, it is our genuine hope that we will all be able to benefit from this friendship.
You have listed all the countries in the world: how can you forget Chechnya?
We need incisive action to bring about resolution of this conflict.
We must adopt an initiative, and we will support you if you do so, with a view to convening a regional conference for the Caucasus in which all the current conflicts can be addressed without fail.
Moreover, President-in-Office, we believe that we and you would be proud if you succeeded in persuading President Putin to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.
One final word on the European Constitution.
We will support the Italian Presidency's endeavours to achieve a short Intergovernmental Conference so as not to disperse the - moreover, few - positive results of the Convention. However, President-in-Office, you must keep nuclear energy out of the Constitution, and I call upon the deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fini, to help us keep it out.
Just as for GMOs, it would be unwise to underestimate the negative reaction of the citizens of many European countries, Italy included, when faced with the explicit promotion of such a costly, dangerous source of energy, as is currently contained in the Constitution.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, a constantly-changing society demands from politics new debates, the ability to take rapid decisions and, above all, the willingness to reflect deeply, with full knowledge of the facts, on the geopolitical and different economic and cultural situations which, in some respects, contribute to the ever-widening gap between north and south and between citizens.
As a member of the Convention, I would like to express my satisfaction and the satisfaction of the Group which I have the honour of representing in that forum - the Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations - with a text which recognises the value of the national States in the new European Union: a Union which we hope will have stronger and more transparent institutions after the Intergovernmental Conference, which can prove to the world that the European Union exists as a model of civilisation and development. A civilisation which wants to see its values recognised without wishing to abuse the values of other cultures; development which must be compatible with the rate of adaptation of man.
It is our hope that, with regard to the preamble, the Intergovernmental Conference will come to an agreement on the acknowledgement of the roots from which the Union has sprung to life.
The ancient history of Greece and Rome, the Judaeo-Christian traditions and the secular, liberal values which came gradually to be established cannot be disregarded because it is from them that the future of Europe is drawing cultural and moral strength.
We can see, moreover, that it would be appropriate to reflect once again on the need for there to be a European Commissioner for each Member State, in order to achieve greater cohesion between all the institutions.
The Constitutional Treaty will, at last, give rise to a politically cohesive, free, independent Europe which respects the languages and traditions of each nation.
The Italian Presidency has some extremely arduous tasks ahead of it and we are confident that, in the spirit of cooperation that it will foster with the other European institutions, with the Members of the European Parliament, the elected representatives of the people, it will give fresh impetus to the process of unifying Europe and to Europe's role in the world.
The urgency of the migration issue demands an overall view.
As I had occasion to write on the eve of the Thessaloniki Summit, only Europe, not least through a new Mediterranean policy and, at last, adopting a new principle of cooperation with the poorest countries, will be able to stop illegal migration of biblical proportions becoming a collective tragedy.
I look forward to the European border police corps and the new agreements with third countries, I look forward to reinforced cooperation in combating organised crime, terrorism and fundamentalism, but the issue of a European approach to the globalisation of the markets must be addressed too, to prevent cultures and traditions becoming fragmented and dying out.
A healthy social market economy cannot continue to accommodate unrestrained financial speculation such as that we have witnessed in recent years, which has broken out intermittently without there being any attempt to destroy its roots, to eradicate its causes.
The health of the economy also depends on the parameters governing our actions, and one good parameter is that the financial economy must move at the same rate as the real economy.
Europe cannot disregard the fact that the mobility necessary to allow the economy to develop further is dependent on two requirements: cultural education, which provides young people of all nations with the basis for mutual understanding - which means the national governments will have to address the need to provide more and better information on the activities of the European institutions - and the question of accommodation, which cannot be the responsibility solely of individuals or the private sector but to which the institutions too must help to find a solution; likewise, infrastructure- and transport-related issues need solutions at both national and European level, and so we would point out again here the need for rapid completion of Corridor 5 and Corridor 8.
To combat the new forms of poverty which are emerging increasingly in the countries of the Union, we feel that it is vital for Europe to have a stronger energy policy which, based on seeking new sources and more efficient use of known sources, goes hand in hand with preserving those environmental values without which the very life of the planet would be endangered.
At the same time, the issue of funding for research must be addressed: without substantial increases European research will not reach a level of excellence, with all the predictable ensuing consequences.
In this connection, a more effective European food safety policy becomes particularly important in order to safeguard the quality of products and to protect their origins, thus safeguarding the citizens' health, which is the Union's main asset.
Today, Europe is called upon not just to uphold the right to life of its citizens and of all human beings but to send out the message that all people have the right to a dignified life.
Indeed, in the third millennium, all the most highly developed communities are, in any case, being called upon to take the political, cultural and economic measures necessary both within and outside their states to ensure that the tragedies we are witnessing do not continue.
Children in Afghanistan currently have the lowest life expectancy in the world.
Like millions of other children - in Africa, South America and the Middle and Far East - they are deprived of the right to life and the right to a dignified life.
The relentless combating of terrorism and the consolidation of peace are dependent, not least, upon Europe's ability to deliver what it has promised over the course of recent years: the right to a dignified life, Mr President, not least in order to put an end to practices involving physical mutilation, to which many women are subjected in their countries of origin, suffering this abuse in Europe too.
The Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations also expects from the Italian Presidency policies seeking to combat forms of discrimination, to crack down on traffickers of arms and human beings and to destroy the arcane, yet powerful world of child abuse.
These criminal organisations have unrestricted, unregulated use of the Internet, which they use to spread their evil culture throughout the world.
We therefore call for the drawing up of rules to stop a tool which exists to facilitate communication between citizens being transformed into a tool for use by those who violate the laws of the national states of the Union.
In order to stop this happening, every technological invention must be subject to a European screening process, a scientific experimental control process which provides the guarantee that it is safe to use.
Mr President, if freedom is to be true freedom, there have to be rules: a small number of clear, enforced rules.
We appeal to these rules in the hope that the Italian Presidency will enjoy today the good will and cooperation of the European Parliament, the Group of the Union for a Europe of Nations and of all 25 countries which make up our great Europe.
