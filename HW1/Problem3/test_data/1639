By contrast, we are fiercely â that is no doubt too strong a word â opposed to the amendments tabled by our Italian fellow Members, namely Amendments Nos 19, 23, 26, 27 and 29, which aim to propose a system of contractual rules rather than a European electronic toll system.
We believe that there must be a European electronic toll system.
It is clearer from the legal point of view, and it is also more stable, simpler and easier to understand.
We shall therefore oppose these Italian proposals.
By contrast, we are entirely in agreement with Amendment No 39 which seeks to protect privacy, since we are proposing a switch to Galileo.
It seems to us that these precautions are necessary.
Finally, we shall approve and support Amendment No 40 tabled by the Verts/ALE Group, because we believe that a toll cannot amount to nothing more than a tax or an additional charge.
Nor can a toll be simply a means of covering the depreciation of our road infrastructure.
A toll must also be a transport-policy tool, and must be able to guarantee modal transfer and cross-financing, so as to encourage people to switch to other alternative modes of transport in future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by praising the rapporteur for a really good piece of work.
At the moment, we see how more and more EU countries are introducing road tolls, often backed by different technical systems.
This is one of the main points I believe we should emphasise, namely that we must not focus exclusively upon one technical system, such as satellite navigation, but, on the contrary, permit different systems that are interoperable.
It is enough to look at the situation in Germany, which has come down unilaterally in favour of a particular system which is patently not operating as intended.
That is not an example we should follow at EU level.
In connection with the German system, there was also another problem, namely that there were not enough boxes available, with the result that hauliers in different countries did not have the opportunity to have these boxes installed.
There is also something else we must avoid in the future.
I think that, in order to be focused upon its users, the system must also ensure, at a purely technical level, that hauliers and their drivers only have to install a single box in each vehicle.
This would ease the administrative burden for the transport companies, and it would also mean greater road safety, for drivers would only have to concentrate on one piece of equipment.
It is also important that users be guaranteed access to a coherent network through a single contract relating to the overall network of roads involving tolls.
Together, these are all aspects it is very important to bear in mind in connection with the reading of this report.
I therefore hope we obtain an agreement that puts users in the driving seat.
I also hope you have noticed that I have left a little time for those who, unlike myself, have exceeded their speaking time.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I have to say again that I do not agree with the Commissioner, and that this report is indeed very much about the Eurovignette, among other things.
The fact is that the introduction of a Eurovignette is dependent on the interoperability of toll systems, which means that the technology must be available, and work, before we can start charging for the Eurovignette, and we all know how urgently we need the money.
We know that there is a considerable shortfall of funds in the railway sector.
We saw, indeed, in our most recent debates on the necessary size of the European Unionâs budgets, that there is in this sector a need for both revenue and for costs to be apportioned realistically, in other words, that railways, which have to pay their way, must, as regards costs, be put on an equal footing with roads, and that HGVs and other freight traffic must also pay to use roads.
So we unreservedly back Mrs Sommer as regards the guidelines she has laid down and endorse her statement that we need a solution that is not dependent on technology.
The aim is that the technology that is used should be capable of being used anywhere, and soon.
That is what we are aiming for, and it is a very good thing that Parliament is sticking to this line.
Thank you, Mrs Sommer: we need a practicable solution, and we are right behind you.
The introduction of the actual instrument that we need â the Eurovignette, an instrument of policy that this admittedly highly technical report is seeking to bring about â is absolutely dependent on a practicable solution being found.
Speaking, then, as a representative of a government that has shown how not to do it, I can say that the Greens â and I am absolutely of one mind with the German Greens on this â see practicability as the decisive factor in a solution.
Let me warn you, Commissioner, against going all-out for big technology that does not always work, and neglecting the other practical aspects.
I believe that Mrs Sommerâs report imposes the right conditions and shows it has to be done.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make use of the opportunity afforded by the discussion of this report to underline the distinction that should continue to be drawn between the harmonisation of toll collection systems and the uniform collection of tolls as tax.
I am, on the one hand, referring to the technical aspects that are being discussed and whereby it is intended to achieve interoperability of electronic toll collection systems across the Union.
Nobody in their right mind will be opposed to this.
It does, however, strike me that this report steers clear of a few important political issues that have arisen during the discussion of this topic, and so a more comprehensive discussion would have been desirable.
I would particularly emphasise the fact that it should remain up to the Member States themselves to assess the desirability of a toll system for lorries and passenger cars.
It seems rather logical to me that in a peripheral or insular state, such as Portugal, or Malta, which is due to accede in the near future, the economic and political considerations there are different from those in, for example, Flanders, which, being situated between Germany, France, the Netherlands and Great Britain, forms the EUâs central traffic intersection.
The Flemish motorways are at risk of being oversaturated by the exponential increase in freight traffic.
In order to stimulate transport by rail and sea, for example, Flanders should be able to use criteria that are different from those of other Member States, if it wanted to introduce toll collections for freight traffic tomorrow, because it collects no tolls at present.
The same applies to toll collections on passenger transport, whereby so many different factors, including tourism, traffic density, air pollution, economic structures, and so on, can play a role in determining whether or not such toll collections are desirable.
Every government should retain the right to weigh up for itself whether the already heavily taxed car drivers â and we are talking about working people who keep the wheels of industry oiled â should be taxed even more.
Today, Europe may harmonise the technical aspects of â and I should like to drive this point home â toll systems.
When it comes to making political and economic decisions in this respect, this Parliament and the Commission would do well to show a little more respect for the subsidiarity principle, to which often only lip service is paid.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to add my congratulations to those that have already been made to the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in revising some of the more unrealistic parts of the proposal.
However, there are for me a number of concerns which still remain and which still need further clarification.
One of my main concerns centred on the familiar subject of subsidarity, already mentioned by the previous speaker.
In this particular case, I do not believe that the EU should be able to foist road pricing upon the UK, or any other EU country for that matter, and I am therefore pleased to see an amendment guaranteeing the subsidiarity principle in this report.
Thus it is now clear that the proposal should not imply the mandatory EU-wide introduction of toll systems.
Such a move would doubtless mean, for example, that the UK Government, which is currently considering road pricing, would simply have passed the buck for such an unpopular move on to the European Union.
I am also pleased to see that we are to let the markets dictate what technology, if any, should be used.
The notion that a satellite technology system would be our sole system is to me quite ridiculous.
Indeed, it is the proposal to use satellite technology which irks me most.
I have argued several times in committee that civil liberties issues that accompany this particular type of technology are a grave threat to people's everyday lives.
We all know that, improperly used, satellite tracking is just another form of Big Brother.
There is also the not insubstantial cost to business and individuals, who presumably would have to pay for the installation of such technology.
On a more positive note, the committee's decision to put back the Commission's implementation dates was very much welcome.
The original request was both highly illogical and unrealistic.
But regrettably, unless the issues to which I have referred are fully addressed, in particular the reference to the use of satellite systems, I will be unable to support the rapporteur in her overall proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by congratulating Mrs Sommer on her very thorough and in-depth work, although I admit that I would have preferred a report that stuck closer to what the Commission had proposed.
I believe that the Commission proposal was â or is â bolder and more forward-looking, albeit somewhat more risky.
Unfortunately, I have to add, the Commissionâs staff have perhaps been insufficiently energetic or enthusiastic in pleading the technical merits of this proposal.
We can certainly live with what Mrs Sommer has put together and the Committee have adopted, but I would like to point out that it would actually do the Europeanâs image some good if it were to move towards the most modern technology, not just because the technology is the most up-to-date, but because it is highly flexible.
Advocates of a toll system, at any rate, know how important tolls can be in regulating traffic flow and diverting traffic from overstretched or environmentally vulnerable areas to other routes.
They know that a high degree of flexibility is needed, one that can be achieved only by means of satellite technology, which requires less in the way of infrastructure than if a toll system uses microwave technology.
I will concede that the bad experiences that the Germans are currently having have not been much help in achieving acceptance of this principle.
That is one reason why Mrs Sommer, who may indeed have been more in favour of such a system, could not plead its cause, as she always had one eye on the press reports from Germany and could not go any further.
I will address my concluding remarks to the Commission, which will perhaps report to one of the forthcoming meetings of the Committee on Regional Policy Transport and Tourism on what is happening about Galileo and the satellite system.
I started by describing the Commission proposal as bolder but rather more risky â the latter insofar as we are dependent on a satellite system, Galileo in particular.
It appears to me that there will be major problems with using the satellite-based system in Europe, for I hear that the Americans are bringing certain pressure to bear â we are having separate and specific talks with them â concerning the American influence on the system, which is being made somewhat less precise, and can, if it comes to that, even be switched off.
I do not know whether the Commissioner wants to say something about this at the end of this debate or whether she will be able, when next the opportunity arises, to report to the committee on the actual state of play in this area.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I should like first of all to thank MrsÂ Sommer for the huge amount of work that has been done.
I should like to revisit the objective of this directive, which is, of course, the interoperability of electronic toll collection systems.
It is, however, abundantly clear that the real objective goes deeper than this, namely the internalisation of the external environmental costs.
Amendments have been tabled to that effect.
After all, the key problems surrounding traffic still exist.
Now, more than four years after I entered this House, those discussions are still going on.
The problems are obvious: the environment, noise, emissions, congestion, lack of safety â I could go on in this vein for some time.
These problems are inextricably linked to economic growth.
Nearly all transport economists are in agreement that the use of tolls to restrict and influence traffic is the only way to tackle that problem.
Todayâs headlines in the Netherlands read: âTolls at different levels help counter tailbacksâ.
This is the theory, but the heart of the problem, does, of course, lie to some extent with the Council of Ministers.
At the beginning of this month, we received the report from the Council of Ministers that the ministers and transport ministers, at all levels, are hopelessly undecided about collection on a per-kilometre basis.
I heard the proposals from Mrs Peijs, formerly an MEP, and currently Transport Minister in the Netherlands, which are tantamount to âflat-rate collectionâ.
What we need is collection based on price, location, and type of vehicle and on a whole list of other things.
This requires modern technology.
We nonetheless share the rapporteurâs view that, at present, we should not simply, , ditch such things as microwave communication.
That is taking matters too far.
I also think that we are taking matters one step too far by using this so-called Galileo technology.
Why do we insist on doing this?
GSM and GPS technology already exists, and GPS2 is only around the corner.
The discussion surrounding Galileo is sufficiently known; we have had it here too.
What we are about to receive now, is a sort of truck system, which I do not regard as strictly necessary.
If we look at the examples in Switzerland, and at the , and so on, we conclude that we require an abundance of forward-looking technology.
In my opinion, we should not only have Galileo, but also perhaps GSM.
It should also be compatible, as we have agreed before.
We would make a great deal of progress with this, and we hope that we can solve this future problem.
I urge the transport ministers in any case to speak out about the way in which we use the money, whether we transfer money or not, what we collect for, for example, improving rail systems and so on, in other words âcross pricingâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Sommer, whom I would like to thank for your work, I feel that our debates would sometimes be simpler if we were a little more with the order of business.
I agree that this proposal for a directive will serve to simplify and, therefore, to some extent to promote the widespread use of systems of charging by means of tolls, rights of use and other means, but the subject of the directive is not so much charging as the interoperability of the different systems.
For us, this was a goal which really was indispensable, in that only by guaranteeing interoperability can barriers to trade and potential distortions of the internal market be eliminated.
In this sense, what we are doing is not supporting exploitative or technological monopolies but establishing the indispensable need for interoperability.
I have no objection to resolute investment in pioneering technologies or the satellite sector as set out by the rapporteur.
I have listened on a number of occasions to objections relating to the âBig Brotherâ risk.
I am no advocate of âBig Brotherâ, but, quite frankly, I would not like it whatever country it came from.
It would not be right for any of us to be totally indifferent to Mr Bushâs âBig Brotherâ and to be concerned solely about the European âBig Brotherâ, although, clearly, if I have to choose between them, I would choose the European branch of the family.
One last point: the interoperability obligation must apply to contractual regulations too.
We have to make things simpler for users and taxpayers too, with clear rules which make contractual relationships and regulations applying to individual operators flexible and open to common use by all operators.
Legal, fiscal and other barriers make the obligatory reference to a single-contract system more complex.
Â Â  Mr President, the British Labour MEPs fully support the polluter pays principle and, with this in mind, believe that the cost of motoring in general should better reflect the real costs to society and, in particular, the environment.
This can be best achieved by the introduction, where appropriate and where there is local support, of charging schemes.
Congestion charging plays a key role in combating congestion, pollution and global warming.
The successful and popular Central London charging scheme is an example of this new approach and represents the most ambitious urban road pricing scheme in Europe.
Other towns and cities in the UK are pursuing similar initiatives.
For lorries, Labour in the UK advocates the introduction of a lorry user charge, which is to be introduced in 2006 and, incidentally, is strongly supported by the main haulage-trade associations.
Therefore, whilst we fully support the principle of interoperability of toll systems, it is essential that these pioneering British initiatives are not in any way prejudiced.
We therefore support EU action to agree minimum technical standards to permit interoperability of tolling technology, so as to avoid vehicle owners having to install a number of separate units, with obvious consequences regarding cost and inconvenience.
However, it would be wrong to prescribe the type of technology.
We therefore welcome the Sommer report and would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, which fully addresses these concerns, seeking compatibility rather than rigidly prescribing the type of technology, which should rightly be left to the market or, under the principle of subsidiarity, to Member States.
One area where there could be clarification is the role of regional and local authorities, and we urge Members to support Amendment No 45, which makes it clear that is the appropriate level for decision-making in some cases.
We also advocate support for Amendment No 44, which seeks to clarify that onboard equipment is not compulsory.
Finally, let us all make it clear that if we adopt this report tomorrow we are not forcing Member State or local authority to charge motorists or hauliers.
We are reasonably and sensibly seeking to ensure compatibility between schemes.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I wish to congratulate MrsÂ Sommer on the excellent report she has presented and which I fully support.
Like the rapporteur, I believe that the Commission proposal must contribute to the smoother operation of the internal market.
From the usersâ point of view, then, the directive could facilitate toll charging in the various Member States, eliminating waiting times and consequently increasing capacities for infrastructure use.
The current system, specifically as regards international freight hauliers, who might be obliged to acquire separate devices, each with its own contract and to install them in their vehicles, makes no sense at all.
I wish, however, to make a few observations on some points that I feel are relevant and to which, I believe, this House must pay particular attention.
My first point concerns the need to make it perfectly clear that the directive does not affect Member Statesâ freedom to decide on their own system of infrastructure charging for roads.
The directive only covers the charging system and does not include road-charging policy as such.
Furthermore, and as regards the timetable for interoperability, I share the rapporteurâs view that this should start on 1Â January 2007, because this date would guarantee sufficient and necessary time for the industry and those managing infrastructures to define and install equipment that meets the new standards.
Lastly, I wish to emphasise that the directive must not ignore essential elements on which its success depends. These are: creating awareness-raising activities for users as regards technological developments, implementing legal procedures for monitoring and preventing fraud, analysing types of compensation for investments that have been made or which are being made by operators in parallel technological, financial or commercial processes whose viability is threatened by the requirement to switch to the new system.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having removed the structural defect in the Commission proposal, by which I mean the requirement that systems be interoperable before they are abolished, the report points in a direction with which we can all agree, and for that thanks are due to the rapporteur.
Our essential need is for a toll system that is compatible right across Europe and built to a standard that will last into the future.
Europe has, since the 1990s, seen the introduction of a multitude of different toll systems, all stitched together in a patchwork, and there would be many more patches were it not for this directive.
The directive is intended to make it possible, in future, to get right across Europe with one technological item and one contract, and what that means is that the systems will have to be compatible by 2007.
Looking further ahead, it recommends the introduction of a satellite-based toll system and, at the same time, calls on the Commission to submit, by 2009, a strategy for the conversion of the services.
That was what our group had demanded, and I am glad that we have the rapporteurâs backing in this.
Why are we recommending a satellite-based toll system?
We do so because it has the potential to add value to our transport policy.
If I might use a rather laboured analogy, I do not buy a typewriter and then a computer if I am going to be putting my documents on the Internet.

A satellite-based toll system also promises more for the future, firstly, because it can â provided that the political will is present â provide comprehensive and cross-border coverage of vehicles, and, secondly, because â as my colleague Mr Swoboda said â it provides a basis on which future traffic flows can be directed and on which different modes of transport can be logistically interlinked. Thirdly, it will be possible to use it in combination with mobile communications technology as a means towards introducing other services, such as, for example, rapid help in the event of accidents, local hazard warnings and the tracking of dangerous goods, to name but a few.
Perhaps the Commission should have put greater emphasis on these technical considerations.
I would be happy if we could complete this directive within the life of this Parliament; after first reading would be best of all.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have, in Europe, been talking for over twenty years in terms of what we call the new approach.
Now we have another buzzword: the European Union is no longer to regulate every detail of everything, but it is to concentrate primarily on the interoperability of systems.
Unfortunately, though, we often do not adhere to this principle, and that is the problem in this instance, but not with the directive itself, of which there has already been much criticism.
The Commission has proposed a system for the future, admittedly one whose target date is a long way in the distance.
As the Commissioner said, the only thing is that it probably will not work, and that is not what we want.
We need workable systems â note the plural â that must be in place, that must work, and must be interoperable.
I have nothing against satellite technology, and there is much to be said for it, but not when it is like this.
Is the collapse in Germany not enough for us?
What we need right now is technological neutrality, and we will carry on needing it for a number of years.
Looked at from that angle, we must warmly thank our rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, for, at an early stage â which was the right one â steering the committeeâs discussions in the direction that we need, concentrating on the need to guarantee interoperability, above all, too, on making things simpler for the user, and on ensuring that the system can work.
That leads me also to warmly thank Mr Turmes, who was right to warn us against losing our grip on reality when dealing with the topic of tolls and toll systems.
When he started speaking, it almost sounded as if he were already talking about ecopoints, which are the next item on the agenda, but I can agree with him on that and also on what he has said on this item for discussion: we should not get airborne over this.
Let us ensure that there are workable systems for our transport system as a whole, or else we may end up organising some things better, but we will be wrecking many more.
Â Â  Mr President, as my colleague Mr Watts has said, we very much support the principle of interoperability of road charging schemes across Europe, but I particularly want to talk about London.
As an MEP representing London, I obviously have concerns about the way that this report may affect the very successful congestion charge scheme that has been operating in London for the past year or so.
We do not want to jeopardise that scheme in any way and we now have enough assurances from the Commission that our concerns will be taken into account.
However, there are two things I still want to talk about.
One is that, at the moment, the London scheme does not use microwave technology, but may well move towards doing that.
This would require onboard units and will bring the scheme very much under this directive.
If we are then required to move to some kind of satellite system, that really would cause enormous problems, because satellite systems are not designed for urban environments and there would be difficulties of visibility â of actually seeing traffic in the way that is required.
There is also the matter of barriers and, obviously, a city requires a barrier-free environment.
So, if we move to satellite technology there could be very real technical problems in operating it, not only in London but also in other urban environments which may introduce similar schemes.
So we are extremely concerned about this and the effects that this directive might have on what is still a new scheme in London but one that has been extremely successful.
The London congestion charge has reduced significantly the amount of traffic going into the centre, with the obvious benefits for the environment, etc. Therefore, I hope we will get the assurances that we are seeking.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, road tolls are never popular, especially if one is paying them oneself, but they are a fact of life in todayâs Europe all the same.
They are necessary.
It is just a question of how we can minimise the bother they cause and the costs that result.
Various systems have now been introduced at local and national level, but they are not compatible.
Obviously, to avoid problems, they have to be harmonised.
The excellent aim of this Commission proposal is that each and everyone should have just one contract and every vehicle just one box, for the internal market to function properly.
This is only reasonable.
I agree with MrsÂ Sommer that the interoperability of road tolls is the objective, rather than the means of achieving it.
I would disagree somewhat with the Commission: in my opinion, we need to be more flexible as far as local authorities are concerned, because then good, viable schemes already in operation would not have to be scrapped just because satellite systems are being adopted too rapidly.
The fact that the systems should be mutually functional is the goal, not that they should work using microwaves or any other waves.
That is why it is sufficient that general requirements should be determined to achieve the basic object of the directive, which is the interoperability of the systems.
That is crucial.
A dynamic Europe needs road transport.
An ever more affluent Europe needs mobility.
Good though it might be that we standardise these systems, we must also make sure that we keep costs at a reasonable level and do not voluntarily place ourselves in a straitjacket.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President; Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done and also the willingness to engage in dialogue that she has constantly demonstrated while dealing with a portfolio that certainly was not an easy one.
It is of course tempting to talk about tolls as if they were quite self-explanatory, for there are so many aspects to them.
The regulation they provide can benefit the environment; they can promote safety; they also produce income, and one can of course have exciting discussions about what is to be done with it.
I believe, though, that we would be ill-advised to confuse the two issues, as we will have the opportunity to discuss the first of them later on, so let us concentrate on the technology.
Past experience has taught us that discussing this is extremely useful.
We have ourselves seen the chaos that can result if each country insists on using its own recipe for technology, and Toll Collect in Germany was a good example of that.
I do not believe that monopolies provide the answer in this area; we should simply aim to have good technology, and I believe that the Commission proposal and what the rapporteur has suggested are going the right way about achieving this.
The âone contract per userâ principle is, I believe, desirable and will remain so.
Unlike Mrs Honeyball and Mr Watts, I do not live in London, but at a distance of seven kilometres from two countries, and I can tell you that it would be a nightmare for HGV drivers among others if they had to reckon on needing to install in their vehicles a different monitoring system for each country.
That is not on, and I believe that we should, in future, outlaw it.
Secondly, the technology should not be too precisely specified, but should, quite simply, be reliable, efficient and compatible; in other words, its interoperability must be guaranteed.
Past experience has shown us what we have coming to us if these criteria are not met.
In conclusion, then, I hope that, whatever system is introduced, we will not repeat the experience we have had only recently.
Haulage operators sacrificed thousands of working hours in installing systems, only for a country and a region to then decide to do without them.
There is neither point nor purpose to such an exercise, which, I believe, completely fails to achieve something that I regard as a very good thing.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commission proposal deserves Parliamentâs support.
It should be our mission to encourage the taking of still greater steps, but the committeeâs report is a disappointment as far as that is concerned.
Firstly, the committee considers the issue from many angles but does not question the fact that the system only applies to commercial transport.
Secondly, the committee still seems to think that road tolls should cover the costs of road maintenance.
Thirdly, with the approach the committee is proposing the EU will not achieve sufficient lift-off as far as sustainable development is concerned.
I now want to go into rather more detail regarding these three factors.
In the adoption of road toll systems one has to be wary of a situation where an increase in private transport completely cancels out the benefit of a reduction in commercial transport.
The only sustainable solution is for the system to apply to all road transport in the same way right from the start.
This solution is not unfair to private motorists because satellite positioning equipment is rapidly becoming more and more common in cars.
There will be a significant proportion of them by 2008 when the European Galileo system becomes operational.
It is essential to take the external costs of traffic into account so that with any road toll imposed the marginal cost matches the ceiling amount charged.
In this way traffic would not have to pay the present external cost, but one based on a new balanced charge that reflects the volume of traffic.
What should therefore be regarded as the prime objective is that the volume of traffic on a route or in a zone where charges apply is at an optimal level at different times and that what constitutes that optimal level is determined by market mechanisms.
In my view these conditions will be met most easily with satellite positioning systems and that is why we should venture to agree, as the Commission has proposed, to adopt this technology promptly as a basis for a European system.
In this way bringing technology onto the market will also mean large-scale benefits that transport companies above all will enjoy in terms of decreasing costs.
I imagine people are muttering to themselves about the inadequacy of legislative powers.
I would remind them, however, of the ever greater part traffic plays as a producer of carbon dioxide emissions.
Although the car industry, with EU support, has done and is doing important work to develop low emission vehicles there is good reason to introduce road toll systems specifically to reduce emissions.
I refer to Article 174 of the Treaty on European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the rapporteur that it is not the legislatorâs task to impose on the market a particular technology to the exclusion of all others, but, at the end of the day, our interest is in being able, one day, to use the best of the toll charging systems on offer in Europe.
Microwave technology is in competition with satellite positioning and mobile communications, and important amendments now indicate its advantages in comparison with other systems.
To be sure, there are parallel systems over stretches of road, and perhaps not only for a transitional period, but the simple fact is that progressive conversion to satellite positioning and mobile communications technology offers a more realistic prospect of achieving interoperability and hence guaranteeing the absence of problems with road traffic by means of a working system of toll collection and without excessively expensive investments in infrastructure.
We have already heard how, in the sphere of satellite positioning the European satellite navigation system Galileo, which is currently under construction, will, from 2008 onwards, provide information of superior quality to that provided by the present-day GPS and will be ideally suited to telematics services in road traffic.
This is about using the opportunities opened up to us by Galileo in the area of toll charging.
Not in any way, though, is this about using toll-collecting technology as a means of justifying the extension of Galileo.
Let us not make the mistake of taking the disaster that befell the introduction of German lorry tolls as a reason not to give toll charging by satellite a chance.
That would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
It does not follow that there has to be repetition of the financial failures, bad luck and accidents that attended the introduction of the German HGV tolls, so let us keep our cool.
As I have said, I do not favour the mandatory introduction of satellite-based toll charging systems, but I do have confidence that, at the end of the day, the best system will prevail on the market, for that is what is demanded by the interests of the matter in hand.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Sommer, for the wonderful work she has done, and express my gratitude for the discussions and progress which have resulted from the joint work of the three institutions with a view to achieving approval at first reading, because I believe that the objections we had in relation to some of the points which had been adopted in the first report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have been entirely altered by means of certain compromise amendments which are acceptable to the Commission and which I also believe will be acceptable to the Council when the time comes.
I would like to point out that tomorrow, with the ratification by this plenary of the rapporteurâs suggestions, we may see the approval by the Council of Parliamentâs proposal, which â I would insist â the Commission could accept in this form.
Furthermore, I would like to reply briefly to some of the concerns expressed by the honourable Members.
Firstly, with regard to the issue of subsidiarity, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you that this is guaranteed.
What we are essentially proposing is a single legal contract, which allows for a payment for the use of an infrastructure, wherever that use takes place, at the place of origin, from the user's current account.
In other words, for example, just as the charges for the use of a mobile phone or a credit card in any part of the European Union are subsequently charged to our bank accounts, we are trying to create a similar situation for road tolls: that the use of an infrastructure in a third country is charged to our bank account.
This will have to be done by means of contracts and with sufficient guarantees, as in the sectors I have mentioned as examples.
In order to be able to do that not only do we need a single contract but also we need to make progress in order to take full advantage of these conditions in relation to the interoperability and compatibility of systems.
I must say that, despite the fact that Mrs Sommer and certain other speakers have said that it is premature to commit ourselves now to a system â such as the satellite system, which has not been fully tested â and that I believe we could perhaps have made more progress, the final result of the debate we have held is positive.
I also believe that a strong recommendation for the future in favour of the Galileo system sends an appropriate message to the whole sector which is going to invest, which is investing or intends to implement the Galileo system and, therefore, we are providing support for the Galileo system â which is a European system â with the necessary flexibility so that each country can, nevertheless, take the corresponding measures, provided that they are compatible and interoperable, although there may possibly be other solutions in the event that there are, for example, problems relating to investments, the repayment of investments, etc.
To reply very briefly to the question from Mr Swoboda on the negotiations with the United States, I would like to take this opportunity to say that they are moving ahead very positively.
In recent times, in relation to the problem of overlapping of frequencies, we have now fully resolved â in a way which is satisfactory to both parties â the overlapping of code M of the American GPS â which is the maximum security code â with our own signal â the closed security signal, reserved for public authorities within the Galileo system â and we have found formulae which have in no way prejudiced the quality of the Galileo system and which at the same time offer the security guarantees called for by the United States.
It remains for us to resolve the overlapping which occurs â according to the Americans â between our open signal and one of their signals.
We have made it very clear that what we cannot accept is the United Statesâ initial proposal â which means moving from 1Â 5Â 1Â 5 (which is what we would like) to 1 1 (the Americansâ preference) â because we believe the quality of our service would be greatly reduced.
Furthermore, we believe that on 1Â 5 we do not create security problems for the American security system.
In any event, we are bringing these discussions to an end, but I hope, ladies and gentlemen, that no greater difficulties arise and that we will have a complete solution, since almost all the issues have practically been resolved, something I am extremely happy about.
To this we should add the interest expressed by countries such as China, India, Brazil and other third countries in participating in this project.
The next issue I would like to mention very briefly is the case of London, although we could consider other cities.
Ladies and gentlemen, the field in which we demand interoperability and compatibility does not apply to the London toll, amongst other reasons, firstly, because it is a local area, which does not fall within our competences and above all because in London no equipment is installed.
Furthermore, it is pointed out that it would not be applied in cases in which the intended objective implies an excessive or unbalanced cost.
Mr President, I will end by saying that, for the sake of conciseness and in order to ensure precision in an area of a highly technical nature, we believe that we should partially revise the wording â not the substance â of Amendments Nos 2, 14, 18 and 32.
Apart from that, Mr President, it only remains for me to thank Mrs Sommer for her wonderful work and the honourable Members for your cooperation and to sum up by saying that this is the technological system which later on will allow us to appropriately apply the Eurovignette Directive.
Today we are not talking about tolls as such, but of methods for charging tolls more simply, which create fewer problems for the users and which facilitate the operation of the internal market.
Â Â  Thank you, Madam Commissioner and Vice-President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0475/2003) by Mr Paolo Costa on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing a transitional points system applicable to heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria for 2004 within the framework of a sustainable transport policy (PE-CONS 3689/2003 â C5-0562/2003 â 2001/0310(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Paolo Costa, has asked me to deputise for him because the agenda of the session has changed and he had to be in Italy.
The conciliation procedure for the Costa report on lorries in transit through Austria was extremely difficult and demoralising, if you like, for all of us who were involved, because this is an arrangement which concerns a specific Member State, namely Austria.
There were Members, Austrian members, who â quite understandably in my opinion â had every reason to have an acute awareness of the issues we were debating, because the Austrian people had, and continue to have, a particular awareness of this specific issue, which was why, moreover, the relevant protocol was drawn up when Austria acceded to the European Union in 1995.
However, these provisions have expired, which is why the European Parliament took the view even at first reading that 2006 should be the last year during which there should be specific arrangements for Austria, especially as there has been an improvement as regards environmental protection, which has also been recorded in the statistics given to us by the Commission.
As you know, there were differences of opinion between Parliament and the Council.
On the one hand, Parliament maintained that the measures granting Austria beneficial treatment should be limited solely to the Alpine area, while on the other hand the Council maintained that they should apply to the whole of Austria.
And then, as regards the lorries which should or should not pass through, Parliament again took the view that more lorries should pass through.
The views of the two institutions moved closer together during the conciliation procedure.
We accepted the Council's view that the special measures should apply to the whole of the Austrian state, while the Council moved closer to Parliament's view, meaning that some of the lorries which the Council proposed should not pass through or should pass through with quotas, will now pass through freely; this was the logic behind Parliament's proposals and it only concerns some, not all, of the lorries.
Finally, there was one issue, in that the number of lorries subject to quotas was limited, that is, how many eco-points should be available, and on this point Parliament, in a demonstration of solidarity with Austria and our honourable Austrian friends, called for the total number of eco-points to be limited by a considerable percentage.
Finally, this opinion on the part of Parliament was accepted by the Council and that is how we arrived at the result of the conciliation.
Our honourable Austrian friends voted against it because they considered the measures excessively strict for Austria, while there were other honourable Members, such as Mr Ferber from Bavaria, who considered that the result of the conciliation was excessively lenient for Austria and he therefore voted against it as well.
I have to say, both as a member of the conciliation committee and as representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that the result was balanced, the agreement which we reached was ultimately a good agreement and this is, if you like, also proven by the fact that the various directly interested parties voted against it, some because they considered the measures lenient and others because they considered them strict.
In all events, after such protracted and difficult negotiations, I cannot but recommend today to all the honourable Members, Mr President, that they vote in favour of the result which we achieved in the conciliation procedure, because these measures must apply until the cut-off date in 2006.
If, in the meantime, there is progress on the Eurovignette, the relevant agreement will also apply in the case of Austria.
Anyway, from 2006 onwards, the same will also apply to Austria as applies to the other European countries, the basic reason being that, according to the statistics at least, there has been an improvement in the environmental indicators, to which improvements in the lorry fleet have made a decisive contribution.
So there has been progress in the environmental performance of the lorries which pass through Austria.
Mr President, we the Group of the European People's Party will vote by a large majority in favour of the result of the conciliation procedure.
I am, of course, aware that some members are not happy.
To our honourable Austrian friends in particular, I want to say that we took very serious account of their comments and of the comments of the Austrian Government, which fought a very hard battle to support the Austrian positions.
However, we could go no further.
The same applies to the honourable Members from the other political groups.
We could not move any closer to the Austrian positions, because then we would have had problems with Members from other representations.
So we have a good result, as good as it could be and, for that reason, I think that it will be approved at the vote by a large majority of Members.
Let me point out to you, Mr Martin, that I am obliged by Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure to call you to order.
I will also point out to you that, should you repeat your actions and thus oblige me to do so again, a note will be made to that effect in the Minutes of the sitting.
If this warning is of no effect, then I will, with regret, have to order you from the Chamber, so I ask you to desist from your disorderly conduct.
Â Â  â Mr President, I did it because I was, until this morning, on the list of speakers, and was then âdeselectedâ by the parliamentary business manager of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, thus being deprived of the right to speak.
For the time that I would have spoken, I wanted to show, symbolically at any rate, what an independent in this House can stand for, even when someone from his own group prevents him from speaking.
I do, though, thank you for your understanding, Mr President.
Â Â  Mr Martin, that is of course a matter for your group alone, and has nothing to do with this House.
Where that is concerned, you will have to call your groupâs management to order.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Parliament and the Conciliation Committee for the work they have done on the proposed extension of the ecopoints system.
I would like in particular to thank Mr Imbeni and the rapporteur, Mr Costa, as well as the Council, for the efforts they have made over all this time in order to find a solution to the problem, holding discussions with the Council in order to reach an agreement.
I would like to say very clearly, so that there may be no doubt, that the Commission supports this compromise.
I know that the Austrian authorities and Members believe it to be insufficient, and I understand that there may be particular sensitivity, since it is true that we are talking about transit via Austria.
But I would like to say once again, ladies and gentlemen, that this compromise improves the conditions for traffic via Austria, for the simple reason that Protocol 9 of the Act of Accession of Austria to the European Union lays down, in Article 11(5), that, at the end of a series of extensions â all of which have been completed â the Community acquis in its entirety will be applicable.
The last of these extensions has already been adopted and expires on the 31st of this month.
Therefore, if this compromise is not approved, the principles of free movement would dictate that all the lorries which travel within the rest of the European Union would also be able to travel within Austria.
We are all aware of the special sensitivity of this issue and we have all made an effort to achieve it.
I would insist once again that I believe that the Austrian authorities, Members of Parliament, and also, very possibly, citizens â since this is an issue which the whole of Austria is very sensitive to â would have liked even greater protection, but I believe that by means of this transitional system we are managing to maintain, despite everything, a situation of privilege â let us make this very clear â for the sake of Austriaâs environmental protection.
Effectively, we are prohibiting the transit of the most polluting lorries through that country; lorries which, nevertheless, can travel â and are going to continue to travel â throughout the rest of the European Union.
In other words, we are diverting the most polluting lorries to other routes and only allowing the cleanest lorries to cross Austria.
I believe this is an example of European solidarity which, although it may seem to you insufficient, I would insist is a very important step, because we are continuing to maintain the system of points which, as well as removing the most polluting lorries, also restricts the traffic of lorries with an intermediate level of pollution, so that only the most modern and efficient lorries can travel freely through Austria.
I would therefore insist that all the most polluting and least efficient lorries will be travelling throughout the rest of the European Union.
It is crucial that Parliament votes for it today, since the current system expires on 31 December.
Nevertheless, operators will stop having ecopoints from 1 January 2004 and it is therefore necessary to adopt a decision with regard to the immediate application of the future provisional points system and allow the circulation of lorries in transit through Austria in a clear and decisive manner, with those limitations which, once again, I am pointing out.
I am well aware that this is not the solution; that the solution must be sought by means of the extremely urgent adoption of the Eurovignette system.
Today we have adopted the system of electronic road tolls, which comprises the technical elements which will facilitate the establishment of a Eurovignette system and, if we all manage to agree and show flexibility, we could adopt the Eurovignette over the next three or four months, with this same Parliament and this same Commission, during the Irish Presidency.
We in the Commission are going to make every necessary effort to achieve this objective, and I hope that Mr Cocilovo and this Parliament will continue working as it has done up till now in order to achieve it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I feel that what Mr Hatzidakis said, not least on behalf of the rapporteur, has clearly explained the technical content of this difficult conciliation and I feel that the Commissionerâs words, with which I agree, have clearly illustrated the political content of this extremely complex, extremely complicated decision, which it is difficult to describe in any other way.
Taking on board the difficulties â which we understand although we cannot justify the demands â of the Austrian people, we have decided to grant another privilegeÂ âÂ because that is what it is, as the Commissioner saidÂ âÂ and extend it to a particularly sensitive area such as the Alpine region and to the entire Austrian territoryÂ âÂ making it a twofold privilegeÂ âÂ and, rather than limiting it to 2004 and then maybe seeing what to do in 2005-2006, we have automatically extended it to 2006.
This is the subject of the agreement that we are now ready to support, fully aware that we are going beyond the call of duty.
We also believe, however, that, for the good and the preservation of the very sense of European Community, it is right that we make this sacrifice.
Any other objections would therefore be inappropriate.
Overall, a compromise has been achieved, which is excellent and the best compromise possible for it strikes a balance between the right to mobility and respect for the environment: it takes a gradual approach, it punishes what might be called the improper behaviour of those who fail to renew their HGV fleets while rewarding those who do behave properly, with due respect for the specific conditions and sensitivity of a region.
If anyone wants to pull out ofthis compromise, they are free to do so, but they would, without a doubt, be making a mistake: this is the best decision that could have been made and it must therefore be supported.
Â Â  Mr President, I feel that MrÂ Hatzidakisâ joke about the laborious nature of the task for all the Members of Parliament is the most concise, and also the best description of the work that has been carried out.
It was a difficult task in that we were working on a temporary basis with a Council that was often careless, heedless and given to putting off addressing or resolving issues until the last minute.
In conciliation, a balance was struck which made sense to all the institutions.
It is a balance between two requirements, which I would like to set out: on the one hand, the need to ensure the free movement of goods and compliance with Treaty, and, on the otherÂ âÂ something to which Parliament, just like Austria, attaches great importanceÂ âÂ the need to protect the environment and peopleâs health.
That means striving for sustainable development which, to address the problem earlier on in the process of pollution, must be achieved through intermodality, the development of rail tunnels and favouring rail transport over lorries.
In its wisdom, Parliament steered clear of simplistic solutions which certain elements with extreme views advocated in the debate: those defending carriers, on the one hand, and those defending the environment and health, on the other.
That is not the way things are as MrÂ Lisi said too.
The conciliation conclusions appear to highlight a number of points which give great consideration to the needs of Austria, first and foremost the fact that the last extension, which was set to end definitively at 31 December 2003, has been superseded by another extension which will take us up to the end of 2006.
The Commissioner pointed out that, while the most polluting lorries will continue to circulate throughout Europe, Austria will be preserved from a situation which other countries continue to suffer.
As Austria has requested, the application of this regulation and of the ecopoint system has been extended to the whole of the country of Austria, not just the Alpine passes; above all, the option of quotas, decided on at the proposal of the Commission, which has done an excellent job, is the option which comes closest to meeting Austriaâs demands.
The Commission is to be commended for its work and Parliament is to be commended for the balance it has displayed in performing this difficult task.
We are told that Austria wishes to stop benefiting from the exception made for it thus far.
We hope that this does not happen and that due consideration is given to the excellent quality of Parliamentâs work.
For these reasons, after two years of work, I can inform you that our group will vote for the conclusions reached in conciliation.
Â Â  â Mr President, it was not easy to reach agreement on the ecopoints.
I should like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Costa, for his efforts in this area and also his predecessor as Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Caveri, who has also worked hard on this.
Indeed, a great deal of energy went into striking a compromise and into changing the transitional system that was put in place upon Austriaâs accession, to a more general system.
No matter how much I appreciate Austriaâs specific problems and the way in which that country is trying to find an answer to them, I do believe that it is impossible for any one Member State to have a permanent derogation in this field.
It is clear, though, that there should be a balance between general environmental problems and the geographic situation in Austria on the one hand, and the free movement of goods, on the other.
I do not believe that the balance between those two elements is easy.
We could peddle very fine theories on this subject, but in practice, after all, tough decisions sometimes need to be taken.
I think it extremely important that we should also take a long-term view and try to draft a regulation for traffic across the Alps in general.
We should also examine this problem in the context of the Cocilovo report on the Eurovignette.
In any case, we regard the agreement that was reached in conciliation as an acceptable one.
My group will endorse it.
I am slightly worried, though, by the statements that the Austrian minister made following conciliation.
I think that statements of that kind are more likely to complicate matters than to contribute to a solution.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we now have a result from the Conciliation Committee concerning transit through Austria.
I am speaking on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
The group is opposed to this compromise because it would mean a general deterioration of the environment.
As I myself read the proposal, however, it is a useful compromise in which Parliament has had a very large proportion of its wishes met.
An acceptable balance has been found between consideration for the environment and respect for the free exchange of goods.
The proposal means that the ecopoint system can continue throughout 2004, with the option of extending it both in 2005 and 2006.
By that time, we shall hopefully at long last have achieved an overall system of road tolls for the whole of the EU.
Before we reach that point, however, there are still a number of problems of which both opponents and supporters of the compromise are required to take account with regard to Austria.
If we are finally to get to grips with the problem of pollution, we have to think along different, and new, lines.
We must move transported goods off the roads and onto the railways.
As matters appear right now, there is not much to indicate that there is sufficient will to increase capacity but, as with everything else in the world, you do not get something for nothing.
This means that the Austrians are obliged to concentrate upon railway capacity through Austria.
As I say, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is opposed to the proposal by the Conciliation Committee, but I personally shall vote in favour of it.
I should also like to say to the fellow MEP of mine who put on a demonstration in this House that I think it splendid that he has already begun his election campaign, but he would do better to conduct his demonstration at home in Austria instead of here in Parliament, in which case he and his vacuous demonstration would not, of course, be photographed, however.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Austria the Conciliation Committeeâs decision was received with anger and dismay by the government, Parliament, the entire population, by all parties and all the media.
There can be no talk of electioneering here.
I believe we could fill the empty chairs in this room thousands of times over today with people wanting to tell you of their anger and consternation.
It is the first time in the Unionâs legal history that the vital interests of a Member State have been treated in this way.
Many of you speak of forbearance â think about the word: Austria is treated with forbearance, privileges are granted, prerogatives are extended.
Many of you who speak in such terms seem to believe we built the Alps out of spite and we filled our countryside with the continentâs most sensitive plants so that we can stir up national hysteria.
What people in Austria feel is that there is a tremendous danger, and it does not involve only Austrian interests.
It is the danger that the right to the free movement of goods, with which we all agree, is becoming a religious right violating the human right to health and protection of the environment and that we are only taking accompanying measures but not guaranteeing people their basic right to health and environment.
I will not comment further on this never-ending story with its pitiful outcome.
But what you are doing today, Mr President, is raising a question of legal policy.
You are turning an environmental conflict, an ecological disaster, into a legal conflict that is unique in history.
Austria does not want that solution.
Nobody wants it.
Do you really want to force this regulation on us against this countryâs will, a regulation that is eyewash, camouflage, and which Austria will not enforce?
Is that really your intention?
Â Â  â Mr President, after that inspired effort by one of our Austrian MEPs, I should get back to earth, although I do understand the sentiments involved.
On 31 December next, the exceptional ecopoints agreement expires.
Much of our time this year has been taken up by the question of whether, and if so, how, this system should be followed up.
The report at first and second reading clearly addressed this issue.
Parliament wanted nothing but a transitional system from the current ecopoints system to a situation in which foreign lorries would also gain free transit through Austria.
This, however, did not appear to be what Austria had in mind.
The Council initially went along with this.
Now that we have reached the end of conciliation, it looks like the Council and Parliament are essentially in agreement after all.
The compromise embraces a regime in which the most polluting vehicles are barred and clean ones encouraged, while the available number of points are deducted annually.
This is a realistic balance in the light of the conflict between the need to protect the Alpine region â which is indeed vulnerable â and the principle of the free movement of goods â which is, after all, a reality in the European Union.
That is why we were bitterly disappointed when Austria announced its intention to abolish the ecopoints system as of 1 January 2004.
In this debate, I should like to make three appeals.
First of all, to Austria, that it may realise the long-standing mutual hostilities its attitude could possibly bring about.
Unnecessary internal irritation is far from constructive.
Secondly, I should like to urge the Commission to carefully monitor the admissibility of potential Austrian actions which may jeopardise the free movement of goods.
Thirdly, I should like to call on my fellow MEPs to review the Eurovignette directive without delay.
In its new form, it could provide an answer to the current gridlock.
I am pleased with the compromise that has been struck with the Council, and we therefore warmly support it.
Â Â  Mr President, tomorrow we shall be voting on a report that no longer deals with the original problem, namely the reduction of atmospheric pollutants by means of a qualitative and quantitative restriction on transit traffic through Austria.
The outcome of the Conciliation Committee is that far more ecopoints are available for vehicles remaining in the ecopoint system than are actually required.
The upshot is that this system in effect no longer sets any limits on transit traffic through Austria and is quite simply pointless.
Moreover, Austria is required to introduce an expensive counting system that is virtually unfeasible technically and brings only expense and no ecological benefits.
In view of this, the fact that the arrangement will apply for three years and not only for the Alpine passes but for the whole of Austria is completely irrelevant.
To agree to this arrangement would be sheer and utter nonsense and in the end will damage the standing of this House.
I therefore ask you to reject the report tomorrow.
It would land on the list of senseless decisions and that list is already long enough.
With every yes vote on this report we, the European Parliament, will be making ourselves a mockery six months before the elections.
Â Â  The discussion and resolution on the Costa report is a black day for one Member State, namely Austria.
Our country and its citizens are being ridden over roughshod in the most literal sense of the word, regardless.
But it is not a black day only for Austria; with this subject the European Parliament, too, is playing with its reputation and is gambling it away here as a representative of citizens and environmental interests, playing into the hands of the noise and exhaust lobby.
It was after all the European Parliament that amended the Commissionâs original legislative proposal by a large majority and pushed its position through.
The outcome of the conciliation procedure is that there are no more controls on transit traffic through Austria.
There are no more limits on the environmental damage and no more protection for the local people.
âRoad clear for free lorriesâ is the order of the day.
If, as some have said, that is a concession for Austria, I can only say: God save us from friends like that!
Under these circumstances, there is no question but that the Austrians will reject this proposed regulation.
We ask those of our fellow Members who are concerned for the European Parliamentâs reputation as an institution that is close to the citizens and friendly to the environment to support us in this.
However the vote goes, the problems will not be solved.
The Republic of Austria sees great difficulties in implementing what is to apply in future and the citizens will find the new rules hard to live with.
I can see one positive aspect to this whole development: next year we shall be debating the infrastructure charging directive here. It will apply for the whole of Austria.
It will no longer be about special favours for one country and its citizens.
Then we shall see how this Parliament and its Members will vote: as friends of the citizens and the environment or the way the noise and exhaust lobby wants.
Europeâs voters will express their gratitude on 13 June.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I stand here as an Austrian Member of Parliament, but above all as someone who has always stood up for the environment and as a Vienna city councillor with responsibility for transport who believed that economic and traffic growth should not come at the expense of the environment and health.
Perhaps we have sometimes presented the transit rules as an Austrian privilege or a special arrangement for Austria.
It was a special arrangement, but one with a particular pioneering function for Europe as a whole.
This transit rule has brought about a change in the heavy goods vehicle fleet in the whole of Europe.
It has been modernised, it has been made, if you like, more ecological, that is more friendly to the environment.
That is the very thing that is now being prematurely ended.
The rapporteur, who is unfortunately not present â it is interesting that this is the second time we have discussed the ecopoint system here without the rapporteur present; his predecessor was not present either; which shows how seriously it is sometimes taken â at least at one stage made a proposal that still gave an incentive to change.
But then it disappeared again.
The âtransitional systemâ we now have no longer contains any incentive to change over from more environmentally harmful to more environmentally friendly lorries.
And that is the greatest drawback, the biggest problem we in Austria have with this system.
Reference is always being made to the infrastructure charging directive. But I can already hear the arguments over that directive.
If we look at Mr Cocilovoâs proposal, it is clear that he does not even want what the Commission is proposing.
We are put off from one proposal to the next.
Rather than do that, we should make a general rule.
I am grateful for the rule, but I do not think it is sufficient.
But when this Parliament and certain groups and certain Members in particular cut it back even more and do not want even to accept the Commissionâs proposal for a minor diversion from road to rail, then in my opinion there is no longer much point to it.
That is my position.
To conclude, I am asking my fellow Members to reject it tomorrow because it is a sham.
I ask my fellow Members to really think again and to say No to a solution that is only pretending to be one.
Austria needs a real solution and that is not what we have here.
I hope we shall get more support over the infrastructure charging directive than we have had in this case.
Â Â  â Mr President, although progress has been made in the negotiations, I certainly do not think that it is enough.
We asked for protection for the entire Austrian region, and that has been accepted.
The amendment concerning the most polluting lorries â for environmentally-friendly lorries do not exist â has been adopted.
That is a .
Noise aspects have not been taken into consideration.
In short, we are left with a raft of problems.
I have pointed out before, right through this procedure â first reading, second reading, previous debates â that we are being faced with a problem of a democratic nature, a point also made by my neighbour.
It is for this reason that Austria regards the regulation as unacceptable.
Austria has consequently noted that, in the next couple of years, partly caused by the accession countries, transport through Austria could well double, if not quadruple.
Ultimately, it decided unilaterally to abolish the ecopoints system on 31 December.
As this confronts us with the question of what we will do next, I would ask the Commissioner how she sees things developing in the Council on 22 December.
After all, if Austria stands by its view, I do not know what we should do with this decision.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, points in life are generally good things, but these points are unfortunately incongruous.
Our esteemed fellow Member, MrÂ Swoboda, just said that Austria wants more.
All my sympathies are with the Austrians but, ladies and gentlemen, we are not in Vienna, in the Austrian parliament: we are in the European Parliament!
Can we ask ourselves the question as to whether Europe wants more?
Of course we can.
If I had been born in a valley in Austria the problem would look just like it does from your point of view.
But if we look at Europe as a whole, goods nevertheless travel between southern Europe and northern Europe.
If they do not go the direct route, and if they do not go the cheapest possible route, they find their own route going some other way.
Journeys become longer, there is more wear and tear to the roads, and there is more pollution.
We have to accept that within the EU we must adhere to common rules, although it might be trendy â and I fully understand this â to hide protectionism behind ecopoints, but we must see the wood and not just the trees.
We must see the bigger picture, as the saying goes, because if we transport goods in Europe the expensive way, so that pollution increases, who will pay?
It is always the end consumer that pays, that European earning just EUR 1 000 a month.
What should the solution be?
A switch to lorries that generate as little pollution as possible, and obviously, if possible, increased used of the railways.
We know in practice that they do not have sufficient capacity, but we shall do our best.
We should have tax concessions to switch to the most modern lorries, but it is not appropriate to go oneâs own way when we are building a common Europe.
We must see that the overall benefit is one the private European citizen can share.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, why was it so difficult to reach an agreement?
Because we were faced with the task of finding a solution for a country that has not itself played a constructive part in the process.
We have known what Austria does not want since the first reading here in the European Parliament on the Council decisions.
To this day I do not know what Austria does want. I only know that again they do not want the compromise.
So I ask for your understanding when I say that we have dealt with the matter quite seriously.
How can we find a continuation of the ecopoint system that does justice to Austriaâs legitimate interests if Austria does not take part in the decision-making process?
I can only say that I and my group agree with this compromise, even if the newspapers and the Parliamentâs Minutes and press releases said I voted against it â I only voted against the number of points because I thought 6.9 million was rather too low.
The Commission also had other calculations, but I was unable to get my way in the parliamentary delegation.
I am therefore naturally for the compromise that was reached.
When Mr Swoboda says we succeeded in introducing modern technology into Europe, he is right except for one country.
I would like to reiterate that here at this point: because of the ecopoint system the lorries on the roads in southern Germany and northern Italy are more modern than the ones the Republic of Austria itself has licensed in its own country because it does not use the ecopoint system.
Austria could have set a good example here with national rules.
The directive on the introduction of Euro 3 and Euro 4 made provision for this, for using tax incentives to encourage modernisation of the HGV fleet.
Then much of what has been said to us so emotionally today would have been easier to believe.
I hope that the compromise will be given a large majority here tomorrow.
Â Â  After eight years of heated debate, a solution to the ecopoints issue is, at last, on the horizon.
Indeed, the conciliation conclusions must be welcomed as restoring the balance in a situation whereby an instrument is being applied in Austria that holds back HGVs, which can travel freely everywhere else, including in the Alpine regions of France and Italy, without being subject to environmental tolls.
I repeat: including in the Alpine regions, and here, I am addressing the Austrian Member who talked as if the Alps were an exclusively Austrian concern.
Yet our problems are the same as those of which Austria complains and the environmental damage is the same.
We are all in favour of protecting our mountains and countries from an excessive amount of HGV traffic, but it is not by moving the cause of pollution elsewhere that the problem can be solved.
Nor is it any consolation that the environmental damage is paid for by extremely high tolls, the effect of which is to bring transport companies, especially the smallest and weakest, to their knees.
Indeed, the amount of damage does not change, irrespective of the tolls.
I agree with Mr Lisi: this solution is the best possible compromise and it ought to satisfy Austria too.
It may be, however, that Austria had become too used to the situation, or, perhaps, not used to it enough, depending on which way you look at it.
What, then, should we do at this juncture?
We need to start work resolutely on the trans-European networks, first and foremost the Brenner base tunnel and the high-speed four-track update of the Munich-Verona rail corridor, in order to provide a genuine rail alternative to road transport.
However, we need to make things very clear to the companies managing intermodality.
It is true that intermodality is currently being implemented in a fairly satisfactory way, but its prices, timetables and services need to be genuinely competitive and attractiveÂ âÂ or rather, convincingÂ âÂ so as to draw all the traffic from the roads onto the railways.
Â Â  â Mr President, whilst I naturally sympathise with the position of Austria and the Austrian MEPs, I consider the free movement of persons and goods one of the European Unionâs most important achievements.
Upon accepting membership, Austria obtained a derogation which was due to lapse on 31 December of this year.
By way of exception to the derogation, the Council and Parliament agreed in the conciliation meeting to extend the arrangement until the end of 2006.
Against the background of the principle of free movement, this is not a wise decision.
However, given the circumstances in Austria, I consider it to be an acceptable compromise between the principle of free movement and the protection of environmental interests.
Indeed, I support the idea that there should always be room for sustainable transport.
During the most recent conciliation meeting, Austriaâs Transport Minister dampened my delight at the agreement.
I consider refusing to carry out a freshly taken democratic decision to be wrong.
Meanwhile, judging from the press reports with regard to last weekendâs European Council, this emotional statement appears to have become the Austrian Governmentâs position.
Although I urge acceptance of the compromise that has been reached, I wonder what will be the implications of this decision, which is to be taken democratically.
I should like to hear from the Commission in what way free transit through Austria can be guaranteed within the provisions of the agreement reached in the compromise on environmental pollution, if the Austrian Government chooses to ignore this agreement and assumes it can regulate the issue as it sees fit.
Does the Commission see any scope for convincing the Austrian Government at this stage of the benefit of the agreement reached, one that, in any event, encourages the use of cleaner vehicles for transit?
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would again like to straighten out something that has been said here.
When I look at the Austrian Member who spoke of a basic right to health that we are all trampling under foot, yes, ladies and gentlemen, then I would like to call for an immediate stop to night journeys by freight trains, because peopleâs health is affected when railway trains travel through cities and villages at night making a tremendous amount of noise.
Or I would call on the Austrians to close all their skiing areas, because I can assure you I can find enough experts to show you that what you are doing in tourism in skiing areas is bad for human health and the environment.
You must be careful not to exaggerate with what you say.
We are always looking at balanced legal situations where there is one legal asset and another legal asset and we have to find a balance between them.
I believe that this compromise, which we have reached after long discussions, is a balanced solution.
Because the compromise bans the transit of the dirtiest lorries; if the compromise is not adopted, then not only Greek lorries, which funnily enough you want to allow and which are the dirtiest on the road, but all dirty lorries will be able to drive through Austria.
That is just an example to say, firstly, that your own position is not as glorious as it seems and, secondly, that this compromise does have advantages.
My final comment is that one must always be careful what high horse one gets up on.
Remember that in 1994 the Heads of State or Government called for the construction of the Brenner base tunnel as one of the 14 priority projects.
Up until a year ago, your own Austrian planning envisaged that the Brenner base tunnel should be completed in 2021.
And in response to pressure from this Parliament and others, Austria has now decided to bring forward the construction of the Brenner base tunnel to 2012.
People who claim justice is on their side should be careful and consider whether they are really the saints they think they are.
Â Â  . â Mr President, firstly, Mr Swoboda is correct to say that the system of ecopoints will benefit everybody, since it will speed up the modernisation of the lorry fleet; secondly, it is being maintained, although not in the way the honourable Member would like.
Therefore, because a system of ecopoints is being maintained, which means special protection for the whole of Austrian territory â which is very significant â I would ask the honourable Members to support this proposal, and remind them that in the codecision procedure it is not the Commission which negotiates or acts, but this Parliament and the Council.
The Commission's only capacity is to try to facilitate an agreement.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 am.
Â Â  The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0464/2003) by Mr Lisi on behalf of the Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91 (PE-CONS 3676/2003 â C5-0518/2003 â 2001/0305(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, this Commission proposal on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights has, at lastÂ âÂ it is to be hopedÂ âÂ come to the end of its journey.
Before going any further, I have to say that I believe conciliation has yielded the best possible outcome, given the fact that the process has been just as difficult and complex as that we have just been discussing.
I will now summarise the key points of this conciliation, which focused on what had not been resolved at first and second readings, but I would also like to stress the essential and fairly simple concept underpinning this compromise: in other words, we have to consider the rights of air transport passengers as part of a more general context, as part of the whole system of air transport.
A system in which all the players on the field, including control authorities, management authorities, airlines and the passengers themselves, are interdependent.
Thus, the best way of guaranteeing effective passenger rights is to ensure the smooth running of this system: to make sure that none of the rules we want to introduce hampers this extremely sensitive, large-scale mechanism.
As the Members will remember, the Commissionâs initial proposal gave rise to huge numbers of concerns.
Parliament attempted to address them by adopting 40 amendments.
Then came a Council common position, which we immediately realised had improved the text, in particular as regards the then thorny issue of the amount of compensation, although other points which Parliament had raised had not been followed up.
What were the most important of these points?
They were those which concerned procedures for implementing the various levels of assistance to passengers in the event of cancellation or long delay of flights. Now, as regards these two points, long delay and cancellation of flights, I believe that the result we have achieved reflects to a great extent what the best airlines already offer to passengers voluntarily and only introduces one new element, namely the certainty of these rights for passengers, certainty which is not limited, even though extraordinary circumstances are not excluded.
Indeed, we convinced the Council, and Parliament is pleased to have achieved this, that there is just one message we have to send out: âDear passenger, we cannot guarantee you many rights, we can only guarantee you a few, but those which we guarantee are certain, they are not subject to conditionsâ.
It would, indeed, be a mistake and counterproductive to raise expectations and then see these rights denied and these expectations crushed by the behaviour of airlines.
I am talking about even the most basic rights such as, for example, the right to be able to have a drink, to be able to make a telephone call, to be able to contact friends or relatives.
We have therefore produced a mechanism which introduces a tier-system for services which have to be provided to passengers, and, most importantly, a full range: from minimum serviceÂ âÂ on-the-spot assistance in airports in the event of cancellation of flights or excessive delays of over five hoursÂ âÂ to some sort of compensation for damages, specifically financial compensation, which is the highest level of protection we have provided.
I feel it is important to mention the agreement on mutual right of redress: this was an important point of the conciliation text because it allows, for instance, tour operators who have to comply with these regulations to claim from the air carrier operating the service where the air carrier is responsible for the provision of bad service.
As you know, the other points are of minor importance, such as, for example, coherence with everything we had introduced at first reading.
I will end, Mr President, by thanking all those who have helped to achieve this result, which I feel is to be supported, despite the pressure in recent hours from a number of lobbies who are doing everything they can to stop the text being adopted.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Parliamentâs delegation in the Conciliation Committee and in particular it chairperson, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, and the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, on the wonderful work they have done on such a complicated issue.
This Regulation is intended to reduce the frequency with which two entirely unacceptable practices take place in the field of transport, which seriously prejudice passengers, who sometimes feel â we feel â as if we are treated as luggage, rather than people, or citizens, or consumers with rights.
One of these practices consists of passengers with perfectly valid tickets, who fulfil all their conditions, not being allowed to fly when the time comes to use it.
The other practice consists of a flight being suspended by an air company, despite the passenger holding a perfectly valid ticket, in other words a contract with that company, not for external or extraordinary reasons preventing the flight â such as fog, for example â but for commercial reasons such as, for example â and I imagine that this has not just happened to me and that some of the honourable Members will have been in the same situation â there being few passengers for that flight.
The provisions being proposed here are intended to establish compensation which will mean that air companies do not have incentives and are dissuaded from carrying out these practices and furthermore to restrict as far as possible the inconveniences and problems caused for passengers and citizens who find themselves in these situations.
I am not going to go into details, because the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, has explained them very well.
I hope that, with the entry into force of the Regulation, there will be a drastic reduction in the number of passengers prevented from flying and that, if this happens, that thanks to the use of the auction system or volunteer system â which is implemented with this system â there will be few difficulties and problems for citizens.
I know that some of the honourable Members are concerned, and also that representatives of certain airlines have talked at length with some of you, in defence of their legitimate interests.
I understand this concern, but I would like to say to you that companies are now clearly getting through the rough patch they have suffered over recent years.
Nobody has greater responsibility and greater concern for the economic success of our air companies than the Commission.
In this regard, we have implemented over all these years a series of measures aimed at supporting, sustaining and defending our air companies within Europe and outside of it.
I would remind you of one of these measures: the âSingle Skyâ initiative, which is going to mean a reduction in costs and better rotation of the fleet, the authorisation of alliances, the combating of distortions in competition conditions â specifically, the issue of support for our air companies in the face of anti-competitive or predatory practices on the part of third countries â and the support we have given them in relation to issues such as insurance when there have been difficulties in the past.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we are dealing with European air companies and defending their interests, which is what we must do: now we are specifically negotiating agreements with the United States, so that we may have a United States-European Union common transatlantic aviation zone.
That is not all, however, because we must also defend the rights of passengers, of citizens.
And that is what we are going to support and strengthen through these measures.
I would also like to say that serious and responsible companies are already applying the majority of these measures on a voluntary basis.
Mr President, I hope that tomorrow this Parliament will support the result of this conciliation, and I would like once again to thank the chairperson, Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, and the rapporteur, Mr Lisi.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think that we all agree that the passenger, by which I mean the person who has planned to travel by aeroplane and who goes to the airport, only to be told that he cannot fly or that his flight is severely delayed, so that his trip makes no sense, should have some basic protection.
That is why all of us, from the beginning, focussing on the consumer's interests, said that this view should be supported.
On the other hand, we also looked at the interests of the airlines, especially in this critical period which we are going through in the air transport sector and, for this reason, the European Parliament was in favour, from the outset, of balanced measures which, on the one hand, would serve the consumer without, on the other hand, damaging the airlines and their competitiveness.
Our rapporteur, Mr Giorgio Lisi, who has done an excellent job, which was ultimately crowned with success during the conciliation procedure, also personally took this line.
I personally was in favour, including during the conciliation procedure, and I shall also vote in favour of the result of the agreement with the Council tomorrow, because I think that, without damaging the airlines, it provides a good framework within which to protect the consumer, the passenger.
I know that certain airlines continue to have some objections.
I have taken them into account, but I do not agree with them.
I think they are exaggerating, I think that the agreement we have is a good agreement and that we should accept it as it stands.
Â Â  One thousand and fifty passengers are denied boarding in Europe every year despite having a valid ticket in their pockets.
Flight cancellations and delays are also increasing, especially in the tourist season.
That is not in the consumerâs interests.
My group therefore welcomes the regulation.
It will give us a uniform European legal framework, probably from 2005.
I am sure we have succeeded in achieving a fair balance between the interests of consumers and carriers.
The excessive level of compensation sought by the Commission has been cut back to a realistic amount.
The reference to extraordinary circumstances reduces carriersâ responsibility to a reasonable level.
I therefore anticipate that the Council will follow Parliament in agreeing to the outcome of conciliation.
This represents an advance over the existing arrangements because we now have a list of benefits to which passengers are legally entitled, not just in cases of overbooking as before, but also when flights are cancelled or delayed. At the heart of the improvement are the compensation payments, which are twice as high as was hitherto the norm in Europe under the voluntary arrangements.
For example, if I get to Tegel before finding out that my flight from Berlin to Mallorca has been cancelled, I not only get my ticket replaced, but I also get EUR 400 compensation.
I get the same amount if I am left behind because of overbooking.
This also places a measure of pressure on airlines to be more sensitive in their use of the overbooking system, necessary as it is.
Of course, we also hope that greater efforts will be made to reduce delays and the occasional abusive cancellation of flights when they are not quite full.
One side effect of the regulation will be to reduce the gap in the terms of competition between budget and traditional airlines.
We are now setting standards for passenger rights in aviation which sooner or later ought to apply for other modes of transport as well.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have, then, finally obtained a compromise proposal concerning compensation for air passengers, and we in the European Parliament, in particular, should be pleased about this proposal.
Of Europeâs assemblies, ours is probably the one whose Members travel most as part of our daily work.
We are therefore only too well aware of overbooked, delayed flights and poor service, as well as the resultant frustration.
I therefore believe that the proposal, involving limits upon delays and compensation in the event of cancellations, would put pressure upon the airlines, which would thus be given a clear incentive to tighten up on departures and get their planes away on time, to the benefit of passengers.
It would also hopefully lead to more sensible departure times and clear compensation for passengers whenever they do not leave on time.
Details of the compensation payable by the airlines must, however, be publicly available so that people can see clearly what it amounts to.
There is, however, a problem I fear may arise.
In connection with the legislation, the principle, which is also to apply to package trips, has been introduced of refunding air tickets.
That is something I can, of course, only welcome since it places European consumers in a better position.
The problem is just that it can often be difficult to discover the correct price of an airline ticket that is part of a package trip.
I am certain, however, that this is something that can easily be solved in practice, as and when the problem arises.
In general, I am, as I say, well satisfied with the proposal by the Conciliation Committee and hope and expect it to be adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, my Group very much welcomes this report.
The proposal is important because improving the conditions and criteria under which passengers should be reimbursed and assisted in the event of being denied boarding, cancellation or long delays is something that must be welcomed.
We must also take account of cases of cancellation or long delays due to valid technical reasons for safety.
We do not want to create a situation where airlines will decide to fly regardless of what the outcome will be.
Nevertheless there have been many cases where passengers have been denied boarding because of overbooking â something which many in this Parliament will have experienced regarding some airlines in Europe â and people have been left high and dry, whether it be in Brussels or somewhere else.
A constituent of mine bought a flight online with the notorious Ryanair but when they went to collect the ticket they were denied access because they had an international student ID card and were refused boarding on the grounds that it was out of date.
So they used a national student ID card which was valid but this was refused.
So there is a major problem of what actually constitutes acceptable ID.
This person paid quite a lot of money for the ticket; it was not one of those tickets costing a couple of euro, it was quite expensive.
So how much are airlines making on this?
Another constituent got as far as London where he was then refused boarding on a continuing flight out of London to Europe.
Airlines need to take responsibility for their passengers.
They cannot be allowed to get away with treating passengers like this any longer.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Conciliation Committee and Mr Lisi for the agreement that we reached.
This regulation will, I hope, encourage airlines and travel companies to curtail their normal practices.
I also welcome the reference that the regulation makes to sanctions, which have to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
In this respect, air passengers should receive compensation, an alternative flight, and assistance appropriate to the inconvenience suffered, and they should be offered these things as quickly as possible, which is not always the case at present.
The extension of air passengersâ rights to include all types of flight is a welcome innovation. Thus passengers on scheduled flights, which represent only half of the market, and those on non-scheduled flights, particularly on package tours, will be able to assert their rights in the same way.
As the Commission Stated in its White Paper, âEuropean transport policy for 2010: time to decideâ, its objective is to refocus that policy on the basis of citizensâ demands and needs. We are counting on that.
The inconvenience resulting from denied boarding, namely stress, fatigue and humiliation, can have serious consequences for the people affected.
They may lose business, be prevented from attending funerals and so on. Members of this Parliament who frequently have to use air transport in order to travel between Brussels, Strasbourg and their own regions are particularly aware of such inconvenience and of the resulting loss of time.
Furthermore, as Vice-Chairman of the âHandicapâ Intergroup, I am glad that Article 11 refers to giving priority treatment to persons with reduced mobility.
However, the list could have been extended to cover people travelling with young children.
As for the exemptions in the case of strikes, the required periods of notice should make it possible for airlines to react in good time and to remain subject to the constraints of this regulation.
I also welcome the provision concerning the obligation to inform passengers concerning their rights, by means of a notice in easily legible characters displayed in the check-in area, giving special attention â more explicit than that laid down in the regulation â to providing information, by appropriate means, for blind or partially sighted persons.
Such passenger-protection schemes should be extended to cover other modes of transport.
Finally, it would appear fundamentally necessary for airlines to seek to ensure, in advance, that they offer a high-quality service to their passengers, so that the latter no longer have to suffer any inconvenience.
I hope that the Members of this House will support this agreement, which seeks to respect the rights of passengers so that the practices in question occur as rarely as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, since rapporteur Lisi has already given us an excellent explanation of the compromise, I would simply like to deal in my address with a few rumours or arguments.
Some Member States have recently been having doubts about the compromise, thinking it places too heavy a burden on the airlines.
But that cannot be the case at all.
The European Parliament has clearly reduced the rates of compensation in the airlinesâ favour.
The European Parliament has introduced clear rules for cases of so that airlines do not have to act if they are not responsible for the circumstances leading to a cancellation or overbooking.
The Parliament has even put back the entry into force for 12 months because we take the airlinesâ particular and difficult economic situation seriously.
So these entire arrangements will not come into force until 2005.
If the transport industry, be it the tourism sector or some other one, is now voicing doubts about this compromise, then I have to say that it is more than unfair and not at all acceptable.
Many governments need to think whether they want to risk being shown by us as a Parliament to be clearly hostile to the consumer if they take this line in the Council.
European elections are looming, should the Council wish to take this subject up.
May I make one further remark in conclusion?
The budget airlines, who did not take any of this at all seriously at first, are now coming and saying that these levels of compensation are far too high.
If a budget airline offers a flight for EUR 50, then it is still obliged to make the flight, despite the low price.
Because the rights of the citizen who wants to go somewhere at a particular time, be it for business or tourism, have been violated and he must be compensated if he is left standing or can only fly a day later.
Even budget airlines must compensate their passengers.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the Commissioner for bringing forward this proposal and our rapporteur, Mr Liese, for bringing forward this report.
I could also thank Mr Jarzembowski for saying many of the things I was going to say, which is a rare thing indeed.
I agree with him completely, for example, that it is a nonsense to say that the airlines will not cope.
Let us be honest: air travel will double in Europe in the next 30 years, so it is not as if the airlines cannot afford to provide a glass of water and a biscuit if there is a delay.
That is the sort of basic standard we should expect in the future, if this goes through.
I welcome many of the features.
For example, for too long passengers have suffered when airlines have cancelled or delayed flights for purely commercial reasons.
I hope that will end.
At last airlines will be forced to provide passengers with the food and refreshments they deserve, with the dignity and respect they deserve.
I hope that all this will mean that the days of commercial cancellations and lengthy delays will be over.
This is a great breakthrough for all airline passengers and also for the airlines, because it will not affect good airlines which look after their passengers.
In conclusion, this deal could have been even better had colleagues on that side of the House stood firmer in conciliation.
That was not to be.
To misquote Neil Armstrong: it may not be a giant leap for mankind, but it is an important first step.
Finally, I want to remind the Commissioner that we look forward to receiving similar rules for international rail, ferry and coach journeys soon.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I totally agree with MrÂ Watts: we deserve more than a biscuit and a glass of water.
In the last 30 years I have been flying round the world an average of twice a week, which is perhaps more than many others here in this House.
I cannot in general agree with the statement made by many of my fellow Members that air passengers are being treated badly.
We deserve rights but should we cram as many Christmas presents as possible into this package?
Because, ladies and gentlemen, what do the airlines do for money?
They operate using the money they receive from us, the passengers.
Would it not be better to solve these problem situations through greater competition, broken monopolies and reduced regulation?
We cannot provide passengers with better service by increasing legislation and putting a strain on the airlines, because even todayâs system works excellently in the countries which apply it.
We live in a world of open competition and this will only mean that third countries will have the competitive edge.
The European consumer deserves as many options as possible and the cheapest tickets possible.
More red tape of this sort will not help the situation.
With regard to interlining, I would say that if a British Airways flight from Tokyo arrives at Helsinki and Finnair goes on from there to Oulu and this onward flight is cancelled due to bad weather, it is unfair if Finnair has to pay the whole cost of the ticket.
I truly believe that an air passengerâs rights must be protected, but air passengers and airlines go hand in hand and, at the end of the day, their interests cannot be separated.
Increased fares may easily be awaiting us at the end of the runway.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on this initiative and acknowledge the excellent work Mr Lisi has done by means of the different parliamentary process we have seen.
I do not believe that anybody disputes the importance of the air sector, but I am from a country for which the air sector is of great strategic importance.
I believe that those countries with a high level of tourism have a greater interest than anybody in the air sector being more solvent and having greater capacity, since vital elements of development depend on it in numerous European countries.
But it is true that this is perfectly compatible with passengers being compensated for the harm done to them.
What is the harm done to a passenger when they are delayed?
Is it simply that they are made to wait two, three or four hours in the departure hall?
When there is an overbooking, what harm is done to the passenger?
It would be very difficult to evaluate that harm, but I am absolutely certain that it is a harm which goes much further than the compensation which we are establishing here, at times without any possible comparison.
We must therefore deal with it.
I believe that this Parliament has carried out a very important and interesting exercise with this report.
I would therefore like to thank Mr Lisi for the care he has taken.
Parliament has moderated â and even reduced, in some cases â the proposals presented to us by the Commission and the Council.
We have taken account of the objective interests and the survival of companies, which does credit to this Parliament and, naturally, it seems to me absolutely essential that we stop classifying many of the specious arguments that companies frequently give passengers as âextraordinary circumstancesâ.
I believe we have begun an interesting process.
Let us hope that it is extended to other forms of transport and that we go further in this direction.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Lisi.
It goes without saying that I, along with my colleagues, expect passengers travelling on European airlines to be treated in a fair and respectful manner.
I also firmly believe that if their travel plans are disrupted and it is the fault of the airline, then that airline should take full responsibility.
Sadly this regulation, in its present state, will badly damage our airline industry and, in particular, our regional and low-cost carriers, thereby threatening jobs and reducing the opportunities the consumer has come to expect in terms of choice and a competitive level of airfares.
It is therefore with regret that I will be unable to support this regulation, for the following reasons.
First, in the final draft of Article 6, referring to delays, the regulation is seriously flawed.
The exclusion of extraordinary circumstances places an unacceptable financial burden on the carrier.
Situations such as industrial disputes, air traffic delays, adverse weather conditions and possible terrorist threats cannot be foreseen by any airline.
Therefore to include full reimbursement, as well as a return flight to the first point of departure, is wholly unacceptable.
To suggest that the airlines will be able to obtain compensation from third party providers is a myth.
Maybe they will apply to heaven if it is a weather problem.
Secondly, referring to Article 5 on cancellations, I echo my previous points.
The impact of this regulation has taken no account of Parliament's support in strengthening our regional airports.
Nor has the Commission thought through the impact on charter carriers, which often have only one or two flights a week to particular destinations.
In conclusion, at the beginning of this process I criticised the Commission on its ill-timed, badly drafted proposal.
It ignored the new voluntary commitment and failed to provide a financial impact assessment.
An extra GBP 1 billion of costs for the airlines will not benefit passengers but will penalise them by increasing the price of tickets and reducing choice.
The irony is that none of these rules would apply to third country airlines flying into the EU.
If the Commission wanted to give our business away to the rest of the world, then it has done a jolly good job.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we shall of course be voting in favour of this regulation.
We believe that we have come up with a more or less balanced text, compared with an initial proposal which seemed to us to contain a certain number of risks.
It is clear that passengersâ rights are sacred.
All too often the airlines treat them very lightly, whether it is a matter of looking after their passengers or of providing them with information.
It is also clear that the practice of overbooking has in many cases revealed its limitations and proved that it is used as a commercial tool.
We have even seen cases where planes did not take off because they were not full, which is absolutely inadmissible for someone who has signed a sale or purchase contract as part of the process of obtaining a ticket.
I believe that the text we have come up with is balanced overall.
On the one hand, it tries to ensure that the practice of overbooking does not constitute a purely commercial practice but is restricted to a flexibility practice.
We are aware that overbooking will never be reduced to zero by the airlines, because that is how they manage imponderables.
There are some of us here in this House who often travel by air, and many of us benefit from overbooking practices when we arrive late or when things do not go according to plan and we have trouble getting to the airport.
I do not think, therefore, that we ought to make a big issue of it.
Moreover, the compensation scheme must be fair and equitable, and it must not be too complicated if we are to avoid endless disputes, and above all it should not be an incentive to airlines to take risks with safety.
We must not go too far: we must not end up with a situation in which airlines are determined to take off at any price, even if there is a technical incident, because it would otherwise cost them too much to provide compensation for passengers.
I hope that we have achieved this sort of balance in this report.
I hope so but I am not altogether sure.
Nevertheless, we shall be giving it our support.
Â Â  Mr President, it may be worthwhile just to reflect for one moment on why it was thought necessary to introduce legislation to make compensation a legal right for those air passengers who face cancellation and delay through no fault of their own.
It was thought necessary because some airlines had got into a very bad habit of cancelling flights at the last minute, overbooking flights, inflicting delay because of inefficient operational practices and then, to add insult to injury, they treated their victims â their passengers â with total disdain and little or no sympathy.
Members may wish to dwell on the fact that a voluntary code of practice did exist with the more reliable airlines.
However, the refusal of the so-called low-cost carriers to sign up to this voluntary agreement and the low levels of compensation given to the victims meant action on a more formal basis was required.
The pendulum had to swing back in favour of the consumer to a more reasonable, balanced position.
The proposal before us is a first step in ensuring that the travelling public are protected when transport operators fail to live up to their promises and obligations.
I look forward to similar schemes being introduced with other modes, particularly ferries and so-called high-speed ships.
What we have before us today is not perfect.
I regret that the Council of Ministers insisted on charter flights being included.
I also regret the removal of extraordinary circumstances in the delay section, but welcome the exemption of rotor operators, the levels of compensation agreed and the inclusion of the low-cost carriers.
This proposal is not perfect: it poses many questions in regard to existing legislation and highlights areas where existing legislation is inadequate.
I cite the package travel directive as one example.
But we must recognise that at last consumers and the travelling public are being given rights that they deserve, backed up with compensation when airlines fail in their promises.
Over recent months I have been subjected to every kind of doom-and-gloom scenario from some airlines and even certain Members of Parliament.
But remember this: if the airlines do not cancel or overbook, if they run the services they advertise on time and stick to their contract with the travelling public, then this proposal will not cost them one euro.
It becomes expensive to airlines when they fail to deliver â and what is wrong with that?
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this regulation.
As others have already mentioned, it is not a perfect solution, but it is necessary at this time.
We would not need a regulation of this kind if it were not for the fact that every year in Europe over 500 000 passengers are affected by cancellations and the denial of boarding.
It is important that the European Parliament and the Commission are seen to be serving the public of Europe.
This regulation demonstrates the added value that the European Union can provide in terms of rights for European citizens.
It is probably true to say that every single Member of this House has had some experience of the kinds of problems faced by ordinary passengers and it is good that we are now dealing with this issue.
Â Â  . â Mr President, it is not realistic to expect perfection, but I believe that this is a step forward in terms of the protection of passengersâ rights and I hope that Parliament can support this initiative tomorrow.
I would like to thank all the Members who have worked on it, in particular the rapporteur, Mr Lisi, and Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mrs de Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B5-0416/2003).
The following questions are addressed to the Commission
Â Â  . â Mr President, honourable Member, the European Commission shares your concern about drugs passing through Turkey.
The Association Agreement with Turkey provides for institutions allowing the Commission to monitor very closely whether Turkey is adopting and implementing Community measures on organised crime and drugs and how it is doing so.
Negotiations are also currently taking place for observer status for Turkey in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
I think Turkey will be given that observer status next year.
Work will begin on 1 January 2004 under a partnership arrangement to set up a national contact point for the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction and to encourage the development and implementation of a national strategy on drugs.
The Commission also believes that a small Dublin Group should be set up in Ankara as quickly as possible.
I am pleased to be able to tell you that Turkey has made and is making great efforts to prevent drug trafficking.
Turkey is actively involved in international measures to prevent the channelling of heroin from Afghanistan into the European Union.
By the very nature of things, honourable Member, I cannot tell you anything about the nature of those measures here, because some of them involve operations by the secret services.
I can only say that the information available to the Commission shows that Turkey is cooperating fully and that the undertone in your question is unjustified.
In 2002, the Turkish authorities seized 2Â 124 kg of heroin.
That was less than in previous years.
The reason for this is that the international drug traffickers have changed their routes as a result of the strict controls in Turkey.
In 2003, the Turkish customs introduced the latest systems at three border crossings, allowing vehicles passing through those crossings to be checked by scanners. This has resulted in the discovery of large quantities of smuggled drugs.
When it comes to international cooperation, the Turkish customs authorities hold monthly meetings with drugs liaison officers who are sent to Turkey.
It goes without saying that in its cooperation with Turkey the Commission presses for full compliance with all agreements and provisions relating to the fight against drugs.
Â Â  That was a very full and helpful reply, Commissioner.
In relation to your comment that you could not necessarily infer the issues in my question, I should like to point out that I was directly quoting the head of a police intelligence service in London, who was commenting on the effects of Turkish heroin in the UK.
As a supplementary, I should like to ask you about the 'small Dublin group' to be set up in Ankara.
In your own words, could you define that term for me?
Â Â  . â Honourable Member, I asked this very same question when I came to deal with your question.
I am therefore in the happy position of being able to give you a very precise answer.
First, you need to know what a Dublin Group is.
The Dublin Group is the grouping of industrialised nations, that is all the EU Member States, the USA, Canada and Australia, which coordinates initiatives to combat drugs and drug trafficking.
In cooperation with third countries who do not belong to this Dublin Group, this group deploys âmini Dublin Groupsâ with a regional coverage, so a mini Dublin Group in Ankara would mean that the members of the Dublin Group and Turkey cooperate in these matters in Turkey itself.
Â Â  . â Honourable Member, the Commission is not at present planning a communication on the application of the competition rules in sport.
The Commission believes that the established practice of action on a case by case basis, which now goes back several years, provides sound guidance as to when and to what extent the competition rules apply.
The international sporting bodies that are primarily responsible for regulating sport are generally aware of these rules in any case.
The competition rules of the EC Treaty apply only for economic activities in connection with sport; they do not of course apply for genuine sporting activities.
There are borderline cases and there may also be borderline cases where it is hard to make the distinction between economic and non-economic activities.
But those problems are best dealt with on a case by case basis because account can then be taken of the particular nature of the sport in question.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for your reply.
I would like to ask you whether you believe that the fact that the Commission has over recent years had to adopt this series of decisions relating to sport in the field of policy and competition highlights even more clearly â if that is possible â the need to include an article on sport in the future European Union Treaty.
Â Â  . â That, honourable Member, is an interesting reference to the current debate about the constitution.
The Commission can in fact well imagine special attention being paid to sport in the proposed constitution.
However, if I rightly understand the discussion that has taken place about it in the Convention and in public, the issue is not so much the question of the application of competition rules but rather whether the European institutions can also be given a âsoftâ competence in the realm of sport.
Coming back to the issue of competition policy, the Commission does not for the future rule out a definition that would then be embodied in a communication.
But for the present I can only repeat our position that we believe it is better for all concerned that doubtful cases should be decided as they arise in the light of decisions already taken.
Â Â  As the author is not present, Question No 27 lapses.
Â Â  â Honourable Member, I am very grateful to you for this question because it in fact touches on a very, very important aspect of the whole accession process.
And I can inform you that the question of human rights and thus of respect for and protection of minorities have been key elements for the opening of accession negotiations since the introduction of the accession process by the Copenhagen European Council over 10 years ago.
I would like to say again expressly here that fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria is a prerequisite for the commencement and conclusion of negotiations with applicant countries, and we define this as meaning that applicants must be fully developed democracies, that the rule of law must be fully developed, that human rights must be fully respected and minorities must be protected in accordance with the European standard for minorities.
The Commission has always followed developments affecting minorities in all applicant countries closely for the pre-accession strategies and the Europe agreements.
The regular reports on progress in the applicant countries have dealt with this question in detail every year, and they have not only reported on improvements and advances, but have also, as you know, always been very clear about shortcomings.
All this has been possible because we have been and are in permanent contact with the parties involved in the process, including the representatives of ethnic groups and minorities.
Apart from the Commission servicesâ regular contacts through EU delegations visiting a country or administrative centre, the Commission has sponsored or taken part in many committees and seminars on various questions affecting minorities.
These contacts will continue to be cultivated in the months ahead even after accession.
I would like to assure you that the Commission has always cultivated close contacts with minorities and their representatives or the relevant non-governmental organisations in Europe and will naturally continue to do so.
Â Â  I have just one question concerning the group of countries that will now be acceding on 1 May.
Will you until 1 May still be the point of contact for any minority representatives in those accession countries who still wish to raise a concern before then?
Is that still within your field of competence?
That is one question, and the second question is, who will be the point of contact in the Commission following accession?
Â Â  . â This question gives me an opportunity to make that clear because it is obvious that not everyone has understood it yet.
My competence for relations with the accession countries is complete and undivided up until 1 May 2004.
That therefore means that anything that still has to be discussed with those countries passes through me and if minority representatives want talks or if something still needs to be raised with the governments in this area I am naturally willing to do so.
Quite by chance, I met with the representatives of the German minority in Poland in Wroclaw only a few days ago.
So if there should be any concerns I am ready to do so.
After 1 May â after accession â the commissioners will be responsible for the areas of falling within their portfolios.
So in the matter of the protection of minorities I think my colleague Mr Vittorino will be taking over after 1 May 2004 and if I know him he will certainly be very committed to seeing that the rights of minorities are safeguarded everywhere.
Â Â  â Commissioner, you know that our party, the Communist Party of Greece, has raised the problem of the rights of the Russian-speaking minority in the Baltic States on numerous occasions.
The situation is unacceptable.
One third of the population in two of these three states does not have the right to be a citizen or, of course, to take part in the referendum on the accession of these countries to the European Union, and has no opportunity to study at university in their language and a series of other things.
We have had no satisfactory answer from you or from the European Union in general and I really cannot understand how it is that you can show such sensitivity, for example, to the rights of Albanian speakers in Kosovo and can bomb Kosovo and bomb Serbia; how you can talk about the rights of a few opponents of the establishment in Cuba and have not the slightest interest in the policies, which I have no hesitation in calling dreamed-up neo-fascist policies, of the governments of the Baltic states.
It is, in my opinion, an example of gross hypocrisy.
Â Â  â The Commission does not agree with you, honourable Member.
Like the Council of Europe and the OSCE, the Commission is of the opinion that the Baltic states meet the human rights standards completely and that the treatment of minorities in those countries is also fully in line with European standards.
Â Â  . â Honourable Member, this is a particularly serious and painful topic and, as you know, the Commission has been intensively concerned with it for years.
I would like to make one preliminary remark.
My personal strategy in this connection has always been that one must be very careful about dramatic insinuations or dramatic accusations.
And I have to note to my horror â I have to say I really am horrified â that the publications of some non-governmental organisations, which are made with the best of intentions and draw attention to serious problems, have resulted in dramatic and sensational reporting in the media, especially in those countries bordering on the Czech Republic, with dire consequences.
They have resulted in a flood of sex tourists, who now go to these border areas because they have seen on television that children are reportedly offered for prostitution there, and they are now asking for children.
And I am very concerned that this sensational reporting is creating a demand for which, ultimately, a supply will be forthcoming even if there was no supply at all before.
We must therefore be extremely cautious and extremely sensitive when dealing with this question.
I am sure you agree with me.
This problem is not simply a question that lies within the sole competence of the Czech authorities and has nothing to do with us; it is a problem that belongs in the realm of police and judicial cooperation and, I am firmly convinced, also in the area of respect for human rights.
The Commission has repeatedly urged the Czech authorities to take the necessary action in the light of this.
In the 2002 progress report, the Commission notes that the Czech Government has taken important steps to combat the trade in human beings.
These included in particular improving the legal framework with an amendment to the penal code in 2002.
That change in the law widened the definition of trade and also extended it to children.
An accelerated amendment to the code of criminal procedure has also ensured that proceedings in child abuse cases are simplified and speeded up.
Back in the year 2000, the Czech Government adopted a national plan to combat the commercial sexual abuse of children and in 2003 a wide-ranging national plan to combat the trade in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation.
The implementation of these plans is kept under constant review.
The Commission has come to the conclusion that the situation in the Czech Republic, especially along the borders between the Czech Republic and Germany and between the Czech Republic and Austria, continues to give cause for concern.
In the light of the most recent reports from non-governmental organisations, the Commission is encouraging the Czech authorities to take further steps.
The Czech authorities are responsible for taking all necessary measures to prevent the trade in human beings and child prostitution.
In my opinion, the most important thing at the moment is to use effective surveillance to gain an overview of the actual situation.
That would also make it easier to track down and prosecute offenders.
This will require quite close cooperation between the competent police forces, both internally and across the borders.
I must particularly emphasise this cross-border aspect because, as I am sure you know, honourable Member, the clients do not come from the Czech Republic.
The clients come from neighbouring countries that have been members of the European Union for a long time.
The Commission is in close contact with both the Czech and the German and Austrian authorities in order to obtain precise information about the situation on the spot and to be able to respond to new developments.
Regrettably, the financing rules under which we have to operate do not allow direct assistance to be given to the victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
But the Commission does make substantial amounts of money available for fighting organised crime and the trade in human beings through the PHARE programme.
The Czech Republic has received EUR 5.5Â million for this purpose in the last four years.
Further assistance will be granted for this purpose after accession from the financial assistance instrument known as the âtransitional facilityâ.
In addition, since the year 2000 Czech non-governmental organisations have taken part in five projects under the Communityâs Daphne programme with the aim of preventing violence against children, young persons and women, including violence in the form of sexual exploitation.
Non-governmental organisations from the Czech Republic will also be able to apply for similar funding from the Daphne programme for the years 2004 â 2008.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, thank you, Commissioner, for your answer.
As the voluntary organisations say, there is every cause for feeling very concerned about the trade in women and children in the border region between Germany and the Czech Republic, but also in other parts of Europe.
This is a major and common problem which also exists in the regions bordering on the other countries that share a frontier with the present and the enlarged EU but that are not members of the EU.
I live in northern Sweden, and we have this problem in the region of the Barents Sea.
Unlike the Commissioner, I do not believe that the media reports cause the trade to increase.
I believe, rather, that it is a question of poverty and of the subordination of women. This promotes the trade in women and children.
We must work on an extremely broad front.
I also believe that legal prostitution promotes the trade in women and children.
I therefore want to see those who buy sex criminalised.
I think that this would be a sound way of proceeding.
I hear that the Commission and the Commissioner are taking this issue very seriously, and I think this is important.
I also wish to draw attention to the Daphne programme.
Does the Commissioner believe that the police in the EU countries and the candidate countries are cooperating sufficiently well in order to get to grips with this large problem?
Is there progress when it comes to police cooperation?
Â Â  . â Two brief comments, honourable Member.
I think we should not misunderstand one another.
I did not say that the media are exaggerating things.
I did say that in the specific case of information about the situation in the Czech border areas sensational reporting has resulted in demand for child prostitution becoming really visible.
I meant that as an appeal to the media to show a measure of restraint in their reporting.
I fully agree with you that it is essentially a problem of the poverty that is a consequence of the transition and that this problem is by no means confined to the Czech Republic but that there are still far worse situations in Europe.
I was in Moldova a few days ago, and there the problem is much more shocking in extent and is quite clearly a consequence of the bitter poverty in which the people there live, so the strategy of increasing the chances for economic prosperity for the countries in transition within Europe is quite certainly a right one.
The other is better cooperation in the field of police and justice.
Now so far as the specific problem in the Czech Republic is concerned, I can tell you from my contacts with the German and Austrian Governments and also from direct contacts on the spot, with police stations in Bavaria, for example, that our assessment is that cooperation with the Czech police and the Czech judiciary now satisfies the requirements.
There were times when this cooperation was not sufficiently developed.
Â Â  My Question 54, which is due to be taken later though I suspect we will not reach it, is closely related to this.
In the UK, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has produced compelling evidence that shows that paedophiles are moving from one Member State of the European Union to another to take advantage of differences in the law.
For example, in the UK there is a register for child-sex offenders.
We find that people who would not be able to work with children in the UK move to other Member States of the Union in order to take advantage of the lack of such a register.
In light of what the Commissioner has said about the need for greater judicial and police cooperation, would the Commission consider taking an initiative to create a European-wide sex offenders register, so that these people can be monitored?
Â Â  . â I do not know, honourable Member.
I do not know because that is a question that is definitely not within my field of competence and I would not like to anticipate my colleague who is competent in this matter and who has prepared to answer this question but who will be giving his answer at a later point in this question time.
Please understand that I do not have the competence to answer your question.
Â Â  . â May I on this question too make a brief political preliminary remark?
I am sometimes slightly surprised that the Commission is asked questions that give the impression that we are responsible for all possible circumstances in the future Member States, as though we had powers in areas where there is definitely no Community competence.
We are dealing here with a question where we do not even know what the situation is in the Member States.
All the same, we have been able to do something, because the Copenhagen criteria do apply for the future Member States and the Copenhagen criteria help us to take action in such matters.
But then we must always treat them as human rights matters.
I had to say that first.
So far as the problem of caged beds is concerned, which you raise in your question, the an international organisation for the promotion and protection of the rights of people with mental disabilities, presented a report to the European Parliament on 17 June.
You know that, of course.
That report points out that caged beds are still used to restrain people with mental disabilities in four accession countries, namely the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia.
On the strength of that reportâs findings, the Commission immediately contacted the countries concerned in order to investigate the present situation precisely and called on the authorities of the countries concerned to inform the Commission of the existing circumstances.
The Commission then received the information requested and it appears that the situation has already improved by comparison with the report simply as a result of the Commissionâs enquiry.
The Slovenian authorities informed us that caged beds are no longer used in Slovenia.
In Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary they are still used in a very few exceptional cases and strict guidelines must be followed.
The countries concerned have however conceded that efforts to introduce more modern methods of psychiatric care may for the present be hampered by insufficient staff resources.
The Commission has information that the Slovak Government has taken relevant measures and is at present working on a plan to phase out caged beds.
The Czech Government has assured the Commission that it is investigating the matter in detail in order to provide us with more precise information about the occasional use of caged beds.
In Hungary the number of caged beds has already fallen steadily.
The very few establishments where such beds are used are regularly monitored and ways are being sought that will allow these terrible beds to be abolished.
If I may make a brief assessment, I think we are faced here with a phenomenon that gives us a glimpse into the sometimes horrifying past of psychiatry and that we really must be shocked at what we see.
I am sure we all agree that such methods have no place in modern psychiatry.
The Commission will therefore be using every means at its disposal to pursue this matter further and we shall not cease until the last caged bed has vanished from each of these countries.
Â Â  Mr President, I wholeheartedly welcome the Commissioner's last statement, which is absolutely right.
There is no place for caged beds or anything like them in a modern psychiatric service.
I was astonished by his opening political statement.
If he does not know, I can tell him that there are no caged beds in any existing Member State.
There are no caged beds in any other accession country apart from these four.
They are a legacy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and so the only other country that could have had them in the past was Austria, and that is no longer the case.
I recently spoke at a conference in the senate in Prague when this issue was being debated.
One of the speakers was a young man called Michael, a 29-year-old who had been put in one of these caged beds for a week, unable to get out.
Not surprisingly his health suffered.
They are caged in the sense of there being iron bars or nets.
There are safety consequences, because people have died in these beds.
As the Commissioner said, it is a human rights issue.
That is why it is an accession issue.
That is why, when we looked at Slovenia, we incorporated a question about their new mental health legislation in our report of two years ago.
That is why I very much welcome the pressure that the Commissioner is putting on these countries.
Hungary has already responded; Slovenia is now responding; the Czech Republic not yet; and for Slovakia we wait to see.
Â Â  â Mr Dunn, I am happy to admit that the Commission cannot know everything.
Unfortunately there is no that would allow us to gather accurate information from the current Member States.
However, I am happy to follow up your comments.
What is more, I believe that our assessments coincide.
If you receive information about individual or recurring cases of this kind, please do not hesitate to contact me directly and in person.
I have no problem picking up the telephone in such cases and contacting the relevant Head of Government himself in order to explain what we expect from him and his country.
As regards the Czech Republic, I had an opportunity to speak to the relevant members of the government just a few days ago in the course of a visit to Prague.
I expect an answer from Prague very soon, and that will point the way forward.
Â Â  I agree with Mr Bowis.
This is a human rights issue and the European Union has certain possibilities open to it.
There are provisions in the Nice Treaty meaning that once these countries are full Member States of the EU, they can be sanctioned.
Austria, for example, was sanctioned by the European Union although it did not actually breach human rights: in fact a political party was elected with which most of us could not agree.
So the accession countries have to be warned about the possibility of sanctions being imposed on them if they continue to violate human rights.
It will speed up the process of getting rid of this unsatisfactory situation.
Â Â  I would like to remind the honourable Members that this is Question Time, and not a time for opinions or clarifications.
I say this to all of you, so that you may bear it mind, naturally.
Â Â  â As I understand it, Mrs McKennaâs political statement contains a question as to what I think of it.
It is one that I am happy to answer.
I agree with you, Mrs McKenna.
I agree with you except on one point: the European Union has never implemented sanctions against Austria.
This must be made very clear.
It was the Member States, acting as sovereign states, who introduced restrictions on bilateral relations.
The EU as such never imposed any sanctions on Austria.
Like you, I believe that we cannot allow double standards on human rights in the European Union.
This means that if we deal with a matter as a human rights issue, it will be treated as such across the board.
Consequently, if we identify human rights abuses relating to psychiatric treatment, we have to address the issue in all Member States, both new and old.
Obviously, this can still be done after accession, since the relevant Treaty provisions will remain in force â the provisions that refer to the need to obey and respect the fundamental values on which the European Union is built.
There is no doubt that these values include respect for human rights.
Â Â  â Mrs Zorba, let me start by saying that no state in the world other than Turkey recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and I have no plans to change the situation.
The elections held last Sunday therefore have to be seen as a political move which will have repercussions that could certainly be significant for us.
The Commissionâs initial response is that, three days after the elections, there is still potential for achieving a fair, lasting and viable solution to the conflict in Cyprus by 1 May 2004.
The Commission continues to urge all parties to use the Annan Plan as a basis for seeking a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.
As to how this relates to Turkeyâs application for membership, the Commission made it clear in the strategy paper published in early November that it does see a political correlation.
The Commission also noted that failure to find a solution could seriously impede Turkeyâs efforts to join the EU.
Last weekend the European Council responded positively to the Commissionâs suggestion that the two be linked politically.
However, unlike the Commission, the Council did not choose the form of a warning, but rather a reward, indicating that a solution to the Cyprus question would appreciably assist Turkeyâs efforts to join the European Union.
Of course, the underlying message still remains the same and shows the Turkish Government that not only the Commission but also all 15 Member States together with the 10 incoming States consider the two subjects politically related, without wishing to create a new condition or a new requirement.
Looking ahead to the next steps, the Commission is willing to contribute anything that will help reach a settlement rapidly and to prepare the measures needed for the speedy adoption of Community law in the northern part of the island.
Let me remind you that, in the event of a solution being found, the Commission has offered to organise an international donor conference in order to find international funds to help correct the economic and social imbalances in the northern part of the island.
I also want to emphasise that the European Union is willing to accommodate the terms of a solution in Community law and the Union has already earmarked EUR 206 million in aid for northern Cyprus to be made available when a settlement has been agreed.
To close, let me say that I fervently hope that the Turkish Government in Ankara will understand that it is in their own interest and to their advantage to support the current move to resume the discussions on Cyprus and to use the window of opportunity while it is still open.
That window of opportunity is limited, but it is still available.
However one looks at it, it would be better if Cyprusâ accession on 1 May were agreed on the basis of a political solution to the conflict.
Â Â  â Commissioner, of course I absolutely agree with your position that these are political processes and I should like to ask you about the most recent statement by Mr Giul, who said that Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side are preparing a compromise on the island which will be published next week.
These are recent statements, made yesterday or today.
I should therefore like to ask if you know any more about this compromise to which he refers and I should also like to ask you about the statement made by Mr Erdogan, who said that no one can turn a blind eye to the will of the people and that the voters wanted to turn the page.
That is how he addressed the results.
In your opinion, does this constitute acknowledgment of the victory of the opposition in northern Cyprus and do you think this marks a change in Ankara's position?
Finally, I should like to raise another issue: there was a team of observers from the law faculty of the University of Oslo, which sent an announcement today, saying that what they saw was the production of voters to increase support for the governing parties during the last elections.
I should like to ask you to comment on this issue.
Â Â  â Mrs Zorba, the Foreign Minister of Turkey was in Brussels a few days ago.
I had a long talk with him.
He did not tell me what might be contained in the compromise his government is currently seeking with the Turkish Cypriots.
Having spoken to him, however, I had the impression â and he went on to state this publicly, as did Prime Minister Erdogan â that, following the elections in Northern Cyprus, the time may be ripe for relaunching discussions on the basis of the Annan Plan.
I hope they will continue to think along these lines.
I regard Prime Minister Erdoganâs statement, which you also quoted, as a positive signal.
I can endorse this statement and say that this election clearly and unequivocally demonstrates the will of genuine Turkish Cypriots, namely those who actually live in Cyprus.
It shows that they want both a solution to the conflict based on the UN plan and also to accede to the European Union.
It would be wise and appropriate to respect the clear will of the majority of the population.
Thirdly, on the subject of the election observers and their findings, I can tell you that even before the elections I received regular updates from them regarding what they saw.
On several occasions before the elections I publicly highlighted the manipulation of the electoral registers and also asked the Turkish Government to ensure that this was rectified.
I have no doubt that the number of voters in this election was in fact artificially inflated, with the intention of manipulating the results.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your cooperation this afternoon, Mr Verhaugen.
There is a point of order.
I would ask you to make sure it is a point of order, Mr Posselt, since we cannot debate political issues during Question Time.
Â Â  â Something happened yesterday which does not belong in the Minutes, where it would merely be out of place, but rather in the full session report.
I must take advantage of you being here again.
Yesterday I addressed a question to the Italian President-in-Office of the Council and received an answer.
I then asked a follow-on question.
In the full session report, you will remember, I asked whether he was saying yes or no, and his answer was no.
This ânoâ does not appear in the full session report, although I recorded it on tape myself.
What is more, the full session report repeats the second part of his written reply, distorting the overall sense of the question time.
I would therefore ask, since I am sure you still remember this whole yes and no business yesterday, that the records be corrected.
Â Â  You are absolutely right, Mr Posselt.
I remember the question perfectly well and the answer was a definite ânoâ.
I will take the appropriate measures so that this is recorded, because the Minutes must reflect what happens in the Chamber, and not other answers which would have been given if this had not been done.
In agreement with you, I will take the appropriate measures.
Â Â  . â The decisions on the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes for Community research and their respective specific programmes do not make any provision for the allocation of a budget specifically devoted to embryonic stem cell research.
As regards the Fifth Framework Programme, there are two research projects which include activities in which it is planned to use human embryonic stem cell lines.
As for the Sixth Framework Programme, on the one hand no project has to date received funding for this type of research and, on the other hand, only one project involving an aspect of research using a line of human embryonic stem cells is a possible contender for selection following the initial call for proposals.
All the cell lines in question are existing lines and were created without the use of Community funding and outside the European Union.
The Commission does not have any other information, particularly as regards the quantity of human embryos that might be used in Member States for obtaining stem cells.
Those Member States who authorise and regulate the use of human embryos for obtaining stem cells are currently Belgium, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Decisions on the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes and their respective specific programmes authorise the financing of research into stem cells of any origin.
The European Parliament, in its resolution of 19 November this year, came out in favour of Community funding for research activities using both embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.
Â Â  Once this funding has been decided, it would be useful to have a breakdown in the way I requested, because it is very important, considering that in some Member States embryonic stem cell research is forbidden, yet some of those countries â for example, Germany â will be the main funders of this kind of research.
In the interests of openness and transparency, there should be a clear breakdown and a clear outline of how much is going where and what the results are.
Â Â  . â I am sure Mr Busquin would be more able to reply in more detail, but I shall make a general remark on how the Community research budget functions.
We do not fix issues of that sort beforehand: calls for tender are made, thematic priorities are set, assessments from independent experts are received.
