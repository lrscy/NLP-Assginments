Finally, on 'must carry' provisions, we need to find a means to allow services and channels in the public interest to be carried on cable and satellite platforms.
If we do not, then I fear the future of satellite television might be dominated by the TV culture of quiz shows featuring stripping housewives, squeezing out educational and public interest programmes.
Let us be clear: Amendment No 26 does not promote a free ride for public broadcasters on conditional access services nor indeed on imposing or mandating this.
The fact is that market conditions do not always provide 'must carry'.
It is appropriate to allow Member States to intervene if and when it is appropriate to do so.
I trust the Commission and the Council will see the merits of supporting this.
We favour a quick deal but it is conditional on the Council and the Commission accepting our amendments, which are a genuine and committed attempt to ensure that the brave new world of electronic communications is genuinely universal.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Daems, if we reach an agreement this week, it will be one of the few decisions in which the European Council' s timetables are put into effect.
That is a good reason why we should try to achieve something in this area, in contrast to what has sometimes happened with regard to other decisions about liberalisation.
I especially want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, with whom I have worked closely.
I want to agree with those speakers who have said that we are now introducing important rules for disabled users.
In certain contexts, I have felt ashamed at the fact that our rules have not been as advanced as the rules in other large markets.
I also want to emphasise what Mr Harbour said about the 'must carry' principle.
The intensity with which we have debated TV issues in recent weeks shows that it is not entirely acceptable to distinguish between content and the principles we had when we first debated convergences.
We are talking here about important cultural values in respect of which the Commission and the Member States must be able to depart even from strictly commercial rules.
We should support the compromise in the Paasilinna report.
In that context, I also hope that the Commission will apply a fairer competition policy between large and small countries than that we have seen, so that small and different markets too can continue to exist.
That is something to which perhaps not enough attention has been given.
Turning now to the issue of digital TV, I really regret the Council' s position on API for digital receivers.
In many contexts, the European Parliament has clearly given its backing to an open common and approved standard.
In this area, there is no market, as on many other issues.
The market cannot therefore be researched.
I hope that, before we vote on Wednesday, the Commission will be able to say when it is intended to take measures to bring about interoperability and genuine freedom of choice for consumers, and what it is intended that these measures should be. I therefore hope that the Commission will be able to come up with a declaration before we vote on Wednesday.
That is important for this sector' s competitiveness in relation to other sectors within the telecommunications sector.
Mr President, I would particularly like to join in thanking the Commission, the Council and all those Members involved.
Thanks to their commitment, they have achieved considerable progress in the EU's telecommunications market.
However, in contrast to what the word suggests, the term telecommunications market represents something that has not been dealt with properly, particularly in the Council common position we have before us.
What I have in mind is digital television.
I very much welcome the fact that not only the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, whose views I am conveying here, but also the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have unanimously indicated that it is simply not enough for us just to talk about attempting to avoid the danger of a digital divide in the European Union.
I am not talking about access for people with disabilities, an area in which I think significant progress has been made.
I am talking about the principle of digital access for all, and also about the interoperability of equipment, application interfaces and services.
I very much I regret this, whilst praising the Belgian Presidency for everything else it has achieved, but this is the drawback of this outcome: the course is now being set for equal access via a common standard for digital television, and we naturally need to strike a balance between developing the market and public interest obligations, and these two points of view have been taken into account by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in their opinions.
That is why I am urgently appealing to the Council, in view of this need to take cultural considerations into account, to ensure equal access for all.
I call on you to improve this part of the text, and we will then all be able to give it our unqualified support.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as everything has been said, but not by me - as they say - I will make two or three points simply to underline what has been discussed by the previous speakers.
I belong to the minority who, at first reading, were not satisfied with Article 6 of the framework directive.
The compromise that has now been presented meets with my approval.
I think a balance has been achieved between the national regulators' shadowing of the market and the Commission's right of veto, in order to stimulate the progress of the internal market, of which we are all in favour, even my group.
This represents, in our view, very much another fragmentation of the market.
I want to say something general about the modus operandi itself.
Yes, we are dealing with a very fast-moving market and rapidly evolving technology, and we have tried to take that into account by acting relatively speedily.
I want, though, just to say another word of admonition.
Parliament - by which I mean, we - should not always deny ourselves our rights in the legislative process.
We realise that from time to time, when the worst comes to the worst, but I think it must remain an exception.
I would like to highlight another point.
Mrs Hieronymi made it very clear - and, as a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I can only underline what she said - that a unitary standard for digital television, and its interoperability, are issues not only for industry policy, but also for consumers.
I have promised consumers and the general public in my constituency that we would ensure that there was a standard that would enable them to receive on one TV set everything that they wanted to see and that they would not have to install several sets.
I believe we have to go a bit further down that road.
I would like to emphasise the very demand that Mrs Hieronymi made when she spoke just now.
Perhaps the Commission and the Council can leap a bit further over the shadow thrown by digital television and reach a compromise.
Then I, too, would find it easier to vote in favour of the package as a whole.
I will end my speech there and point out that I have stuck to the speaking time allotted to me.
Mr President, it seems to me that the outcome is a vindication of the Community method.
Much of the process was kick-started and propelled by the declarations at the Lisbon Summit, but nothing would have happened if those declaratory statements had not been turned into excellent and workable proposals by the Commission.
They were then propelled forward by some superb cross-party work by rapporteurs in this Parliament and fixed as a result of innovative negotiating skills on the part of the Belgian presidency and from Mr Daems - who contrived to include a gastronomic tour of Brussels in his valiant efforts to secure consensus.
This combination was successful in dragging Member States and national regulatory authorities - some of them kicking and screaming - towards a workable pan-European approach.
That seems to me to offer some lessons for the Barcelona Summit next year: if we want to push forward the economic reform agenda in this sector and in others, we need to continue to rely on the tried and tested Community method and not resort to the intergovernmentalism that frankly was implicit in much of what the Council seemed to suggest in the negotiation positions it took on this package.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this package is actually one of the things that are absolutely crucial to the Council Presidency, and I would like to congratulate them on the commitment they have demonstrated.
We need sensible compromises, and we need them in quick order.
This is a very fast-moving market, and so we need fast decision-making processes that produce binding rulings and, above all, more legal security as well.
It is on that basis that there will be long-term investment, which is what we need in the current economic climate.
Let me just remind you that there are, at present, eighty cases pending in Austria alone, of which only two were decided by the Supreme Court.
This can hardly be the way into the future.
As I see it, the authorisation directive is about harmonisation being a very positive thing, but also at the same time about the need to guarantee rights of access.
It must be possible for the authorities to be helpful in implementing these rights if one is paying for it.
In the access directive, the open interface is of particular importance.
The independence of the alternative operators, and especially of the interface, is something that we should not underestimate in the future.
The possibility of future dynamic development in this area is of the utmost importance to small and medium-sized enterprises.
As regards universal service, we need clear definitions of universal service provisions, especially with respect to what has to be financed by the operator and what by the State; and finance by the State raises the question of whether there is to be a public invitation to tender.
I believe that these liberalisation measures are of quite particular importance to the public - in both the internal and domestic markets.
I cannot actually explain to my constituents the difference between a telephone call from Kehl to Strasbourg and one from Strasbourg to Paris.
Here, I believe, there is a lot more work for us to do.
Mr President, I very much hope that even at this very late stage, right up to the wire, we can achieve a compromise on this package between the three institutions.
Others have mentioned the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit but there are other needs for a conclusion: the needs of industry for early clarity about the new rules, the need of European citizens for cheap, efficient competitive telecommunication services, the needs of European Union businesses for education, for research, for societal applications.
I particularly want to ask about the rights of disabled users and to put a specific question to the Commission on the compromise presidency text.
It is important, not just for social reasons, but for access to employment for disabled users.
I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether in his view the presidency compromise encompasses those points of principle contained in both the framework directive and the universal service directive.
There have been serious criticisms by disabled users about non-implementation of the RTTE directive and this is a crucial point for many of us.
Parliament has rightly supported carefully delineated powers for the Commission and understands also that some qualification is essential.
There is a need for clear rules consistently applied within national regulatory authorities and between regulatory authorities.
The powers for the Commission need to be circumscribed and time-limited, as indeed they were in Parliament's amendments and in the presidency compromise.
I very much hope that when we vote on Wednesday we will have reached an agreement between the political groups and between the three institutions.
These reports will play a critical role, not just in shaping the future of telecoms but also in ensuring a greater choice in competition in the European market.
Even more importantly, I hope they will go some way, in our drive for the knowledge-based society, towards lessening the divide there is between those who have access to information technology and those who do not.
I am speaking on the access and interconnection directive which is extended to provide a pro-competitive and harmonised framework to stimulate competing network infrastructures and interoperability of services.
I hope it will ensure that bottlenecks in the market do not constrain the emergence and growth of innovative services, especially for people with disabilities and services that will benefit users and consumers.
To achieve these ambitious objectives, we first need to influence the way in which Member States regulate access and interconnection and secondly we need operators with SMP to grant other network operators interconnection facilities in a transparent way.
An area where we have had problems and where the harmonised approach between Members has been difficult to obtain under the current framework is international roaming and call termination in mobile networks.
I know that this directive may not be the place for such detailed information, however, in the absence of any movement from the operators, I believe it is important for us to highlight this issue.
The fact is the cost of terminating calls in mobile networks is ten times as much as terminating in fixed networks.
I can appreciate some of the problems in the international roaming, but the differences are too wide to be credible in terms of actual costs incurred and there is a huge spread of prices across Europe for the same service.
The most expensive country is almost twice as expensive as the cheapest.
I want to try to ensure, when we are looking at a level playing field and a single market, that the retail prices are cost-based and transparent and are of benefit to the consumer especially the SMEs who are trying to gain access across Europe and take advantage of the single market.
I hope the Commission will have greater success than they had in implementing the local-loop directive across the fifteen Member States, because this directive needs to be implemented forthwith because lower prices, wider choice and better services are an absolute priority for the EU if we are to achieve a more socially-inclusive Europe and a one-speed Europe.
Mr President, since the European Council in Lisbon, we have travelled a long way in a relatively short space of time.
The three institutions, Council, Parliament and Commission, were aware that the time factor was vital in the case of one of the fastest-developing technologies.
The directive on e-commerce has already been approved, we approved the directive on the unbundling of the local loop - which, by the way, the Member States have not yet fully complied with - but now the telecommunication business, which seemed secure, is encountering more and more problems, which is clearly not beneficial to users.
A new framework is therefore necessary.
And that is what this package of directives we are dealing with provides.
It is not a question of more regulation.
It is a question of regulating what is necessary, with a balance between consumers and operators.
But, above all, it is a question of regulating in the same way, in an equal way, in order to prevent what was happening - a fragmentation of the internal market.
That is why the European Parliament tried to resolve this problem, and the Council, in its common position, made a counter-offer, which I believe was insufficient, but now the Presidency has achieved a package which is more sufficient.
What we are being offered is clearly not ideal, it is not what we would all like to achieve, but as the saying goes, the best is the enemy of the good, and, for the sake of the certainty of the operators, for the sake of the need to have a filter in the Commission to deal with the problems of the internal market, and also, it should be said, for the sake of the good image of the operation of our institutions, I recommend that we approve this package.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the praise, in which I, of course, wish to join, there are still some large flies in the ointment, which have indeed already been mentioned.
I am speaking in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with responsibility for consideration of the authorisation and radio spectrum directives, and also as my group's shadow rapporteur on the framework directive.
All these reports have been adopted unanimously in the Cultural Committee, and we have managed to bring substantial points from our position to bear in the leading Committee as well.
In the Council, on the contrary, all the Committee's concerns have been utterly cast to the winds, which it would be an understatement to describe as disappointing.
To get to the point: even though the package of directives we are discussing is called the 'telecoms package' for the sake of brevity, it must be clearly pointed out that it certainly does not deal only with telecommunication issues in the strict sense of the word.
Technical convergence does indeed mean that electronic services cannot be divided up by reference to their channels of distribution or the devices used to receive them, but this is specifically, in our view, about digital television and other services related to journalism.
What matters to the Committee on Culture, therefore, is that the whole wide range of Europe's cultural diversity should find a place on the networks and not be merely subject to the laws of the market and of competition.
This means that we see the issue of interoperability, like that of obligations to transmit, as being essential.
By these means alone will Member States and participants in the market have the legal security to guarantee services of general interest and only thus will the provision of the full range of services for everyone be guaranteed in terms of both supply and demand.
It is self-evident that Europe, for its part, does not have a duty to regulate the content of transmissions, but it is obliged to see to it that culture is not beaten into submission by commerce.
The bottom line is that doing without interoperability does not only impose limits on culture, but positively militates against the internal market.
So the Council's compromise is inadequate in every way, and we assume that there will be more change in this area.
Mr President, I, like everybody else, or perhaps most other people in this House, want a single market.
But I do not want a market where competition rules supreme.
Regulation is necessary both economically and socially.
If you have no competition, you will have no service innovation, but if you have cut-throat competition, you will not have service innovation either.
It is necessary therefore to get the balance right.
So, I would suggest to the Commission and Council that Parliament is offering them an opportunity to improve the balance of the package before them, and I would urge them to accept the proposals being put forward by Parliament.
By coincidence, the Commission came forward today with a working document on the performance of industries providing services of general economic interest, and this also covered telecoms.
That document indicates that liberalisation in general is having a net beneficial effect, but I would suggest to the Commission that they need to come forward with a lot more research and hard evidence in relation to specific sectors to convince me that it is true in all cases.
Finally, I would suggest that the Commission needs urgently to take on board the suspicions regarding price-fixing with regard to roaming mobile telephone calls.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whenever a debate draws to its close and as important a package as this one on telecommunications is adopted, one should be, indeed must be, permitted to look into the future.
In this instance there are a number of questions that present themselves at the same time.
Is the Commission already able to assess how much the market will now change - not only in the direction of more competition?
What effects can we expect to see on jobs?
Can you, on the basis of the package about to be adopted, already estimate whether the digital divide really will be reduced?
Would what is currently going on not be an ideal opportunity to actually put transparency into practice, both as regards costs and at the consumer end?
We are indeed currently finding that the new directives mean that we will have to deal with a flood of confusing information about telecommunications charges, and transparency should surely be at least as important in economics as in politics.
The Council and the Commission exerted considerable pressure on Parliament to consider their proposal as set in stone.
However, eight amendments have been tabled by members of five different groups, which in fact proves that the basic text is insufficient.
Those who signed these amendments, supported by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, particularly want, in order to be technically fair, the broadcasting or 'must carry' obligations to also apply to satellite, the conditional access systems and to businesses providing access to digital television.
In order to safeguard legal consistency, we demand that the conditional access systems and the other associated facilities are also included in Paragraph 2, which is the purpose of Amendment No 26, the only amendment tabled by our group.
We would like to stress to the Minister that we, like everyone here, welcome the speech on reducing the digital divide, but we would also like Parliament to be permitted, now and again, to have the power of co-decision.
Mr President, electronic services are a public commodity in a modern knowledge society.
Consequently, quality, affordable services, irrespective of geographical location or the user's personal profile, must be reconciled with the demands of competition, although the basic objective must be to guarantee universal access.
Particular attention is therefore quite rightly being given to making access easier for people with disabilities.
Consultation with users is essential in order to ensure we have optimum regulations from a social point of view.
I particularly welcome the amendment requiring the Member States to hold public consultations in order to define users with disabilities. This means initiating a broad debate with individual representatives of people with disabilities, depending on their particular requirements.
So we need to focus on measures for minority users, such as providing public telephones at fixed locations or equivalent measures for deaf or speech impaired people.
At the same time, once this parameter is accepted, we need to develop quality of service standards for services for minority groups alongside general quality of service standards, because that is the only way we shall be able to monitor the degree of access which these people have to electronic services.
The four directives with you today, together with the Spectrum Decision, make up the new regulatory framework for electronic communications - a cornerstone of the eEurope strategy, the information society for all agreed at the Lisbon European Council.
Since Lisbon, successive European Councils have called on the Commission, Council and Parliament to ensure that the new framework is in place by the end of this year.
We still have two weeks to go.
Time is running short, but the EU still has the chance to meet this deadline.
The package of compromise amendments before you today has a broad level of support in the Council, as the presidency told us today.
It is, of course, a compromise.
Nobody gets everything they want - neither Parliament, the Council nor the Commission.
But the Commission nonetheless believes that it is a balanced compromise.
My assessment is that neither institution is likely to get more from conciliation.
Agreement on this package will send an important, positive signal externally.
We all know that the communications sector has had a rough ride over the last year or so.
Early agreement on this package will be a welcome boost.
The package will have a positive impact on the sector in a number of different ways.
The new framework will deregulate, requiring regulators progressively to remove regulation as it becomes unnecessary, so that they regulate only when there is market failure.
In this way, the package provides a transition to the final objective we all share: reliance on competition law to control market power in the electronic communications sector.
The new framework simplifies and deregulates national licensing regimes, removing prior regulatory control over market access for network and service provision, and focusing such controls only on frequency and numbering resources.
It preserves and strengthens universal service, striking the right balance between the rights of users and the need not to impose disproportionate burdens on operators.
In particular, it makes it clear that functional Internet access is a key part of the bundle of services that must be affordable and available to all EU citizens.
Mr Martin asked me about the impact of this solution for the digital divide and employment.
It is very clear that universal service has a key impact on availability.
But we also need policy measures which concentrate on the skills of all citizens and on content.
We need availability at a low price; we need skills and content in everyone's own language to close the digital divide.
Finally - and crucially - the new framework, with the amendments contained in the compromise package, would include the necessary safeguards to ensure that regulators act consistently across the EU, so that companies can expect to be treated similarly in similar situations throughout the EU.
Here I particularly want to thank the European Parliament for its strong support, without which we would not have been able to achieve this kind of compromise with the Council.
I will explain how the compromise package deals with the three fundamental issues that dominated discussion between the Council and Parliament during second reading: right of appeal (Article 4), the transparency mechanism (Article 6 of the framework directive), including matters related to radio spectrum, and finally interoperability of digital TV equipment - which has been raised by many colleagues tonight.
On right of appeal, the compromise package takes Parliament' s line by requiring Member States to ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account.
On the transparency mechanism, the compromise package goes a long way towards Parliament and the Commission' s position.
The text gives the Commission hard powers to require national regulatory authorities to withdraw draft measures in the key areas linked to the functioning of the single market: definition of markets and designation, or otherwise, of undertakings with significant market power (SMP).
Commission decisions are subject to an advisory committee procedure.
Radio spectrum is covered by Article 6, paragraph 2, whereby regulators are required to cooperate with each other to ensure consistent application of the regulatory framework.
The compromise does not provide for hard powers of intervention by the Commission on spectrum matters.
Nevertheless, the Commission believes that this provision, together with the Spectrum Decision, will improve co-ordination of radio spectrum policy matters across the EU.
With regard to the Spectrum Decision, the Commission is very satisfied with the compromise proposal, as the major objectives pursued in the original Commission proposal are met.
The adoption of the Spectrum Decision in this form would constitute a major step forward.
Furthermore, it demonstrates how far positions in this important matter have evolved, given the failure not so long ago of legislative proposals along similar lines.
The Spectrum Decision in its present form will set up a general and permanent framework for addressing radio spectrum policy and legal issues in the context of all relevant Community policy areas.
It thereby reflects the increasing importance of radio spectrum in the context of Community policy objectives which depend on the availability and efficient management of frequencies as a vital resource for the provision of economically and socially important wireless usage in electronic communications, transport, broadcasting and so on.
The Spectrum Decision makes it possible to take appropriate action to ensure efficient use of spectrum and spectrum management.
It also provides for technical implementing measures to be adopted under the Spectrum Decision as a mechanism to ensure legal certainty.
Many Members of the European Parliament have raised the issue of digital television.
We clearly have got the message from the European Parliament.
On digital TV interoperability, the compromise package goes towards Parliament' s position, by taking over much of the European Parliament text.
A new article and corresponding recital would be inserted in the framework directive, dealing specifically with interoperability of digital interactive television services.
It would impose an obligation on Member States to encourage the use of open application programme interfaces by platform operators and equipment manufacturers.
In addition, Member States would also be required to encourage API owners to make available, on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, all such information as is necessary to enable service providers to provide all services supported by the Application Programme Interfaces.
Clearly an obligation to encourage does not go as far as an obligation to ensure.
But - and I emphasise this - the provisions of Article 16 on standardisation allow standards to be made mandatory one year after entry into force of the directive if interoperability cannot be ensured by the use of voluntary standards.
The combination of these two provisions constitutes a step forward for the interoperability of digital television, which we all agree is a desirable outcome for European consumers.
Article 16 means that one year after entry into force of the directive, the Commission must organise public consultation then propose the comitology procedure, followed by Commission adoption.
Furthermore, as we have really understood the strong will of the European Parliament to go forward with interoperability, the Commission is ready to start actively to promote European standards for interoperability with all stakeholders concerned.
Mrs Read and Mr Fitzsimons raised the issue of the disabled here today.
Firstly, on the amendments on the disabled, most of them have been accepted in the Council position, except perhaps for two, which overlap with the Council text.
Secondly, I am personally convinced that information technologies give us better chances than before to give equal possibilities to the disabled.
When we make society better for the disabled, it is better for all of us.
Last week we had the information society technologies conference, in which Mrs Read also participated.
We saw fantastic new applications which make life for the disabled better.
We must absolutely encourage their use.
The same was true with the e-government conference.
We proceed along those lines.
The accessibility guidelines recommendation from the Commission a few weeks ago is another example here.
As far as the link between the RTTE directive and this package goes, we are ready to consider and study that issue.
I will come back to that later.
The compromise package is always a compromise.
No institution gets everything it wants.
But this compromise is a balanced one.
It represents a proper balance between the views of the Council and Parliament.
As such the Commission would recommend that the House accept it.
The Commission will transmit to the sessional services of the European Parliament the detailed position on the amendments, including those not covered by the Council compromise.
Finally, I thank the European Parliament and the presidency for their particularly close and substantial cooperation on this file.
My particular thanks go to the rapporteurs, Mrs Niebler, Mr Paasilinna, Mr Harbour and Mr Brunetta, the rapporteurs for the five telecom directives, as well as the chairman of the committee, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza.
But I do not want to forget the shadow rapporteurs and those other Members of the European Parliament who have participated so actively in the discussion of the telecoms package.
It has been an excellent example of how Community method at its best can work.
It has been an extremely complicated legal package.
Everybody had a role to play.
We worked towards the same compromise solution and - if it goes through this week - very rapidly.
The outcome of this would be that Europe would have the most modern, technology-neutral legislation for the future.
I am sure it would be good for jobs, good for growth, good for equal access for all.
I hope that this package will be accepted this week in Parliament.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I would inform Members that the services of the Bureau have a list of the amendments accepted and not accepted by the Commission.
The services of the Bureau will supply this list to any of you who wish to have it.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
Report on financial assistance for innovative and job creating SMEs
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0422/2001) by Mr Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council: Growth and Employment Initiative - Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating Small- and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (COM(2001) 399 - C5-0459/2001 - 2001/2183(COS)).
This is Parliament's second report on the growth and employment initiative which is a multiannual programme.
But it is also, perhaps unusually, the second one this calendar year and the reason for this is that the 1999 report was delayed until January of this year in essence because the Commission had been somewhat sluggish - a point I recollect I observed in my speech in January.
This year, I am delighted to say that the Commission has produced a very thorough and generally much better report and I would like to thank them for the cooperation they have shown.
Ironically, the timing has been more of a problem this time around with Parliament and that is partly because the Industry Committee decided that it wanted to produce an opinion and wrote to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee and asked if the vote in committee could be deferred.
The vote was deferred and then the Committee on Industry decided it did not want to produce an opinion after all.
But these things happen.
Anyway, I would like to thank colleagues in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for their amendments which have generally improved the report substantially.
I would like to thank the Economic Committee for their opinion which the committee fully supported and which is utterly embraced within the body of the report, and I would also like to thank the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for adopting this report unanimously a few weeks ago.
Parliament clearly hopes that its views as expressed in this report when voted on tomorrow will be of genuine help to the Commission and the EIF in determining any programme changes for the coming year, in which case the report each year needs to be presented annually in good time well ahead of the year to come so that it can influence what happens in the year to come.
The challenge for everybody in the year 2002 is therefore to present the report in the November plenary rather than in the December plenary.
The Commission can help, as I hope they will, by speeding up the inter-service consultation which still seems to be a rather dozy process.
I have it on good authority that the Commission's own report rested in certain DGs in-trays for several weeks before being lifted out so progress can be made there.
It can also help by sharing with Parliament the quarterly information from the EIF and I thank the Commission for agreeing publicly in the Employment Committee to do this.
This will be very helpful, but Parliament can certainly help in sharpening up its own act in terms of getting the timetable much sprucer next time around.
Meanwhile, I would just like to highlight three points from the report: paragraph 13 where we would like to see in next year the Commission report much more concrete evidence of the employment gains that this multiannual programme has produced, not because we doubt what those employment gains might be, but we would like to see some hard data next time around.
On paragraph 14, there are a number of references to other stages in the development of SMEs in their business cycle.
We would like attention to be paid to this too.
Finally, to go back to the earlier part of the report, in Recital F, where a deliberate comparison is made with the United States, because there, less regulation allows for a much more entrepreneurial spirit.
In the EU we believe that we have to get a much more similar mindset to America in the way in which we approach SMEs.
I note with great interest the Minutes of the Industry Council meeting on 4 and 5 December, which proudly proclaimed real progress under the Belgian presidency towards "better practices geared towards elimination of red tape".
If this is true it is most welcome.
I want to believe it.
I would love to see the evidence.
Certainly we all have to do our best to make it true.
SMEs currently account for two-thirds of all workers - the majority of all workers employed in the European Union.
But European employment laws are substantially shaped by the social partners who represent the big employers and the big trade unions but the minority of the workers.
We all need to recognise that SMEs are the biggest employers overall, that SMEs are the biggest engine of growth for the European economies.
It is not enough just to say that we have looked after SMEs, that we have the employment and growth initiative.
It is a great help but we have to do much more.
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks, Mr Bushill-Matthews, for this excellent report.
I would like to present briefly the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I do not want to devote myself to long explanations about why small and medium-sized enterprises are the economic backbone of European society.
SMEs find access to finance ever more difficult, and a look at the agreements that Basle II will bring with it leads us to assume that this finance will become even more problematic.
New methods of finance, such as venture capital, initial public offers, or all the other things currently being tried out or referred to, certainly represent a feasible way ahead, and one to which we in Europe will have to give thought, but not one to be used similarly by all SMEs.
It is for that reason that I am glad that the Commission is taking up this issue on Europe's behalf.
I would like, on the basis of my practical experience and of my discussions with many owners of SMEs, to tell the Commission of my principal concern, which is that future promotion of SMEs should also be tailored to their needs.
Many owners of SMEs have no idea, or it is very hard for them to find out, where any kind of support at a European level is to be had.
Support is meant to be transparent.
Then I often hear complaints that support at a European level is very complicated, that compliance with the requirements imposed on SMEs is very difficult and that this often made the whole thing very expensive.
Thirdly, all this should also be calculable in good time.
Very lengthy application procedures stretched over many years result in small entrepreneurs quite simply running out of breath and not making it through to the final stages of the process.
This means that everything possible needs to be done by the Commission to ensure that support for SMEs meets the needs of applicants from the target group, that is, the owners of the enterprises themselves.
At a European level, though, we can ease the burden on SMEs or do justice to them not only by offering finance, but we should also consider how we might remove the burden from them by avoiding additional bureaucracy and regulation, which weigh down on them more and more.
I believe it would be highly appropriate to put in place a screening procedure in the Enterprise Directorate-General which would make it possible to lodge a veto in good time, permitting the passage of regulations beneficial and appropriate to SMEs and excluding those detrimental to them.
Mr President, Council, Commission and Parliament at last agree on something.
The promotion of SMEs contributes to greater investment and innovation, and to the creation of new philosophies of enterprise.
A multiannual programme was started to benefit an initiative towards growth and employment.
Parliament approved a budget of EUR 450 million.
SMEs are an engine for jobs in Europe.
Seventy per cent of all workers are employed by them, and over 80% of all apprentices trained by them.
In order to give them a better chance in the market, however, more financial and fiscal burdens have to be taken off their backs.
They need improved access to risk capital.
The European Investment Bank should apply its funds not only to the knowledge-based enterprises in the multimedia and biotechnology sectors, but also to cutting-edge technologies in the environmental and energy sectors and to innovative service-providers in craftsmanship, trade and tourism.
Interest-rate subsidies paid out amount to over EUR 93 million rather than the EUR 100 million that had been envisaged, yet, all the same, 54 000 new jobs were created where 33 000 had been expected.
If that is not a success...
The excellent report that Mr Bushill-Matthews has produced meets with full support from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and my committee was unanimously in favour of it.
I echo his criticism that the report reached the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs far too late.
Obviously there were too many services dealing with it.
Parliament can, though, only take responsibility and perform its supervisory function if information is available in good time.
Future reports will have to concentrate on aspects that make effective analysis possible.
What about the quality of jobs in innovative fields?
How is sustainability ensured?
How many women - who, at the end of the day, are a significant element in the European employment strategy - are involved?
The Commission's report is encouraging, this criticism notwithstanding, providing, as it does, evidence that it is worth investing in these forward-looking sectors, and that is entirely in the employees' interest.
Thank you, Mr President.
I too should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his report.
He has made every effort to add this report to the agenda at the earliest opportunity and, as he has already indicated, he is not to blame for the fact that that is not the case.
Even the Commission has made more of an effort to ensure that that is done in time, and moreover, the content of the report presented by the Commission is more substantial than when we discussed it the first time round, because we have since gained more experience with the Growth and Employment Initiative.
The report is about this Growth and Employment Initiative and about the three financial instruments which have been developed with this initiative in mind, namely the ETF start-up facility, the JEV programme and the SME Guarantee Facility.
Just like last year, on behalf of my group, I should like to underline the social dimension in this respect.
This initiative is the brain child of the European Parliament that was developed in the wake of the Luxembourg Summit in 1997, and right from the outset, it was made very clear at the time that the initiatives should not only focus on this highly advanced technological sector, but should also embrace the social sector, and I am of the opinion that we cannot repeat this enough.
There is only one point where I cannot completely follow the rapporteur in this report, and that concerns recital F which he quotes.
He refers to the United States of America in this respect.
More investments are made in new initiatives over there, and the decision to set up one' s own business is made more easily.
I acknowledge that this is the case, but I disagree with his analysis that the reason for this would be the US' s milder regulatory climate.
In my view, this is much more related to the whole culture of entrepreneurship, the fact that people over there are used to taking initiatives, that it is not of such major concern to fail once, to go bankrupt once and start again.
In my opinion, cultural factors of this kind play a much more significant role than simply the regulatory climate.
This remark is not really appropriate, in my view.
I hope that we can find a compromise on that score at tomorrow' s vote, for it would be unfortunate if this report were not adopted unanimously.
Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I welcome the report and I congratulate the rapporteur.
I agree with the criticisms made of the Commission's report and many of the points made in relation to support that SMEs need, both by the rapporteur and by other speakers here tonight.
But the report does not deal adequately with the crucial issue of whether jobs were actually created by these financial instruments.
The amendment by my group makes explicit reference to this.
The stated intention of the SME guarantee facility is to stimulate job creation by supporting the investment activities of SMEs within the EU through increased availability of loan finance.
The estimate for job creation is an average 1.3 new jobs per SME over 2 years which is described as substantial.
But we do not have a cost/benefit analysis and enough concrete information.
I would ask colleagues to support this report but also to support the amendment which makes this point clear.
Mr President, I am going to use my speaking time to contradict the procedural page and the previous speakers who, while claiming that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs unanimously voted in favour of the Bushill-Matthews report, have attributed to me a vote that expresses the exact opposite of what I believe in.
This report is a plea to grant greater financial assistance to small- and medium-sized businesses.
I am even more opposed to the idea of giving public money to private businesses since large financial and industrial corporations are often lurking behind the all-encompassing SME cause.
It would never strike Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is known for his fervent support of the so-called free market, to propose financial assistance for workers who have been made redundant by the very same industrial and financial corporations or their counterparts.
On the contrary, the rapporteur brings out the begging bowl without compunction, so that public money can be shifted, through the SME Guarantee facility or pre-start financing, into the coffers of large corporations so that it ends up swelling the private wealth of shareholders.
To prove that Member States and the European institutions are no strangers to a bit of hypocrisy, this increased financial assistance is proposed in the name of job creation.
I shall of course vote against this report.
Public money should go to public services, to health, education, and public transport, which could and should create many more useful jobs for everyone than these start-ups, which swallow up money without showing how they are of use to society.
The health sector has been reduced to collecting public money in order to contend with some diseases.
I would like to see employers come round to collect public money.
It is not up to Parliament to give taxpayers' money to help them.
Mr President, we received with great interest the report by Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning the second annual report on growth and employment initiatives.
I very much appreciate the spirit of cooperation with the rapporteur and the favourable comments made on the annual report.
In particular, I know that the committee's report - and I quote: "welcomes generally the content and analysis within the thorough and more comprehensive 2000 report and commends the Commission and the EIF where progress has been made".
I would like to address the main points raised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the report prepared by Mr Bushill-Matthews and have grouped my comments under three headings: provision of information to Parliament and its timing, geographical coverage and an updating of the instruments.
Firstly on the provision of information.
All the completion of the formal Commission procedures for the adoption of such a report may appear too long and, frankly, sometimes it is.
The Commission has helped the rapporteur by providing an advance copy of the report before publication.
We intend to continue this practice of keeping the rapporteur informed prior to the completion of the formal Commission procedure.
We also explored to what extent we can share with the rapporteur the quarterly information received from the EIF without the need for a formal Commission procedure.
It should be noted that this quarterly information is mainly used for operational purposes.
It is to ensure appropriate monitoring of the programmes by the Commission services and cannot be relied upon to provide the same degree of accuracy and detail expected by the annual report.
Secondly, on geographical coverage.
The geographical distribution of the project signed under both the ETF start-up and the SME guarantee programmes varies considerably.
The difficulties of implementing ETF start-up in all countries of the Union stems from the different stage of development of the venture capital market in various countries, coupled with the requirement that ETF start-up only invests pari passu with at least 50% of capital provided by the private sector.
In those countries where little venture capital activity exists it is difficult, if not impossible, to meet the second condition.
In the meantime the take-up of the facility has successfully continued with another foreign investment signed and three more being processed, all together corresponding to a geographical coverage of eleven countries.
As you can see from our annual report the distribution for SME guarantee is most satisfactory.
The initial high take-up in Germany and France was attributable to the existence of well-developed national guarantee programmes in those two countries which were able to take advantage rapidly of this facility.
Thirdly, on the instruments.
The three instruments of the growth and employment initiative have been integrated into the new multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship and in particular SMES 2001-2005.
A change in market conditions prompted the Commission to suggest a refocusing of ETF start-up further upstream: seed, early stage and incubators.
Similarly, it led the Commission to propose diversification in the SME guarantee portfolios, for instance towards microloans in favour of the smallest enterprises and ICT loans that allow small enterprises to take advantage of the potential of electronic commerce.
Finally, with regard to the simplification of joint European ventures, our legal and budget experts have come to the conclusion that the Council decision on the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship does not allow simplification in significant terms.
To achieve this, a new Council decision would be required and such a decision would also need a new budget appropriation.
Before submitting an appropriate proposal to the Council on which Parliament would be consulted, the Commission services are working on a full assessment of a joint European venture.
In the light of this assessment, the competent Commission services may submit a proposal to reduce considerably the life of the joint European venture programme and so that the whole budget will not be used.
But I and my services will keep you informed accordingly of any developments in this regard.
Circulation of compound feedingstuffs
The next item is the report (A5-0421/2001) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the European Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC (PE-CONS 3653/2001 - C5-0491/2001 - 2000/0015(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, we have succeeded in gaining the acceptance of open declaration of foodstuffs.
By 'we' I mean Parliament, assuredly also with the Commission's support, but the Commission manifested a mild attack of weakness during the procedure with regard to what we considered necessary to the labelling of compound feedingstuffs.
I think that honourable Members will back me up when I state quite clearly that, if Parliament had not had the right of co-decision in this area, we would not have been able to push this through.
Quite apart from the matter under discussion, I wish, then, to emphasise that we need the right of co-decision in all agricultural policy matters so that, as we have done in this instance, we can come to sound and sensible results and make use of the expertise and political wisdom that reign in Parliament to support the Commission - and, I would expressly observe, to support a strong position taken by the Commission - to achieve satisfactory outcomes in the debates with the Council.
This issue of open declaration has come a long way.
We are now amending a directive dating back to 1979, when open declaration, which existed in Germany at any rate, was abolished at European level, and since which time I have also been active in this field, attempting to make good what went wrong then.
It is a long time, 25 years, since then, but patience is needed in politics as everywhere else.
That we have achieved this result is surely due to there having been the BSE crisis, which made it clear that farmers have to know what they are giving as feedingstuff if they are then to take on the responsibility for the feeding of their animals.
This catastrophe has taught us, in the meantime, that everything we feed to animals is itself in the food chain and is - admittedly by a circuitous route rather than directly - fed to human beings as well.
This makes it a matter of urgency that farmers should know what the feedingstuffs contain.
We then asked you, Commissioner Byrne, and also Mr Fischler, within the framework of the parliamentary procedure to install the Commission in office, where you stood on open declaration.
At the time you said: "Yes, open declaration should come into being."
Indeed it did, but it took another two-and-a-half or three years for the legislation to be tabled.
But a good thing is worth waiting for.
As I have said, the Council then withdrew the good proposal from the Commission, in which the only improvement we had made was to the positive list, and the Commission agreed to the Council's proposal for a less precise declaration to be implemented.
The result we have achieved is a change of direction - a change to the right direction.
We now have open declaration.
The 15% tolerance takes account of the industry's supplies and actual practice in order to avoid the possibility of partial rejection of feedingstuffs, but we have also made it possible for farmers to be told on request the exact composition of fodder and feedingstuffs.
We have likewise obliged the Commission to supply us with a positive list, or at least a draft positive list, by the end of next year, so that we can achieve a positive result in this area within the life of this Parliament.
There must be stipulations as to what can find its way into feedingstuffs.
I would like, finally, to express my warmest thanks to my colleagues, most especially to Mr Friedrich, the Vice-President, who chaired the Committee, but also to Mr Kindermann.
The three of us made up the negotiating delegation, and I must say that if we had not brought such determination, such a common mind, and what was almost joy, to the work in order to show for once that we too were in a position to turn our thoughts into words and laws, then all this would not have been possible.
So, many thanks.
I believe we have done a good job, and it was interesting to take part in a conciliation procedure of this sort.
We did, admittedly, say that a mountain had roared and brought forth a mouse, for, in view of what was up for negotiation, a gigantic effort was involved.
But it was good, too, to get an insight into something like that.
So, to all who took part, including our other colleagues, many thanks.
This result is something we can face our countries and our electors with.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a saying that what is good is worth waiting for, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the rapporteur, has referred clearly to the never-ending story of the matter under discussion.
It is specifically with reference to co-decision that it has at last been made clear that Parliament keeps on coming up with good ideas that find their way into work like this report on the never-ending story about the declaration of compound feedingstuffs.
We must be clear in our own minds that we are dealing here with large quantities, and therefore with a lot of money - not the European Union's money, but that of our partners in the market.
We are dealing with a volume of some 400 million tonnes of feedingstuffs, and it will help us to grasp how much we are talking about if we note that half, about 200 million tonnes, is made up of commercial feedingstuffs, and compound feedingstuffs make up two-thirds of that, some 115 million tonnes.
As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf pointed out, the conciliation procedure eventually achieved a satisfactory result on the most important points at third reading stage by involving all interested parties - something which I should like very much to commend.
As Parliament demanded, there is now open quantitative declaration, and, although the 15% is in my opinion at the upper edge of the margin, consensus has nonetheless been reached.
It was also clearly stated that the producer, must however, and I see the 'must however' as very important here, state the exact percentages involved at the customer' s request.
Thirdly, there is the positive list.
About 20 000 components have been mentioned, and the drawing up of this positive list may well be a difficult task, but it will, I think, be an interesting and important one.
More time has been conceded, and even more for formulation following the directive's implementation, but it is, I think, important that it should happen that way.
Perhaps the evaluation report would present the right opportunity to introduce further improvements, such as, for example, the possible certification of the producer of the compound feedingstuffs.
There is one more point I would like to mention, namely that the first positive list, to look at things in a European perspective, was the so-called purity law for beer.
As I have said before, it was instituted in 1486 in the area I come from, and made applicable to the whole of Bavaria in 1516.
It was a fine positive list for the production of beer, and you should put all your drive and ambition into drafting an equally good positive list for compound feedingstuffs.
So, then, particular thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, to the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Friedrich, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Kindermann for the tough and persistent negotiations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, most of us agree that we achieved a very good result in the Conciliation Committee.
I therefore wish, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to congratulate, above all, the rapporteur on his commitment to the matter in hand and, most of all, warmly thank him for cooperating so well with his other colleagues, too.
If the result is confirmed by this House as a whole, it will represent a further significant step towards greater transparency and safety in the production of feedingstuffs.
In addition to this proposal for a regulation, though, there are other reports which also deal with feedingstuffs and with regard to which negotiations are currently in progress between Parliament, the Council and, above all, the Commission.
I am thinking here only of the draft regulation on animal by-products not intended for human consumption - especially Category III, but also of the future use of leftovers from meals and waste from the production of foodstuffs.
I do think that it should continue to be possible to use these by-products, processed under secure conditions and subject to strict controls and, above all, with the stages in processing being effectively monitored, as high-quality feedingstuffs in pig and poultry production, unless the results of future scientific research suggest otherwise.
I look forward to the same willingness to compromise, not only on the part of Parliament, but also on the part of the Commission and of the Council, as was demonstrated in the process that we are discussing this evening.
Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the ELDR Group I too would like to start by warmly thanking chairman Graefe zu Baringdorf and our consultative committee, which carried out very valuable work and demonstrated in an exemplary fashion that when one believes in what one does and makes strong efforts on its behalf, one will reach one's goals.
Here, Parliament achieved what it wanted.
This is a very important matter from the point of view of the farmers; these are the people who in their everyday work have to deal with these matters, and this information is very important to them.
As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf stated, in Germany open declaration was eliminated in 1979, while here in Finland it was eliminated in 1995.
Now it is being reinstated.
The only matter which generated debate and which deserves a moment's consideration is this list of permitted substances, and, in particular, the fact that the various ingredients change all the time. These include the byproducts of the food industry which Mr Kinderman mentioned; new feedingstuffs arrive all the time, while others disappear.
For this reason, some sound common sense will be called for here.
We must take thought and find out what is right and what is good, and only after that, on the basis of experience, must we go about implementing matters.
Once again my warm thanks go to the consultative committee, which carried out splendid work from the viewpoint of Parliament and, particularly, from that of the farmers.
Mr President, I, too, am of the opinion that this was a good report, and that the result from the Conciliation Committee opens the way to implementation, which, however, I am sure will take some time yet.
The Community's Member States are still, in any case, responsible for the monitoring of feedingstuffs, and, as the parties in this whole process represent very diverse interests, it will be necessary, within the foreseeable future, to discuss monitoring programmes which will standardise supervision of feedingstuffs composition and norms across the board.
I am grateful for the key data laid down in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with my own experience.
What worries me, though, is the apportionment of costs, specifically the costs of the declaration itself and for the monitoring of it.
I wish to put on record my opposition to the costs continuing to be offloaded onto the farmers.
I take the view that the transparency principle means that implementation of the procedure must involve the producers of feedingstuffs, its importers, dealers in it, and, above all, those who monitor it - who will be numerous - also themselves guaranteeing the apportionment of their costs.
It is also my opinion that there should be safety standards in the production of feedingstuffs to guarantee and safeguard the health of people and animals, ensuring that no products come onto the market that are dubious from the point of view of health and consumer protection, which, of course, presupposes the principle that good technical production practice does not start, and is not interrupted, at purely arbitrary points.
I do think that apportionment on this basis at every production site must prove itself in the next few years and I hope, after this report and after the positive result achieved in the Conciliation Committee, that there will not be another scandal somewhere or other in the foreseeable future, whether in wine, honey, or the many feedingstuffs we can expect to be listed, be they positive, negative, coloured green or anything else, for the list will surely be an enormous one.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to congratulate the European institutions and the members of the conciliation committee who, under the presidency of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck - who I would have liked to have been here -, who have been able, sparing no effort, to unite differing views in order to reach a reasonable compromise between the two basic positions which initially seemed incompatible.
That is to say, firstly, the obligatory declaration of all raw materials, with a tolerance level of 15%, and the obligation of feed producers to communicate the exact percentages, whenever required by animal farmers, to which I believe we should add a time limit, set previously in this legislation, and, secondly, the positive list - which all the previous speakers have mentioned - which the Commission must present before the end of 2002, once the viability studies have been carried out.
When it comes to restoring consumer confidence, following the recent food crises (BSE, dioxins, etc.) absolute transparency is necessary, even indispensable.
However, ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of how, within the scope of the codecision procedure, it is possible to reach reasonable agreements - good agreements, I would say - and we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will therefore continue to ask the Council to gradually extend that procedure to all legislative actions in the field of the Community' s agricultural policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by warmly congratulating the rapporteur and Parliament's Conciliation Committee, whose stubbornness has in the end produced a creditable result.
Almost two years of negotiations with the Commission and the Council within the framework of the conciliation procedure have at last enabled us to reach a compromise on regulations on the labelling of compound feedingstuffs.
When this House votes tomorrow on this directive, it can do so, I believe, with its mind very much at ease.
I see this directive as proof that Parliament must in future have a right of co-decision in agricultural matters as well.
As we are all aware, the crucial issues were the open declaration, the positive list and an evaluation report.
Parliament's main concern was to lay down exact regulations on labelling that would provide for compulsory details of both the quantity and quality of ingredients.
Even with the Council, which did not originally share this position, a compromise text could eventually be agreed on, according to which the ingredients must now be stated by percentage of weight with a margin for error and according to which farmers must be given the exact percentages if they request them.
This binding statement of permissible ingredients is the only guarantee that consumers can in future have greater confidence in farmers' products, and we farmers know how much we need consumers' approval and trust.
The positive list to be produced by the end of 2002 should make that possible.
On the positive side, I would like to make the additional observation that Parliament must also be involved in any future amendments to the directive.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having gone through two readings and the conciliation procedure, the report on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs now prescribes the open declaration, and the Commission has to produce a proposal for a positive list for feedingstuff ingredients by the end of 2002.
Both these points had been at the core of Parliament's concerns, but had initially been rejected by the Council.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report is the very model of successful legislative work by Parliament and the Council.
In spite of all the differences between the political groups, constructive collaboration made it possible to draw up points that were important to us members of Parliament's agricultural committee, and the final result was a positive one thanks to circumspect negotiations in the conciliation procedure, guided by our Vice-President, Mr Friedrich, whom I would like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking.
This was the right step in the right direction.
Not only was it possible for Parliament to see its two core concerns accepted, but the Council also had positive elements to contribute.
The possibility of a + 15% tolerance margin for feedingstuff ingredients is something I see as acceptable, in that the manufacturer must state the exact percentages at the customer' s request.
Equally in line with good practice is an evaluation report after three years and, if need be, adjustment of the tolerance margin in the light of scientific and technical developments.
It would be desirable if we could make greater future use of the co-decision procedure on CAP matters and continue to work together as constructively.
Whatever our successes, I would like to conclude with the single warning that good European rules are of no use unless they are monitored.
The BSE and dioxin crises do not in some way reflect faults in European regulation; they were, rather, the result of criminal and questionable practices, which we must counter with determination and in new ways.
Mr President, honourable Members, we all agree that agribusinesses in the EU should maintain their commitment to satisfy the legitimate expectations and demands of both the farming community and consumers.
The marketing of compound feedingstuffs today has certainly improved in terms of traceability and transparency of composition - two issues of great concern for our major customer, the European citizen.
These principles can apply to all feeds to animals.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf says farmers must know what is in their feed, Mr Kindermann applies this to slops and waste and catering waste and I fully agree with those statements.
This piece of legislation is one of the milestones needed to build certainty and confidence.
Farmers are entitled to basic information to be able to properly inform their customers.
From the very beginning, the Council encountered great difficulties in agreeing on a common position.
Most Member States were opposed to this obligation and the positions of Parliament and the Council were quite far apart.
At the time, with a view to reaching a compromise, the Commission accepted the Council's position which finally had the unanimous support of all the Member States.
This led to a difference in view between Council and Parliament after the second reading in April.
I am pleased, however, that an acceptable solution has been found in the conciliation with the declaration of all feed materials under their specific name indicating the exact percentages with a tolerance level of around 15%.
However, as regards the demand for a positive list of feed materials, I have already on several occasions outlined the Commission's reservations.
This concerns especially the deadline of presenting a proposal by the end of next year.
This task is very complex.
The Commission has already launched a feasibility study on this issue.
The call for tenders was published last June and the contractor is currently working on the matter and will also contact Members of this Parliament.
I accordingly undertake to send the report on the outcome of this study to the Council and Parliament as soon as possible and in any case before 31 December, 2002.
I cannot, however, guarantee that I will be in a position to present a legislative proposal on the establishment of a positive list.
For this reason, it has been necessary for the Commission to make a declaration on this subject.
Thank you very much Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 9.30 p.m.)
Vote on requests for urgent procedure
I now give the floor to Mr Katiforis, who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Katiforis (PSE).
Madam President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has considered how we should continue to work on this directive after we rejected the Commission proposal in the last plenary by a considerable majority.
According to the regulation, we have two months in which to deliberate and then come up with a reply.
The Economic Committee has given me until Monday to complete my negotiations with colleagues, the Commission and the Presidency.
From what I see, there is no urgency in the matter because in any case the political agreement supposedly reached in Council on the matter is not set to begin before July.
There is therefore plenty of time for negotiation and for making contacts, and 15 January - when we shall reply - is not too far away.
Therefore, I see no particular need for urgent procedure and my proposal is that we reject the urgency request.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
Proposal for a Council decision on an exchange of letters between the European Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) concerning additional funding in 2001 under the current EC-UNRWA Convention for the years 1999-2001[COM(2001) 741 - C5-0663/2001 - 2001/0288(CNS)]
President.
I will now give the floor to Mr Wynn who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible, the Committee on Budgets.
Madam President, last night the Committee on Budgets and, I understand, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy discussed this matter.
There is no problem with urgency being granted and we can do it without report and without debate.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Draft Council regulation on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism[COM(2001) 569 - C5-0665/2001 - 2001/0228(CNS)]Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs
President.
I will now give the floor to Mr Watson who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Colleagues will recall that we dealt with this matter in urgent procedure in October.
I am pleased to be able to report that the Council has now accepted the legal base that was being proposed.
However, we would contest the fact that neither of the two appendices is attached to the proposal, although we understand the reasons why.
Nonetheless, we discussed this in committee last night and we recognise the urgency.
We would propose an urgent procedure without report.
It would then be up to the political groups to put forward amendments, which might be similar to those we adopted in October.
(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)
Presentation by Mr Prodi of the Commission work for the 2002 programme and the communication on the future of the European Union and strengthening the Community method
The next item is the Presentation of the Commission work for 2002 programme and the communication on the future of the European Union and strengthening the Community method.
I now give the floor to Mr Prodi, President of the Commission.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the annual debate on the State of the Union is one of our most important debates and, this year, it is taking place at a key moment for the European Union.
In recent days and months, a Greater Europe has truly been taking shape.
In less than twelve months, it will be possible to conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries that have satisfied the criteria set for enlargement, which will mean that the Union will be able to welcome up to ten new Member States before the next European elections.
In less than three weeks, the euro, the strongest and most visible sign of both the economic and political union of Europe, will become a tangible reality.
Lastly, before the end of the week, the Laeken European Council will take the decision to set up a Convention, which will do the groundwork for the reform of the Treaties and, for the first time, bring together representatives of governments, national parliaments, the European Commission and this House.
This greater Europe which is taking shape is a united, democratic, forward-looking Europe.
The Commission has been working towards this in the year now drawing to a close and intends to continue to do so in the year that will shortly commence.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, before moving on to the work carried out by the Commission in 2001 and our programme for 2002, I would like to stress once again my belief that full, transparent cooperation between the institutions is essential for the smooth running of the Union.
With this in mind, as early as January this year, I told you of the Commission's intention to revitalise our method of working together in order to make cooperation between our two institutions even more effective and transparent.
Before setting out these proposals, I would like, however, to go through the fundamental principles on which, I believe, our cooperation must be based.
Firstly, the Commission's right of initiative must be safeguarded, as it is one of the pillars of the Community structure and the guarantor of its integrity.
A strong Commission means a strong European Parliament.
Secondly, the tripartite nature of interinstitutional cooperation must be safeguarded.
Indeed, it will only be effective if the two legislative bodies - Parliament and the Council - can enter into dialogue with the Commission on a common basis of transparency.
I would now like to turn to my proposals for revitalising the system, which, I am sure, will help to greatly improve dialogue between our institutions.
Firstly, from this year on, the work programme will no longer be a catalogue of planned legislation for that year; it will, as you have requested, be a genuine political programme.
This programme, which the Commission hereby undertakes to follow closely, sets out both the priorities for the year in question and the initiatives needed to accomplish them.
I know that some of you were surprised not to receive an annex to the 2002 work programme listing planned legislation, as has been the case in previous years.
However, I want to point out that we listened very carefully to the views many of you expressed in this Chamber on 13 February.
You asked the Commission, quite clearly, to abandon the method of listing legislative proposals employed thus far and to adopt a new method.
We have made sure we complied with that request.
For these reasons, which were also set out in writing by Mrs Fontaine on 10 September, we have replaced the catalogue with the much more reliable instrument of quarterly programming, which is what the College uses to plan its work and of which you will be informed at regular intervals.
To maintain perfect transparency, however, I have also asked the Secretary-General of the Commission to forward immediately to the Secretary-General of Parliament the preliminary list of proposals put forward by the Commission departments which formed the basis for the work programme for 2002.
If this approach produces positive results, we are willing to use it in future years as well.
Secondly, it is equally important to point out that, in future, the preparation of such a programme will need to be based on a more structured dialogue between our institutions.
This is why we have planned a multi-stage approach for the forthcoming year, with the preparation of the work programme for 2003 starting at the beginning of 2002.
The two key dates for this political dialogue will be in February, when I will come to present to you the political priorities approved by the Commission for 2003, and November, when I will come to set out to you the work programme the Commission has adopted on the basis of these priorities.
The discussions at the Conference of Presidents have shown me that we are in agreement on the broad outline I have just described.
For our part, we will make a start as soon as possible on establishing the details and commencing practical implementation.
Mrs de Palacio, who, at my request, has begun a dialogue with you on this matter, will continue her work and the dialogue with the aim of concluding our agreement next January.
Lastly, I feel it is important to stress that breaking the process down into stages should not increase our respective workloads but should enable us to continue to assume our respective responsibilities.
With regard to the 2001 budget, the list of what has been done over the course of a year is too long for me to give you a detailed account here and now.
I shall therefore confine myself to focusing on the areas in which the Union, with a decisive contribution from the Commission, has achieved its greatest successes in 2001: the preparations for the changeover to the euro; the progress made in the enlargement negotiations; relations with the Balkan countries; the dialogue with Russia; the opening of a new round of trade negotiations at Doha; the adoption of a strategy for sustainable development which goes far beyond the mere adoption of a series of specific measures and which will gradually bring us to review all our internal policies; and lastly, the reinvigoration of the process of creating a common European area of justice and security, which has had a particularly high profile since 11 September.
Throughout the year, in each of these fields, the Commission's actions have benefited from the crucial support of this House.
Looking ahead to 2002, to give you a clearer picture of our tasks for the coming year, I am also sure that you will allow me to present the seven priorities indicated by the Commission in its work programme for 2002 by grouping them under four key headings.
These four major areas are internal security, the euro and economic and social matters, enlargement and, lastly, the Future of Europe debate and the process of reforming the Union' s institutions.
The annual strategy we drew up last February revolved around six priorities.
However, the events of 11 September - and you will all understand that any programme must be flexible if it is to deal with unforeseen circumstances - forced us to adopt a seventh.
Therefore, in 2002, the Commission will present a number of measures to combat terrorism and organised crime and to safeguard the security of our citizens.
They will include the launching of an integrated system for external border controls, the development of civil protection, public health measures and steps to improve transport safety.
As I have already had the opportunity to say, when speaking at Bruges on 12 November, improving judicial and police cooperation will lay the foundations for the creation, in the longer term, of an integrated police force to combat organised crime and terrorism.
Ever since the beginning of its term of office, this Commission has included among the four cornerstones on which its work is based, the aim to extend Union action, hitherto primarily economic, to cover economic, social and environmental concerns.
The programme for 2002 will not depart from this objective.
The introduction of the euro will be the most significant as well as the most tangible step towards European integration.
In this connection, I am particularly pleased that it has been possible to overcome all the political differences regarding cross-border payments, with the result that President Fontaine will shortly be able to announce the adoption of a common position.
Thanks to the efforts made to prepare for the introduction of the euro, our economy is now strong, stable and, at the same time, the most open in the world.
What would have been the impact of 11 September if we had not had the euro?
Stability is the basis for our future policies and we must safeguard it.
The current economic situation is, of course, by no means easy, but I feel sure we will be able to overcome any short-term problems.
We have the instruments to do so, and here I am referring, in particular, to the Stability Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines.
We must, however, consider the need to improve the coordination of the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone.
With the introduction of the single currency, our economies have never been as interdependent as they are now.
With this in mind, I said recently that it might be advisable to concentrate on developing a code of conduct which would take specific account of the interdependence of the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone and would improve the overall coherence and the credibility of our economic policy.
My major concerns relate more to the long term.
Europe does indeed need structural reform.
It is the prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation.
We already have the right recipe.
In two fundamental steps, both completed during the first part of this Commission' s term of office - at Lisbon in March 2000 and at Gothenburg in June 2001 - the Member States undertook to work towards sustainable development that can combine competitiveness, social justice and respect for the environment.
The Commission' s work programme for 2002 confirms this line of action.
The implementation of the undertakings given at Gothenburg is one of the seven priorities identified for next year.
Our commitment to preparing for and making a success of the meeting in Johannesburg on sustainable development is consistent with this course.
So where do these worries stem from?
From the delays between the official adoption of the decisions and their practical implementation.
The boulder blocking the course of the development of Galileo, an essential initiative and technology for the growth and competitiveness of the European economy, is only the latest on a list of obstructions that is now simply too long.
There is no need to mention them all; one example will suffice: the European patent.
The inability to fulfil solemnly given and announced undertakings and the lack of will to proceed along the road towards final completion of the single market are costing Europe very dearly. The cost of the failure to deliver on Europe, which we could call the failure to deliver on Lisbon, is rapidly becoming intolerable.
The annual economic report that the Commission will present in just over a month' s time, indeed as part of the preparations for the Spring Council, will contain a detailed analysis of the situation, and substantial progress will, at last, have to be made in Barcelona.
However, as I pointed out in Bruges, on its own, the Commission can do nothing. The Member States need to assume their responsibilities and make the decisions that are incumbent upon them.
Parliament too, moreover, will have to play its part: I am still convinced, for example, that the failure to reach an agreement on the new public procurement legislation has hindered the development of our financial markets.
In this sector, the European economy is clearly weaker than its American counterpart.
The Commission is aware of the numerous factors that combine to make the economy healthy and, in 2002, it will present particularly important legislative proposals regarding banking and financial services.
We will also present a strategy for consumer protection and measures to support private investment in research and development.
One currency, one financial market and one economic policy, this must be our objective.
In any case, our main worry concerns an essential requirement for social cohesion, employment.
This will be the case in 2002 and will remain so for many years to come.
This is why, in Barcelona, we will present a communication on the social aspects of the restructuring of companies, aimed at the social partners, as we are convinced that there is a positive correlation between social protection and competitiveness.
Completing the enlargement process and making it a success for the whole of the Union, that has been the Commission's number one priority since it first took office.
It was on 13 October 1999 when, addressing this same House, I called upon the European Council to complete the reforms necessary for enlargement before the end of 2002 and stressed that the Commission was confident that negotiations with the countries fulfilling the accession criteria could be concluded by that date.
Today, the date of 2002 has been formally endorsed by the Union.
The progress achieved in the course of two years has been impressive.
We still have before us, as I am only too aware, further stages in the negotiations that will be extremely sensitive - I need only mention the chapters on the Structural Funds or agriculture - but over the next twelve months, to those countries whose efforts have brought them to a state of readiness, the door will, at last, open, allowing them to join before the next elections to this House.
Two thousand and two will be a pivotal year, then, and the Commission's programme faithfully reflects its importance.
This is not only because, as I pointed out just now, we must forge ahead with the negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion; it is also because we must gradually begin to identify, for each of the common policies, the objectives and instruments made necessary by the new situation of an enlarged Union with new Member States.
In the course of 2002, but even more so in 2003 and 2004 (and the same will apply to our successors in the years after that), we will have to bring about a genuine 'intellectual revolution' .
It is our discussions, our plans and our action that will shape the greater Europe.
It is essential for the Commission to adjust to the new dimensions of Europe, but it is just as important for the other EU institutions and for the Member States of the Union to do so as well.
We must explain this new situation to our citizens to help them overcome their anxieties and make them aware of the human, cultural and economic opportunities offered by enlargement.
From an economic standpoint, enlargement is one of the few games in which all the players stand to win.
It will bring an increase in growth not only for the new Member States but also for the Fifteen.
Of course, the impact of enlargement within the Union will vary from one country to another and from one region to another.
Thanks to the single market, however, the benefits will be visible everywhere.
However, it is not enough for this greater Europe just to expand geographically to the east and the south.
It must continue on the path of gradual rapprochement with the Balkans and project an arc of stability from its own gates towards Russia and the Ukraine and towards the Mediterranean.
In preparation for the meeting in Valencia in April, the Commission will table proposals for improving the functioning of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, particularly in the fields of education and culture.
Also in the course of next year, it will propose measures for stimulating investment, improving cooperation in the field of immigration and strengthening the Union's role in the Middle East peace process.
Enlargement is an accomplishment of historic significance.
However, it must not lead to paralysis of the Union.
This is the background against which the debate on European governance is taking place, a debate that the Commission helped to launch with its White Paper.
It is crucial that the dialogue between our two institutions on the issues raised by the White Paper and the ensuing action should continue, and the work programme for 2002 lays down the details of this.
The debate on Europe and on the future has, however, spread well beyond the confines of the White Paper and has taken on a more clearly Constitutional tone.
Moreover, right from the beginning of its mandate, this Commission has fought for renewed vigour to be injected into the institutional debate in the Union.
As early as September 1999, addressing you here in this same Chamber, I insisted that the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2000 should adopt a broader agenda, above and beyond the 'Amsterdam leftovers' .
At that time, I told you of my fears that the IGC would merely tinker with the machinery and not give us effective tools to take decisions.
After the essential but undoubtedly minimal agreement reached in Nice, the Commission, along with Parliament, immediately lent its support to the idea of a Convention, something which has now been generally agreed.
I warmly welcome this development because I am firmly convinced that this is the right path to take if we are to build the new, more democratic, more transparent Europe.
In the meantime, a wide-ranging debate on the future of the Union is already taking place in all the European countries, and that debate must be ongoing and must provide input for the work of the Convention.
The time when we could go on putting off the necessary reforms until tomorrow, as if events would always unfold slowly enough to await our decisions, is over.
A major contribution to this discussion has already been made by the Mendez de Vigo and Kaufmann report and by the plenary debate which Parliament held on the topic.
In preparation for the Laeken Council, the Commission presented a communication on 5 December.
As we explained in that document, which is intended merely to provide a few pointers for the debate, the key to the problem lies in renewing and strengthening the Community method.
Our aim should not be to interfere with the balances that have been built up over the last fifty years. Rather, what we should be doing is modernising our system and enabling the peoples of Europe to identify with it.
What the Convention should, in my view, produce is a coherent text, underpinned by its own logic, not a mere shopping list; a text adopted by consensus, which therefore does not seek unanimity at any price and which, to avoid scaling down its essential ambitions, voices minority views where necessary; a simpler, more easily readable text which clearly sets out not only the principles guiding our action - and the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be at the heart of those principles - but also the goals to which we are aspiring; a text which makes the way in which the European public authorities work more transparent, that is which gives a clear description of both the institutions and the instruments necessary for achieving the objectives they are assigned; and lastly, a text that is capable of evolving and is therefore, to this end, a combination of a set of fundamental rules and some more technical provisions.
Before the Convention begins its work, the Commission will state its position on many issues, such as the powers of the Union and of the Member States, the strengthening of Parliament's legislative role, the distinction between the Council's executive and legislative functions, and the Commission's executive tasks.
The extension of majority voting, the procedures for revising the Treaties and the Union's own resources are other issues that also form part of the political debate and will have to be addressed in the near future.
Before leaving the subject of the forthcoming Convention, I would like to focus for a moment on an issue that is usually summed up by one word: the Constitution.
For me, what is essential is not the name eventually given to the text that grows out of the work of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. My objective is that that text, by virtue of its content and thanks to the open, democratic nature of the process that generated it, should ultimately be regarded by everyone as having the force of a Constitution.
I am confident that the work programme for 2002 will provide the foundation on which, over the next twelve months, our two institutions can build a relationship of close, constant, fruitful cooperation.
Thank you Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
I would like to thank you for your previous kind words and for the positive assessment you have made of the cooperation between your presidency and the European Parliament.
I think it is fair to say that we share this assessment and I would also like, in this regard, to underline to Members of this House that, to my knowledge, this is the first time that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has participated in the debate on the Commission' s work programme for 2002.
This is a very positive step, and I would like to welcome you and thank you.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is not really all that common for the political group chairmen to express praise and appreciation.
Normally, if we praise someone and express our appreciation for anyone, it is for the President of this Parliament.
We often have occasion to express our thanks and praise for her.
However, today I would like to say a word of appreciation to the Council, and to you, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, for being here today for the first time, as our President has just said.
Last time round I was critical because the Council was not represented.
If the Council pursues a good policy, even if it concerns working methods, then that deserves our appreciation.
You are a Belgian; you represent the Belgian Presidency.
I would like to thank you very sincerely on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats not only for being here today, but also for the committed way you have worked during your presidency.
I would now like to address the President of the Commission.
We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have a very high regard for the President of the Commission, for his personal integrity and for his positive attitude.
However, if we want to achieve joint successes, these successes have to be based on truthfulness and on sensible working methods and structures.
Mr Prodi, you know of course that the political groups in the European Parliament prepare each part-session here in Strasbourg by means of their work in group meetings in Brussels.
Many members of my group said last week in Brussels, when we were doing our preparatory work, that the 2002 work programme was on the agenda, but where was the document that we could have used to prepare for this debate in Strasbourg?
Many members were in favour of striking this debate from the agenda.
Mr Prodi, I have to tell you that this should not happen again, we must never again find ourselves without a working document for such an important debate.
I would ask you to ensure in future - and this is not just your task as President but rather one for the Commission as a whole, and for your staff - that documents are made available in good time and that the European Parliament is treated seriously, so that we can work in a reasonable way, which is in both our interest and yours.
(Applause)
Reasonable working methods are essential if we are to succeed here.
If we do not have reasonable working methods and structures, we do not have any chance of succeeding.
We want to work towards joint success because we are firmly convinced that the Commission and this House, as committed advocates of the Community method, need to work towards the same goals.
So if you have any colleagues who do not take Parliament so seriously, it is therefore in their own interest to consider whether working methods should not be restructured in their field.
We are not just offering you and your fellow Commissioners a hand; we also need a sensible form of cooperation if we are to achieve joint successes.
For that reason, relations between Parliament and the Commission need to be in good order.
That is something that you want as well, but in that case the fine words that we certainly appreciate also need to be matched by specific practical action when it comes to cooperation.
A programme like the one we have before us deserves to be supported by all the Members of the Commission, and indeed we have five Members of the Commission with us today, which is more than usual, but this programme covers all areas of work in 2002.
You yourself said that you are effectively the European government, an idea with which we in our group have a great deal of sympathy.
However, if you are effectively the European government, then the whole government should be here, with all your Members.
I would very much welcome it if that were the case next time.
Mr President of the Commission, when we are setting our agenda during the meeting of political group chairmen, we often hear that Commissioner A, B or C cannot be here in Strasbourg at such and such a time.
I really must urge you, given that we are only talking about four days each month - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday - to ensure that all Members of the Commission keep those days free.
If Parliament asks for Commissioners to be here, then they should come, and the excuse that they have other commitments is not acceptable.
Parliament should have priority over any other commitments the Commission may have.
There are of course exceptions - I say that because I see Commissioner Lamy is with us - when there are major world conferences on the international calendar, such as the Doha Conference, which Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler of course have to attend.
We are not insisting on this point 100%, but basically speaking Parliament must have priority over other Commission activities.
If I may now turn to the substance of the programme, Mr President of the Commission, we largely support what you have said.
We are in agreement, and for that reason we should cooperate sensibly and effectively.
We now expect, like you, that next weekend in Laeken the Heads of State and Government will give the Convention an ambitious mandate so as to achieve a really positive reform of the EU institutions.
We recommend that an early start should be made on this work, at the end of February or the beginning of March, so that the Convention can be concluded at the end of 2003 under the Italian Presidency.
We also support what you have said about enlargement.
Up to 10 new countries could be included in the first round.
This is not the time to say which those countries will be.
However, we do not agree with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs when he says that we should accept all the Central European countries, as when we make a decision on this in autumn 2002, we can only accept those countries which meet the conditions.
Those countries that do not meet the conditions cannot yet expect to join the European Union.
It is not acceptable for countries like Hungary to have to wait because other countries are not yet ready.
Those countries that do meet the conditions should not be held back because other countries are not yet ready, and we hope that the decisions made at that point will be the right ones.
We also fully support your comments about the Mediterranean region. We need to work with great commitment under the Barcelona Process, which is becoming ever more urgent and involves an ever greater contribution to stability.
You mentioned how important stability is for us if we want to make Europe truly competitive, because it is not enough for us simply to declare that the European Union is to become the most competitive area in the world.
We also have to take the necessary structural measures, and that means in particular strengthening Europe as a location for investment.
There should not just be tax incentives for major corporations, but also for medium-sized companies, so that they too can invest, and when investments are made that leads to the creation of jobs.
I shall wind up now, Madam President.
We have an ambitious programme, we support the Commission and we call on the Commission and the Council for us all to work together, as there should not be any competition between our various institutions, because we are all committed to the same Europe, and that is why the Commission, the Council and Parliament must each fulfil their own responsibilities.
We are prepared to do so, and will support the other institutions when they do the same.
(Applause)
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her management during the Belgian Presidency and say that it truly demonstrates, in this case, that being a former Member of the European Parliament is good training for managing European affairs within a government.
I believe that this is a type of training with a future.
Having said that, Mr President of the Commission, we must resolve the disagreement between us with sincerity and frankness.
At the beginning of the legislature, my group asked the Commission to present a political programme for the purposes of the vote on its investiture, and that programme, as we said at the time, had to lead to an adjustment of the annual programme, not only in legislative terms.
What happened the other day in the Conference of Presidents, however, and what has happened again today, requires clarification.
We have not asked you not to present the legislative programme, nor after the deadline.
What we have asked is that you present a political programme, and you have produced a working programme: this is all very well, and we take note of it, but we also want a legislative programme, because we are one of the parties to codecision.
And proof that we were right lies in the fact that I was told, last night, by e-mail, that the legislative programme had arrived as an annex.
It is important that we are able to respect the deadlines and agreements we are party to and, on that basis, you can organise the work as you see fit: by means of 'planning' , 'programming' , 'rolling on' , or whatever you want.
I very much fear that the number of officials filling in forms is going to increase. But that is your problem.
You must fulfil your commitments to Parliament.
In this respect, Mr President, I must say that you must improve the department or service of your secretariat which deals with mail, because we have raised a parliamentary question on how you are going to deal with the issue of the flax fine, specifically in Spain, and four Group Chairmen, despite the fact that the Liberal Group and the PPE-DE Group have blocked this question, which should have been seen in this House, have written to you and we are awaiting a reply.
It is important - and I am happy that the Vice-President of the Commission is here - that we do not allow issues to fester.
I would therefore be grateful if you could be more diligent with regard to this issue.
These problems relating to the programme are mere child' s play compared to the current situation.
We are on the eve of the Laeken Summit and the fundamental issue is the defence of the Community method.
And I say this because dark clouds are appearing on the horizon.
Yesterday in this House, on behalf of my group - and I am pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council is here - we strongly supported the Belgian Presidency of the Council and the Council itself with regard to an issue which we feel is very important - I believe that President Verhofstadt is in Rome today - and that is that we manage to introduce, as fifteen countries, the anti-terrorist legislation which this Parliament, the Council and the Commission have supported.
We believe that this is an important defence of the Community method. If it is not done by 15 countries, it will be done by 14.
We would prefer it to be 15, but this is an issue on which we clearly support them.
We are also currently concerned about the fact, and I am referring to a point which Mr Poettering highlighted yesterday, that certain governments, of Austria and Italy, are opposed to democratic criteria appearing in the statute on political parties.
With regard to Laeken, Mr President of the Commission, the most interesting part of your speech was the final part, when you not only supported the Convention, but you gave it content, in complete agreement with the approach contained in the Leinen-MÃ©ndez de Vigo report.
In relation to the Convention, I would ask you to defend what you have said here today in the European Council in Laeken, to make a coherent proposal and that that proposal, even if it has to be cooled down and digested, is not left on the shelf.
I would like to know how that is going to be coordinated with the timetable for enlargement and the reform of the Treaties before 2004, and what your position is with regard to the membership of the praesidium of the Convention.
Furthermore, finally, do not leave the secretariat of the Convention to the Council; we must all participate in it, because a broader distribution always brings the best results.
And, in this respect, Mr President, I would ask you to expand on the replies you have given in relation to the Convention.
You call on Parliament and the Commission to work together - and I believe we can do great things in defence of the Community method - but it is important that you have the courage and the capacity to make use of your monopoly on initiative, which must not simply be a monopoly on operation, but which must be a means for achieving what you have proposed: texts of constitutional value and, above all, which reflect the democracy and transparency which we want in this enlarged Union.
Madam President, when we discussed this last week in the Conference of Presidents, my group - the Liberal Democrats - voted to have a debate today and not to postpone it.
I regret that my remarks today will mostly be about process rather than content, because I think that we still have not found the correct process.
I would, however, like to salute the work the Commission has done this year and to acknowledge the enormous progress in the preparation of the launch of the euro; the very substantial progress on enlargement which we very much welcome; the work which is being done in south-eastern Europe; the break-through on the World Trade Organisation and the very stimulating programme on sustainable development.
All of those and the work on the common area of justice and security are to the credit of the Commission.
I very much agree with the focus of next year's priorities which are sensible and acceptable, particularly in that we need to work closely together on promoting the Community method in building the future of Europe.
There are, however, questions in the legislative programme to which we need answers.
Why last year was only 45% of the programme processed by this time of the year and 55% not?
How is it that 117 or 118 new items not foreseen were added?
I do not mind flexibility - that is good in politics - but this seems rather more chaotic than one's definition of flexibility.
I fully respect the Commission's right of initiative, but I would urge that the Commission should not simply start in February with a general statement of priorities and then, in November, bring forward a specific work programme.
We need an intensive dialogue between times and some intermediate staging-posts at which to make evaluations.
We believe, Mr President of the Commission, like you, in good governance and this Parliament will commit itself to being a high quality player in terms of the input and impact on co-legislation, but that requires criteria.
We need to discuss with each other - and this is not an attempt to interfere with the right of initiative of the Commission - is the law necessary?
Is it proportionate?
Does it respect subsidiarity? Is it transparent and accountable?
What are the options for implementation?
Can we do some kind of regulatory impact assessment before we go down the line?
The Commission already has a wonderful process of consultation in place with social partners.
Share this process with us as well, not because we want to interfere with your right to make the final call, but because we too are players and we cannot be left to one side or not get documents till the eve of a debate.
Our President has communicated to you a scheme that we would commend.
Our Conference of Presidents backs what she has said.
Our Committee on Constitutional Affairs backs what she has said and if we can do that, next year we will discuss politics more and process less.
We have got to get it right.
We have to do this early to avoid a repetition of this unnecessary mutual incomprehension which helps none of us to bring good governance to the European Union.
Mr President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to share my thoughts on the main topic we are discussing today: the legislative programme and the Commission' s working programme.
Mr President of the Commission, you told us that you wanted full and transparent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.
That is all very well.
You told us: 'To be strong, the European Parliament needs a strong Commission' .
We agree.
But you must understand that we cannot accept being treated as the Commission' s obedient stooge.
We of course unreservedly acknowledge the fact that it is very important that the work programme is clearly comprehensible politically, which is the case here; this does not, however, exempt you from presenting a legislative programme.
And yet, today we have to deal with a work programme that was sent to us at the last moment and a legislative programme of which we had no knowledge before last night.
It is difficult for us to work under such conditions.
The European Parliament is already suffering from having no right of legislative initiative, even in areas where the Commission is failing to act - which is, in my opinion, an institutional anomaly that should be corrected in order to reduce the democratic deficit.
However, Parliament does enjoy the power of active cooperation, which is recognised by the Commission.
I would remind you that, from the start of this Parliamentary term, a framework agreement exists between ourselves and the Commission, an agreement that clearly defines the role of Parliament in the legislative process.
In accordance with this agreement, the legislative programme for 2002 should have been presented to us in October, accompanied by an assessment of the previous programme; in this way we would have been able to make criticisms, remarks and proposals at a politically appropriate time and within reasonable timescales.
I must also underline the extent to which it would be appropriate, on a political level, for political debates on the budget and the legislative programme to mutually support and complement each other.
October or November would be an appropriate time for this to take place.
Today, we are two months late and there is no legislative programme, or rather, we have only just discovered one exists.
Under these conditions, I think that Parliament is de facto deprived of its powers of control and influence, which is not a good thing.
I would also like to remind you of some concrete facts: on 30 November, just a few days ago, less than half of the programme for 2001 had been executed.
In addition to this, half of the initiatives taken were not included in the legislative programme for 2001.
This is astonishing at the very least. It must, of course, be admitted that the unforeseen events that took place, which completely turned the political agenda on its head, justified the tabling of proposals to take account of such upheavals, but a careful reading of the texts shows that, to a great extent, these new proposals have nothing to do with the present situation, or, in any case, could have been tabled at some other time, rather than within the context of the programme for 2001.
In my opinion, this reveals, and I think that most Members in my group would agree, that there is quite a significant degree of disorder within the Commission and a lack of common vision of the guidelines that should direct the common work of our institutions.
The explanations that you give us to justify this, which relate to the Commission' s internal reforms, will not satisfy us forever.
I would point out that these explanations have been given since the start of this legislature.
We cannot accept, Mr President, that the European Parliament be deprived of its powers of control, which are clearly recognised; this situation is not good for either Parliament or for the Commission itself.
At a time when we are talking about good governance, of reconciliation with the European citizen, the most fundamental thing is that commitments made and Parliament' s prerogatives be respected.
Madam President, I too would like to thank the Belgian Presidency, and I hope that we shall all have a really successful summit in Laeken.
Today we are debating the Commission's work programme, and I wish to say that my group supports the general resolution by the various political groups concerning this programme.
Why?
Because there is an interinstitutional agreement between two institutions, and I do not think this House is being unreasonable in expecting the Commission to adhere to the undertakings it has given Parliament.
Mr Prodi, in your White Paper on European Governance there is much talk about how Europe could be better governed.
However, you are not performing one of the most elementary tasks, that is to say the presentation of a legislative programme.
I heard this morning that an e-mail with an attachment arrived last night.
The text that I am familiar with so far is a work programme which as far as I can see is simply full of platitudes.
It includes announcements about comprehensive packages of measures, other measures are to be proposed, specific measures are being prepared, and so it goes on for 20 pages.
But what the Council and Parliament need to know above all, and in good time, is what legislation will actually be presented, and, first and foremost, why.
We need to know what the basis for this legislation is so that we can act in unison here.
I must not forget to point out that the national parliaments, which also have a certain role in this process, and a not inconsiderable one at that, have some problems with the whole process. This is a problem that has to be solved, Mr Prodi.
I also have a few more comments about your communication for the Laeken Summit.
I consider that it contains some extremely interesting ideas that are worth supporting.
It is true to say that limiting ourselves strictly to the four priorities identified in Nice would weaken the credibility of the Convention, in other words the list of issues to be addressed needs to be widened in order to meet the public's expectations and to ensure that the enlarged Union will have a viable future.
However, I also have to say that with this paper too, I kept asking myself why the Commission was showing so little courage and vision in the run-up to such an important summit.
What will the public think if the Commission talks about defending a certain European ideal, as it does in the document, in such an unambitious way?
What ideal are we talking about then?
What is the process of deepening that we are all in favour of to be like, and why should it just relate to democracy, as the document suggests?
I really find it rather mysterious why, with an eye to Laeken and particularly when we are envisaging convening a historic convention, we do not quite simply say, yes, our common goal is to create a truly democratic Europe. Furthermore, Mr Prodi, I expect, in view of all this, that in future the Commission will act far more energetically in its capacity as the motor of European integration.
Madam President, allow me to begin with a prediction: the present Commission will scarcely survive into 2004.
It may be toppled by new scandals involving fraud, because the former cases of fraud have not been cleared up and because the reforms that might have prevented new cases have not been introduced.
The Commission may also be toppled by Parliament through a vote of no confidence.
I believe it is heading for the end of the road if it does not change course now.
Parliament' s committee chairmen have asked for what are known as the screening reports on the negotiations with the applicant countries.
Parliament' s group chairpersons have repeated the request.
Still we have not received them.
MEPs sit every day in committee meetings without the relevant and up-to-date papers from the secret legislative process.
There is solemn talk of Parliament as co-legislator, but the legislative power has, in reality, been taken over by officials and ministers in the Council and the Commission.
We are humiliated the whole time.
People who are humiliated can one day deliver a vote of no confidence to the Commission.
After the ground rules had been agreed, we should have had the Commission' s legislative programme in October.
We have now been given an essay containing general reflections and, yesterday evening, a summary containing little detail. However, we have still not been given a proper catalogue of laws.
The Commission should present its annual programme, stating its proposed legal base for this, so that, in the case of each proposal, we can adopt a position on whether the Commission is respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
That is not only a right we possess.
It is a duty imposed by the Treaty on each individual institution.
All the institutions must ensure that the EU does not adopt rules which the Member States can devise just as well or better.
We are asking for an independent discussion of the annual programme as it relates to the proximity principle, and we agree with the other groups in criticising the way in which the Commission keeps its plans secret.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that upholding the Community method has become a habit for many people and I would go as far as to say a religion for some, with its greater and lesser priests: President Delors, you, President Prodi, and Ferdinando Riccardi, who preaches his daily sermon in Agence Europe.
Yet it is a religion, ladies and gentlemen, which has lost its god, for the Community method that you are all upholding was based on the centrality of the Commission, and the Commission no longer has that pivotal status.
The Commission is no longer at the centre of our European integration, it is no longer - as it was when there were six or nine States - the driving force of European integration.
The 15-State Europe has already brought a number of institutional innovations: Mr CFSP is totally outside the Commission' s control.
Well then, ladies and gentlemen, I would like my friend Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and a great many others to answer this crucial question: do you really think that countries like France and Germany, in particular, not to mention the United Kingdom, of course, will place their confidence in a 25-member Commission, working according to the principle of collegiality, and trust it to take fundamental decisions?
That is impossible.
The Commission as it was conceived, to be the central, driving force of the Community method, is no longer, and unless we change the system of European integration radically, the Commission will be increasingly reduced to playing the role of Council secretariat. It is, therefore, a Commission that needs to make an effort to change.
However, I feel, Chairman Poettering, that we are, so to speak, firing on the relief workers, for the problem is institutional, it is Laeken; we need to make radical changes to the institutional system to restore the Commission' s former power and legitimacy.
Only with the American system - with a separate Executive, with the President of the Commission being directly elected, with a scrutinising Parliament safeguarding our Constitutional framework - can we have a properly functioning Europe, a strong Commission, a strong Parliament and a strong Assembly of Member States; otherwise, our Commission' s role will increasingly be reduced to that of Council secretariat.
Mr President, although I agree with many of the comments that have been made today about the year 2001 having been reasonably successful, there are real grounds for concern about the way in which this debate is taking place today.
Firstly, as a matter of principle, we have the institutional agreement of 1993, which says that the programme should be presented by October, and then our agreement of 2000, under which we are to have a broad debate about the programme before it is implemented.
Neither of these have been fulfilled in this particular case.
Why is this totally insufficient?
Firstly, the programme which is presented to us lacks focus.
It is somewhat difficult to see priorities when you have seven of them and, within the priorities, lots of themes which are generating new ideas.
If you have more than three priorities, as Bob Zoellick, the USTR, said, you lose yourself in detail and you can never focus on what is really important.
Secondly, we have a lack of detail.
I understand that we now have a legislative programme sent by e-mail, but Parliament has not been associated with this and it seems, as other speakers have said, that we had a legislative programme which was not implemented this year.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo is right that we did not want it.
We wanted a political programme and legislative programme and Parliament to be associated with that.
Thirdly, there is a lack of coordination: not just coordination among ourselves but with the national parliaments.
As Mrs Kaufmann said: how is it possible to establish a programme for the European Union if not all the actors who are concerned at political level are associated with it?
This leads me to say that we were better off with President Santer.
We were better off with the last Commission as regards the way in which the programme is presented.
At least we had a programme in its outline and there was a real effort to try to get institutional priorities, and we had a legislative programme with details, which we could see in front of us.
My conclusion today is that the Commission is there to propose.
It has the right of initiative but it is not the European government.
It cannot come to us and say this is what the European Union's programme is going to be and expect us simply to accept everything that is in its documents.
Do you not agree, Mr President, that it would be better for the success of the European Union if we were to go back to presentation of the proposals of the legislative programme in October?
We would then be able to discuss, debate, consult on and conclude a programme which the Union could put forward for the year ahead.
If you have all of us with you, you will be better off than if we have interinstitutional wars, which you seem to have started this morning.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we are faced with two dilemmas here.
The first dilemma we face is that as President of the Commission you have quite rightly, and we must be fair about this, presented a political programme.
However, the political programme needs to be underpinned by the legislative programme required to implement the political objectives, and that is what is missing.
Secondly, your programme does not really address the problem that we have, in fact, implemented very little of the 2001 programme.
You did at one point suggest that Parliament and the Council were to blame, but I believe that the Commission is really responsible for this.
Thirdly, this House has, particularly this year, either rejected or substantially amended various Commission proposals.
How are you going to cope with the framework that this Parliament has set?
Your Vice-President, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, could perhaps help you here, and particularly in the fields of the environment and of transport there are very few proposals and indications as to how "sustainability" is to be made a reality.
We all know that there is a whole raft of problems with implementation.
In your paper you do indeed refer to implementation problems.
But the Commission, too, has implementation problems.
From the time when the Commission takes decisions and makes financial commitments to the time when monies are actually paid out, it is not uncommon for not just months but whole years to go by.
That is why it is also important for the Commission to consider how it can improve its own implementation, and, of course, also how national governments can improve implementation of their legislative intentions or the legislative intentions of the European Union.
That brings me to the dilemma over the Laeken communication, a dilemma that I have personally and probably share with most of us here.
It is a good paper and its goals are good.
The only problem, Mr President of the Commission, is this: why it is so ambivalent, so tentative, and so vague?
There is one sentence in which the Commission considers that it is opportune to examine the possibility of providing the Union with a constitutional text.
Why do you not come out and say quite plainly that you are in favour of such a text, whether you call it a constitution or a charter or whatever?
This kind of language typifies the way in which the Commission fails to clearly express what it stands for.
I believe that at this particular moment this is especially important, as we are to have a convention.
Except that this convention will chiefly consist of Members of Parliament from the individual Member States.
We are talking here about representatives of our national governments, whereas for the Community method, which is quite rightly a matter of concern, there are Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Commission.
If the Council - and I am addressing this comment to you, Madam President-in-Office - on top of all that decides to appoint a former prime minister, or as now seems likely, a former president, as president of the convention, rather than a former President of the Commission, then I fear that the convention will from the outset be stigmatised to some extent by the fact that the majority of its members will not be guided by the Community method, and that the majority will perhaps not be particularly interested in strengthening the Commission and the European Parliament.
Mr Prodi, I believe that at such a stage and in the present situation, the Commission document that you adopted at the end of December should have used clearer language.
You partly admitted that in your speech to us today.
It is not a question of saying we could, we ought to or we should - it is question of the Commission saying that it believes we must strengthen the Community dimension, and of the Commission saying that it believes Parliament should be strengthened as the central legislative institution of the European Union.
To that extent we are faced with a dilemma about saying that you are right.
It would be unfair to reject what you have said today.
But the dilemma we face is that in such a sensitive political situation we need a Commission and a Commission President who are willing to say in even stronger, clearer and more unambiguous terms what needs doing - namely that the European Union as a whole needs to be strengthened, and that the Community method will take Europe into the future.
Mr President, my fellow MEPs have presented a great deal of justified criticism concerning the procedures in relation to today' s programme.
Allow me, however, to welcome the fact that a kind of evaluation from the year gone by is included and that there is more strategic thinking when it comes to the Commission' s intended way of working.
Now let us talk about the future, however.
President Prodi outlined, of course, how it will be possible in future to deal with the issue of the annual programme.
As Parliament' s rapporteur, I have had the opportunity to monitor this matter for quite a long time.
I hope we can conclude it soon and begin work on the programme for 2003.
As the co-decision procedure has developed, Parliament and the Council, too, must also play a larger role in devising the annual programme.
That does not mean that the Commission' s right of initiative is being questioned, but that all three institutions should be more in step in encouraging both openness and efficiency in our joint work.
Moreover, it would then be easier for national parliaments and citizens to follow the process.
Where the timetable is concerned, it looks as if we can now perhaps agree.
There is an introductory presentation of the general priorities, followed by thorough discussions between the Commission and the committees concerned with a view to establishing the details.
It is important for the parliamentary committees to be involved at an early stage because it is the committees which will then deal with the proposal.
We can then present the definitive proposal by no later than the beginning of November.
When it comes to the content of the programme, last year' s criticism does not mean that we do not want any legislative proposals.
On the contrary, our common framework agreement states that what we are concerned with here is the annual legislative programme.
Parliament has demanded clear proposals in order of precedence, explanatory statements with timetables, budget references, legal bases and information about who is responsible.
Follow-up and evaluation must also be improved.
As we have seen, a very great many proposals are being re-introduced, at the same time as other proposals are disappearing.
It should be possible to set up a joint database to monitor the decision-making process for each topic.
A process which is clear, open and predictable should benefit all the institutions and also the citizens we are here to serve.
It is our joint responsibility to ensure that this happens.
Mr President, the Commission' s communication to the Laeken European Council, with regard to the organisation of the debate prior to the IGC, seems to us to be mistaken in both its objective and method.
With regard to the objective, it states that we must, and I quote, 'draw up credible guidelines in order that an enlarged Europe can achieve political, economic and social integration' .
And yet, if the different peoples of Europe really do want common cooperation and work at a European level, none of them has, to my knowledge, ever asked for this extreme type of integration, that is to say political, economic and social unification, by means of a democratic consultation.
The objective today is not to strengthen this 'integration-unification' , headed by supranational institutions, which we do not want, but to better organise and make more effective the nations' control over Brussels.
Under these conditions, the Community method, useful on occasions, should not become the rule, for it is too supranational, too rigid, and removes the Union from the reality of its citizens.
It should be provided with procedures which are more flexible, founded on respect for national democracies.
This is why the forthcoming Convention should mainly rely upon national parliaments, which should work within networks.
And to start with, it is these national parliaments which should have the task of organising the debate with their citizens and to put forward proposals without having to pass through an artificial forum of associations, which are European in name but not at all representative.
Mr President, in my opinion, the priorities of the Commission' s working programme for 2002 must focus on the European Union' s immediate challenges, both in the internal field (the internal market and Economic and Monetary Union), and in the external field - especially following the attacks of 11 September - including, of course, the fight against terrorism.
These challenges are very clear - how to revitalise our economies just a few weeks before the introduction of the single currency, how to take advantage of the challenges and opportunities offered by accession, with 13 countries seeking entry to the Union and, at the same time, how to reinvent Europe in a situation and at a moment when we are about to begin the work of a convention aimed at preparing a new Intergovernmental Conference, the objective of which must be to prevent the 'Old Continent' becoming an outdated continent.
This Commission' s working programme for 2002 is accompanied by a communication on the Community method.
I believe that that is an absolutely fundamental issue and we would be making a grave error if were to devote ourselves entirely to incidental issues and allow what is really crucial at the moment to stagnate.
Next year there will be elections in several countries of the European Union and we need an institution which not only cares for the coming generations, but which takes account of their concerns and challenges.
And that institution must be the European Commission, Mr President.
This is not the time to analyse the decimal points presented to us by financial analysts.
This is a time for considering the broader picture and I believe, Mr President, that it would be a serious mistake for this Parliament to exaggerate the errors which may be made by the European Commission.
I want to say this, Mr President, because it is in the interest of Parliament and the Community as a whole to have a strong Commission.
It therefore seems to me that, before preaching about how to sort out the world' s problems, we should take a good look at our own institution and respect the work and decisions taken in the field of our parliamentary bodies.
I say this in relation to something Mr BarÃ³n mentioned - I regret that he is not present at the moment - and frankly I do not believe that we should take advantage of this debate to introduce extemporaneous issues which are not currently amongst our concerns or relevant to this debate.
I also believe, Mr President, that it would be a serious mistake for the Commission not to direct all its efforts towards restoring that alliance, that harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission, which has led to all the progress made within the Community.
Mr President, I hope that, by means of this working programme, the disagreements of the past may be transformed into the agreements of the present and I hope that that method will prevail in the work between the Commission and Parliament.
Anything else would be to confuse what is incidental with what is fundamental.
We should mobilise all our forces in order to consolidate, as I have said, this strategic alliance.
President Prodi stated that he was attached to interinstitutional cooperation and full transparency.
I, of course, welcome such a statement: it is essential for this process to work.
But you have to start by respecting the procedures that are agreed already, that are known and that are laid down in writing.
I have here the Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission agreed just two years ago.
I also have Rule 57 of our Rules of Procedure which lays down how we deal with the annual legislative programme and reflects the agreements that have been entered into in the past with the Commission.
That rule states that the Commission shall present its Annual Legislative Programme in October.
Of course, we know that there can be delays, that has happened before.
But it specifies that this Annual Legislative Programme must refer to all proposals of a legislative nature and every act included in the programme must indicate the legal basis and the timetable envisaged for its adoption.
On these points, what we have had before us this week fails to respect our Rules of Procedure and existing agreements reached between the two institutions.
The one positive innovation is that Rule 57(6) has for the first time been implemented with the statement made by the President-in-Office which I like others welcome.
In fact we have a work programme, a work programme - not a legislative programme - outlining priorities.
To outline priorities is fine and the priorities chosen are good ones - perhaps obvious ones, but nevertheless the right ones.
But we need the detail, we need the detail that is required in our Rules of Procedure and in the Framework Agreement.
We need it for our committees to be able to get to work and plan their work and appoint rapporteurs who can work with the Commission in the pre-legislative phase.
It is in the Commission's interest as well as in our own interest.
I understand that we are now receiving the detail by e-mail, but even that, as far as I can see, fails to mention the legal basis and the timetable of each proposal.
General debates are all very well on broad priorities, but we have that several times a year when the Commission presents its programme, when each Presidency presents its programme, and we tend to have that sort of debate surrounding each European Council meeting as well.
What we are supposed to get there is the nitty-gritty detail as well.
President Prodi is right to say that the procedure needs improving, but we have a procedure to negotiate such improvements, the MalmstrÃ¶m report in our committee for example.
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m is already in dialogue with the Commission on that and, frankly, we should have waited for the outcome of that before changing procedure.
The President of the Commission cannot unilaterally take existing agreements and tear them up.
New procedures must be agreed by both institutions.
Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, this has, I feel, been a useful debate which has served to make things clearer.
A number of extremely clear messages have emerged which the Commission will take into account, for we have the same objectives and there is a harmonious alliance between Parliament and the Commission.
There may have been times when our instruments were slightly out of tune, but we have worked extremely well together.
I have several things to say on this point.
I assure you that the Commission has been concentrating explicitly on cooperation with Parliament, and I feel, moreover, that a Commission President has never been present at so many plenary sessions or attended all the committee meetings and meetings of committee chairmen to which he is invited.
Each Commissioner stands before the relevant Parliamentary committee on average seven times a year to discuss political issues relating to his or her responsibilities, to his or her portfolio; 80% of subjects are dealt with in plenary by the committee responsible; a record-breaking number of confidential documents has been sent to Parliament; each year, to date, we answer over 3 000 questions from Members of Parliament and dealt with 200 petitions referred to us by the Ombudsman.
We are therefore genuinely making an enormous effort to respect our commitment to maintaining a responsible relationship with Parliament.
Of course, there are problems and areas that need improvement, and it is precisely in order to remedy these that we have reformed our way of working.
Today, I hear people saying, and I know what they mean, that we need more than the political programme; establishing the political programme was a step forwards but it is not enough, for it must go hand in hand with the legislative programme.
We are finding it difficult to achieve this, and when we realised that this is what is required, we immediately took steps to establish the legislative programme, albeit with a slight delay.
However, we are aware that the driving force of our relationship with Parliament is the political programme, for it is on the political programme that we must work together.
People are saying we must not start in February and conclude in November and then let the relationship fall by the wayside.
I fully agree with this sentiment.
What I would ask, however, is that we be informed of dates for meetings with the committee chairmen a long time in advance; indeed, I assure you that on the few occasions when we were unable to meet, it was because we already had absolutely unbreakable commitments.
However, if we establish the schedule together, I am sure we will be able to achieve our aims.
Moving on from the subject of cooperation, I would now like to focus very briefly on the issue of the role of the Commission and of the forthcoming Convention, starting with something which may not appear to be a key point but which I consider to be extremely important, namely that we need to work alongside the Council as regards the Convention' s secretariat.
It will be an extremely important time.
Of course, the Convention will not take any decisions itself, but it is such an innovative way of working and the fact that it is going to work transparently before our entire continent, before the entire people of Europe, is so significant that it will ultimately acquire huge importance.
I would like to make a further point in this regard as well, the view has been put forward on a number of different occasions that the Commission should be stronger.
I, too, am of this opinion, but I would like to look at what we have achieved, although our achievements are sometimes understated and difficult to understand, so to speak.
In my opinion, it is the results that count.
The Convention did not just appear out of nowhere, it was not presented to us on a plate; the Convention was a working relationship between Parliament and the Commission immediately after Nice, at a time when both institutions were in the deepest despair.
It is precisely this work, carried out together, which enabled us to rise again towards the goal which we had lost all hope of achieving.
We must acknowledge the substantial help we received from the Belgian Presidency, which really took the project to heart, but it was the Parliament-Commission cooperation which won for us the chance - and I would stress, this is a chance which has never before been available in European history - to reform the institutions by means of a broad, open debate with no time pressure, so that all the European citizens can listen to us and understand what we are talking about.
When the European citizens realise that this debate is the debate on the efficient running of the institutions, on unanimous voting or the different vetoes, the debate on the need to proceed with all speed in the interests of serving Europe itself, well, then the significance of this debate will be understood and, indeed, become crystal clear.
Our problem was that the decisions were being taken in fora and by bodies whose significance was not understood.
Well then, this is the strength of the Commission and the strength of Parliament - patience, and also never losing sight of our primary objectives.
To Mr Swoboda, whose comments were extremely constructive, I would point out that, in terms of the debate we conducted on the basic text, our proposal dates from January 2001 - that is when we made every effort to ensure that the text could, slowly but surely, become the focal point of all our work.
2001 has been a year in which we have redefined the boundaries of our work and outlined the strategy.
Certainly, there is a great deal at stake, for our whole future, our entire future, hangs upon the Convention, but we have, at last, taken this debate to the appropriate forum where the citizens will be able to listen to us.
Finally, on a lighter note, with regard to institutional reform, I would like to inform Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and the other four group chairmen that I replied to their letters on 5 December and that my response bears the reference number 850511.
I therefore feel we need to reform the postal services, although whether those responsible for collecting the mail or those responsible for delivering it, I am not sure.
In any case, for my part, I duly replied to the letter, as is my custom.
The debate is closed.
WTO meeting in Qatar
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the WTO meeting in Qatar.
Honourable Members of Parliament, as you know, the fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation took place at Doha in Qatar one month ago.
This meeting can be considered a success for the world community, and certainly for the European Union.
It was not an easy task, for the European Union left for Doha with an ambitious, broad agenda.
Some of you witnessed the progress of the negotiations in situ.
As President-in-Office of the Council, I exchanged ideas on several occasions with MEPs who moreover - and that was very practical -had their meeting room immediately adjoining that of the presidency.
I assume that everyone who was there undoubtedly sensed the great scepticism displayed initially by many WTO members with regard to the EU' s broad agenda.
On 19 November, the General Affairs Council has been congratulated on the results obtained at Doha, and on the excellent work carried out by our negotiators, Commissioners Pascal Lamy and Franz Fischler, and their colleagues.
It is thanks to this work, as well as the cohesion and solidarity shown by the Union through these negotiators, that they were able, in spite of the fact that the situation of the European Union within the WTO was not favourable at the start of the process, to get things back on an even keel and obtain much better results than we might have hoped for.
The Union, which at all times remained a major player in the conference, was finally able to achieve the main objective it had set itself, of launching a new round of multilateral trade negotiations focusing on trade liberalisation, the strengthening of regulations and the acknowledgement of development needs.
In fact, the development dimension is the main thread of what we now call the 'Doha development agenda' .
This is the name, in fact, that has been given to all of the texts adopted.
The work programme adopted in view of the multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of the ministerial declaration includes a package of important implementation measures and takes up those unresolved implementation issues that aim more or less for a re-balancing or an amendment of existing agreements within the context of the negotiation agenda relating to single undertakings.
In addition to this, all chapters in the agenda are focused on specific measures to assist developing countries, with regard, for example, to the access of their products to markets, to their special or differential treatment, technical assistance or capacity building.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this fifth ministerial conference for the development dimension.
It should take place before the end of 2003 and will be a key point in the negotiations.
We will need, in fact, to make decisions with regard to further negotiations, notably with regard to investments and competition, issues that will have been studied during the first phase.
It is obvious that this will be, for developing countries as well as for others, a very important time for assessment.
Furthermore, the Union should be particularly pleased with the approval of the derogation with regard to the partnership agreement between the European Community and the ACP countries.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioners, the European Union has made a considerable effort in the field of access to medicines.
It has managed to bring initially very diverse opinions closer together and has contributed greatly to the final text which was met by approval by all parties.
Indeed, the statement about TRIPS and public health has given the developing countries the desired assurance that the TRIPS Agreement is indeed offering flexibility, even without amending that Agreement.
Even NGOs have received the Agreement favourably.
As for further legislation, an important step has been made in order to develop the environmental dimension of world trade.
The European Union managed to ensure that negotiations on the environment start without delay, and that the link between the WTO rules and the trade rules of the multi-lateral environment agreements which form part of them becomes more transparent.
This is a very important breakthrough.
Furthermore, the negotiation agenda offers scope for expanding the environmental themes during the Fifth Ministerial Conference.
However, as is always the case in negotiations, not everything went according to plan, of course.
For example, it appeared impossible, despite efforts, to alter the developing countries' resistance to the introduction of basic labour standards in the trade negotiations.
It appeared impossible to make a reference in the ministerial statement to the development of a permanent forum between the ILO and other international organisations, including the WTO.
However, the European Union did manage to have the phrase scrapped which would have restricted the dialogue about basic labour standards to the ILO, and that enables us to continue our quest for a permanent forum.
Moreover, at the suggestion of the presidency, a statement was added in the shape of this phrase to the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 14 November in Doha, Qatar, in which the Council and the Commission confirm this objective.
The principle of future negotiations was also laid down for the so-called Singapore themes which form part of the priorities of European industry and which concern investments, competition, trade facilitation and transparency regarding government contracts.
These will be initiated following the Fifth Ministerial Conference on the basis of explicit consensus with regard to its modalities.
There is also reason for satisfaction in the field of agriculture.
The negotiations will aim to further improve market access and dismantle the different types of trade-distorting aid.
In addition to the pure trade aspects, serious consideration will also be given to non-trade concerns.
Some of you have followed the export subsidies saga from very close range.
You know the outcome, but let me assure you that it was nevertheless a difficult journey, and that for a long time it looked like the Commissioners would not succeed in reaching a sound agreement.
But they did anyway, and they deserve all our congratulations on that score.
(FR) Finally, a last word on transparency.
The organisation of internal works at Doha was exemplary.
The alternation between plenary sessions, on the one hand, and issue groups, on the other, ensured the necessary combination of transparency and efficiency.
During the plenary sessions, the delegations had the opportunity to express their opinions and to listen to the positions of others, as well as listening to the assessments, I quote, of the President' s friends.
These individuals chaired the issue groups, whose objective was to facilitate bilateral and multilateral discussions between WTO members, to harmonise positions and to draw up written agreements.
It should be noted that none of the President' s friends were citizens of the European Union or the United States, and that these two regions were not represented at the time further balances in the text were drawn up.
I am underlining this because, all too often, there is the tendency to believe that everything that happens at the WTO is a result of constant collusion between the United States and the European Union, and that other countries do not have a say, so this is proof that this is not the case.
Therefore, our respective representatives read the texts at the same time as all the other delegations.
Several delegations from developing countries showed their appreciation and satisfaction with the working method used during their closing speeches.
