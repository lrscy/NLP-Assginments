The Europe we have is not an accident of history, it has not appeared by chance, nor is it written in the stars, and it requires a great effort to make it a reality.
It is necessary, but in order to make it a reality, the efforts of many people, of you, Mr President, and of all of us, is required.
It is the result of a slow development during which we have âmade the path by walkingâ, which involves commitment, enthusiasm and sometimes disillusionment.
President Ciampi has come to the European Parliament today at a time when we are experiencing a degree of disenchantment.
He will help us to understand why, because he is well aware that Europe was a dream based on peace and cooperation.
That dream is a reality today and, for that very reason, it no longer inspires dreams, it has lost its capacity to make people dream.
We need to find new elements, new ideals shared by everybody, different to those of a few decades ago, in order to ensure that Europe once again inspires enthusiasm, that it makes people dream, that it makes them want to turn the need into a reality.
I believe that Mr Ciampiâs presence is extremely appropriate in this debate on the future of Europe and that by being here today, he is symbolising the start of that debate.
That is how I believe we should interpret his presence in the European Parliament, because we perhaps need to create a new young Europe amongst all of us, in the style of Giuseppe Mazzini, and this year, the bicentenary of his birth, we should remember his idea that democracy and freedom unite people regardless of where they live.
Mr President, we are convinced that your visit, your example and your words will be of great assistance to us at the difficult crossroads Europe is facing today, so that we can make further progress on the construction of a Europe that is able to guarantee not just peace and cooperation, but also prosperity and security, and that is able to do in the rest of the world what it has done here: create a society based on respect for diversity, on the integration of differences and the construction of a common identity.
Mr Ciampi, it is an honour for the European Parliament to welcome you and I give you the floor.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your warm welcome and I thank you, in particular, MrÂ President, for the cordial words with which you chose to present me.
It is a deeply felt honour for me to speak in the most elevated surroundings of European democracy, to make the voice of the Republic of Italy heard in the heart of the constitutional system of the Union.
It is with conviction that I use the adjective âconstitutionalâ, because such is the legal system that we have been building together for 50 years, treaty after treaty.
The European Union is not, and cannot be, just an economic free trade zone.
It is above all, and has been since its beginnings, a political structure, a land of rights, a constitutional reality that does not contradict our beloved national Constitutions, but connects them and completes them.
It is a political structure that does not deny the identity of our nation states, but strengthens them in the face of the large-scale challenges of an increasingly broad horizon.
It is a land of rights, to which every other inhabitant of this planet can look with the confidence that here, more than anywhere else, the values of human beings are respected.
The ambitious definition given to the Union by the Constitutional Treaty is a legitimate one, that is to say, âa special area of human hopeâ.
From this position we must all go forward together, whether we be the 11 Member States which, like Italy, have already ratified the Constitutional Treaty, the Member States that are still to do so, or the two Member States that have said no.
A single institutional framework joins us together irreversibly.
It is already strong enough to enable us together to do many things for our citizens, in order to regain the popular consensus on the Treaty that has been lacking in many countries and to strengthen our institutions, which we have inherited from a successful past.
Precisely because we are already a political and constitutional body, we can indeed realistically assess the meaning of the rejection seen in two countries linked from the start to the European project.
As little as a few months ago, on the occasion of the formal signing in Rome of the Constitutional Treaty by the 25 governments of the Union, the single project met with widespread consent.
Within the space of a few months, the fear spread that the citizens were excluded from crucial decisions regarding their future and concerns heightened over the lack of economic growth.
Is it really legitimate, however, to interpret the outcome of the referenda as disaffection with European unity?
Is it legitimate to give in to the temptation of completely challenging the very project of the founding fathers?
If we raise our eyes, the Treaty of Rome of October 2004 rather appears to be the scapegoat of widespread unrest that does not so much relate to institutional order as to the government policies of the Union.
We even note a paradox.
The persistent call for a political revival of the Union, which is more urgent than the also necessary institutional reforms are, bears witness to the awareness of the common destiny on which a Constitution is really based.
That is why we now have to think about the Unionâs policies for the future, without, however, abandoning the constitutional design outlined by the industrious Convention.
What does the future urgently demand of our Europe?
Above all, to borrow from Ortega y Gasset, it demands thatthe backbone of the Union should consist of measures of political cohesion, physical cohesion and social cohesion.
The fundamental principle of subsidiarity has to be interpreted as a principle of political cohesion, allowing bottom-up participation in Community decision-making, starting from the thousands and thousands of town councils in our Union.
The European Union has to exist starting from those levels.
Europe also needs physical cohesion, transport and communication structures, which make Europeans more united while respecting the environment and the countryside.
Lastly, Europe, which invented the welfare state, needs social cohesion.
We cannot allow substantial disparities in living standards to persist among countries and consequently among the peoples to whom our international personality offers united representation.
Europe consequently calls for the historical objective of convergence and cohesion to be achieved by means of appropriate policies for managing the economy.
I have always believed, first as a banker and then as a politician, that the principle of free trade in the economic culture of the Union means being able to speak to the market in the language of the market, but that it cannot mean indulging all of its whims.
It is the lack of political will from national governments that prevents their budget policies from being effectively coordinated.
That makes it difficult for the Union to use a common fund, partly made up of Europeâs borrowing on the international credit market, to finance major infrastructure works of European interest and importantcommon research and innovation initiatives, and to create a legacy of common public assets.
The Lisbon Strategy is the first link in a chain that should lead to the European economy being governable.
The national governments must send out a precise message, made convincing by the allocation of public resources.
The sought-after flexibilities must be utilised by businesses in order to gain in competitiveness and to increase their production base and sales in Europe and worldwide.
Europe has to revive its own commitment to major Community projects.
We have been successful on many occasions, including in recent years, for instance in CERN and the European Space Agency, with the ITER and Galileo projects, which have been a decisive step forward in strengthening Europeâs technological capabilities, and with the Erasmus project, which has opened up new European horizons to over a million young people.
Airbus too is an example of what we can do together if we only unite.
We can also look with confidence at the resourcefulness of the euro zone, which is now presided over by Jean-ClaudeÂ Juncker, to whom I send my best wishes, partly on account of our long friendship and collaboration.
The euro is the greatest demonstration of the united will of the European people, and a driving force of political integration.
It is an encouraging sign of confidence that six of the ten accession countries have already begun to take part in SME 2, thus taking the first important steps towards joining the euro zone.
The tangible benefits of taking part in the single currency are there for all to see: protection from imbalances on the exchange market, low interest rates and strengthened competition in those countries of the euro zone that have adopted virtuous policies.
Â Â  Would the ushers please remove that symbol immediately.
Accompany the Member to the door, expel him from the Chamber!
Expel him from the Chamber immediately!
I said expel him from the Chamber!
Would the ushers please remove any symbol or element that may disrupt order in the Chamber.
Please ensure that no element that may disrupt normal order in the Chamber remains.
If there are any, remove them.
I am sorry, Mr President.
Please continue.
Â Â  . We must record both the strengthening of the euro on the international markets and the policy of price stability pursued by the European Central Bank as extraordinary success stories, but we cannot settle for this situation in the long term.
The confirmed, legitimate rigour of the Stability Pact does not in itself guarantee growth if inertia persists.
It will continue to be difficult to see the positive effects of the euro if there is no coordinated management of either national budgets or the direction taken by the Member Statesâ economic policies.
It is only on these foundations that the Union will be able to entirely achieve its potential, bestowed on it by the single currency, of being a global economic player and of consolidating an economic and monetary bloc capable of promoting the interests of the citizens and the rhythms of its balanced development.
We now also confidently await an agreement on the financial perspectives of the Union.
An open and frank political debate on the priorities for the Unionâs actions is a positive step, but a Community budget needs to be approved as soon as possible that not only reflects a balance among the various requirements of the Member States, but is also based on consistent, inclusive objectives.
I express in this House the earnest hope that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, President-in-Office of the European Union, succeeds in the work he pledged to carry out before this Parliament.
The vitality of the European model will also depend on the ability to mobilise new forces within our countries.
Only by developing a dialogue and constructive coexistence between European citizens and non-European residents, in fact, will we succeed in strengthening the best aspects of our society.
Finally, the future of our Europe calls for policies of security and peace.
The international vision of the European Union, based on the primacy of the law, on trust and on the multilateral system, raises expectations and hopes throughout the world.
Europe, however, will only be able to influence international balances if it is united.
By acting alone, we would be at the mercy of events greater than us, events that threaten peace and European security.
Consistent with that approach, the European Parliament has long raised the issue of the united representation of Europe in the United Nations.
The resolution adopted in June, like the previous resolution of January 2004, stipulates that a single seat for the European Union in the UN Security Council is the objective that Europe must set itself.
This clarity of vision is a credit to the European Parliament.
The awareness of our common roots and the shared memory of the good and bad times of our history bear witness to a higher European interest harmonising national interests, protecting them from the excesses that plagued our past and promoting them within a common vision of our relations with the world.
Enlarged Europe has now touched the boundaries of its cultural and historical identity.
Although geography does not enable Europeâs borders to be identified with certainty, the common area of principles, values and rules conveyed by the European Union is today fully identifiable.
Enlargement of the Union was an historical duty towards peoples who regarded accession to the Union as the guarantee of their regained freedom, the conclusion of nearly half a centuryâs anticipation.
We expect the new Member States, which are entitled to live in a Union that is effective and united in relation to them as well, to provide a constructive and enthusiastic contribution, and we have already seen them do so.
The enlarged Union will proceed as one.
Precisely because it has become enlarged, however, it will require, more so than in the past, progressive measures indicating the path to follow in order to complete the union of Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is the duty of the European Parliament to reintroduce the European Union as a general feeling among people.
It is your responsibility to respond to citizensâ requests for even greater democracy, transparency and governability.
Ever since 14 February 1984, when the European Parliament presented AltieroÂ Spinelliâs draft European Constitution, this House has constantly demanded greater involvement in amending the Treaties.
Now, the most representative of the European institutions has the historical responsibility not to squander the founding heritage and to ensure that the period of reflection on the Constitution does not fall by the wayside.
The very conclusions of the European Council of 16 and 17 June encourage a debate designed to generate interest and invite the European institutions to contribute to it.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a long time ago now, I had the opportunity, as a university student in Italy and Germany, to witness the extent of the stupidity with which the European Member States, by means of the Second World War, began the slaughter of an entire generation.
For that reason, I look with concern on every slowing down, on every crisis in the European integration process.
I hope, however, that you have detected in my words a calm faith in the future.
Halfway through the last century, great and wise men built a structure that cannot be destroyed, but, like lighthouse keepers, we have to take care to warn young people about new dangers.
In the not too distant future I will come to the end of my term of office as President of the Italian Republic.
Six years ago, after being sworn in, I concluded my address to the Italian Parliament with a declaration saluting and affirming my commitment towards Italy and the European Union, to which I believe I have remained loyal in these recent years brimming with history and changes.
It is a commitment that I am pleased to reaffirm before you now.
Long live Europe, long live the European Union!
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words of thanks to Mr Ciampi.
I do not want to forget to do so as I have on other occasions as a result of the emotions of the moment.
Having listened to you, Mr Ciampi, I believe I can say, on behalf of the great majority of Members of this Parliament, that this institution will remember your words.
You have shown that you belong to the young Europe.
Yes, the young Europe.
Because, as Picasso said, âit takes a long time to become youngâ.
And you have shown that it is possible to become young at a time when youth is precisely what is needed most.
I am sorry about the incident, which in no way represents the majority of this House, quite the contrary, and I pray that the ideas that you have expressed here will help us in the debate we must pursue.
You have said it very clearly.
Allow me to thank you once again.
Europe is a success story, but it could die from its success.
In order to prevent this, we must not allow the most valuable and sensitive elements of our co-existence to become trivialised.
We must not allow everyday reality to make us forget the value of what we have achieved.
We must not allow something wonderful to be treated as something commonplace.
We therefore thank you once again, Mr Ciampi, for being here with us and we hope that your words will be heard outside this Chamber.
Â Â  â Madam President, I am basing my point of order on Articles 166, 75 and 83 of the Regulation and on Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union, as Articles 75 and 83 of the Regulation refer us to the wording of the treaties.
I shall be very brief.
Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that amendments to that treaty will enter into force after ratification by all Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.
Since Article 48 refers to all Member States, it is clear that the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by two of them â France and the Netherlands â and by many more if the people had been consulted, has reduced the Constitutional Treaty to nothing and, therefore, I am afraid â and with all respect due to President Ciampi as a person and to his office â has done the same for President Ciampiâs speech.
Â Â  . The members of the Peopleâs Party for Freedom and Democracy within the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have abstained from voting on the directive on the control of potato cyst nematodes, because they consider this directive to be disproportionate to the seriousness of the issue and as also failing to adhere to the principle of subsidiarity.
The implementation of this directive will lead to high costs, resulting from the directiveâs requirement that many samples be taken.
The directive will also entail high administrative costs in connection with the data registers that have to be set up.
We would add that these costs will in all likelihood be divided between the Member Statesâ governments and the respective sectors in different ways, and this will lead to distortion of competition.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report because I feel that the agreement before us will make a significant contribution towards protecting migratory waterbirds.
It will therefore address both the environmental concerns specifically on the birds in question as well as the broader issue of environmental conservation.
The latter is an issue that should be very close to our hearts, in terms of the benefits that individual Member States can derive from their environment and, politically, in terms of the legacy of protection that we will pass on to future generations.
Â Â  . I voted for this report.
The proposal for a Council decision concerns the conclusion by the European Community of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Water-birds signed by the Community on 1 September 1997, in force since 1 November 1999.
It is one of Conservative of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.
It protects 235 species of birds which are ecologically dependent on wetlands in particular in Africa and Eurasia.
It requires coordinated measures for achieving and maintaining a favourable conservation status for migratory water-bird species using African-Eurasian flyways.
Â Â  . The presence of softeners in plastic toys has, over the past seven years, been the subject of intense and emotional debates in both Parliament and the Council.
I regret the fact that the debate was dominated by emotions rather than reason.
This is something by which I was particularly perturbed during the debates at first and second reading.
The common position is not entirely based on scientific fact.
The subsequent tightening-up of the common position that Parliament has adopted today, and which has already been adopted by the Council, is even further removed from what can be deemed acceptable on scientific grounds.
It is for that reason that I cannot endorse this added stringency.
However, I am also realistic enough to recognise that voting against it now will make no difference, and have therefore abstained from the vote on compromise amendments.
For more details, I would refer to my contribution to the debate of 5 July 2000.
The arguments I deployed then are still as relevant as ever.
Â Â  . A compromise agreement has been reached between the Confederal Group of the European United Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, in order to adopt the report by Mr Trakatellis on the use of certain dangerous substances, namely chemical elements added to PVC to make plastic smoother.
Accordingly, we shall be able to conclude the process at second reading.
We welcome the adoption of this report because it will lead to a permanent ban on the use of six chemicals in items for children, in the light of scientific studies showing that in some cases they can be carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic.
This is a welcome decision and a positive contribution towards protecting children in particular and public health as a whole.
Â Â  â By voting for the gradual elimination of phthalates from toys, Parliament has finally stood firm against the intense lobbying by the manufacturers of toys and articles for children, upholding the principle of prudence and protecting human health.
Toys made of soft PVC are all the more dangerous as children are inclined to put any object within reach into their mouths. Banning phthalates was therefore vital for public health.
Today's vote is a success in those terms.
However, this decision should be the forerunner of other decisions, because toxic substances contained in soft PVC are not only present in toys but also in other everyday objects.
Parliament and the Council have rightly called for a study of other products made of soft PVC.
If the industries really want to be as responsible as they claim, they must stop using soft PVC not only in toys but also in other products (medical equipment, floor coverings and food packaging).
Alternatives have existed for many years, and there is nothing to prevent our turning to healthy products of natural origin.
Â Â  .
I voted for this report to back legislation aimed at enhancing the protection of children's health and the building of consumer confidence through establishing a stringent regulatory framework to govern the manufacture and marketing of toys and childcare articles containing certain phthalates in order to reduce, as far as possible, children's exposure to substances which demonstrably give rise to or could potentially cause a health risk.
I welcome the compromise reached in Committee to ban 6 phthalates in toys for children regardless of their age.
Â Â  . This report has been a long time in coming.
I fully support the restriction on the marketing of phthalates in childrenâs toys.
Childrenâs health must come first.
Â Â  The following are three key aspects of energy security that were not duly taken into account in the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council.
Firstly, greater use must be made of renewable energy sources.
Secondly, balanced use must be made of different kinds of primary fuel.
Thirdly, supplies from different production centres, such as oil and gas fields, must be diversified for each kind of primary fuel.
I believe that it would have a very detrimental impact if EU policy in this area were to be continued, as this policy results in the complete dependence of Poland on one supply source, namely Russian oil and gas, in the name of security.
The second leg of the Yamal pipeline, which is currently at an advanced stage of planning, must definitely be continued.
All other projects, however, such as the pipeline under the Baltic or the âAmber Pipelineâ, must immediately be suspended, as they represent a direct threat to the newly revived Ukrainian democracy.
Energy security for the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy must not be achieved at the cost of Polish dependency on Russian oil and gas, and it must not pose a threat to the economic stability of Ukraine.
Â Â  . The title of the proposal for a directive, and in turn of this report, conceals what it will really entail: namely the creation and functioning of a single market for electricity in the EU.
Although the report states that its objective is to set up a framework in which the Member States will set out general, transparent and non-discriminatory policies on security of the electricity supply, this objective is in fact lower down the reportâs list of priorities than the need for compatibility with the requirements of a competitive single market for electricity.
The Commissionâs proposal uses price rises as the main mechanism for driving down the demand for electricity, and as such the argument that the single market would bring lower prices goes out of the window.
If you have any lingering doubts, simply take a look at the United Kingdom.
The proposal also recommends that the Member States and the regulatory bodies intervene to support initial investment and the return on that investment, but restricts their ability to take action in other areas.
I now turn to the report, which in some areas is a backward step from the Commissionâs proposal.
For example, it fails to provide specific measures for the regulatory body to take in the event of non-compliance on the part of the transport network when carrying out projects.
Hence our vote.
Â Â  . "The draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment regulates many areas of common European energy market.
I indicate three major aspects of the energy security which are not adequately underlined:
Â· enhanced use of renewable energy sources
Â· balanced use of various types of primary fuels
Â· diversification of supplies from various production centres (oil and gas fields) within one type of the primary fuel.
I consider it totally unacceptable to maintain the European policy in this respect leading, in the name of security, to complete dependency of Poland on one source of supply, namely Russian gas and oil.
The well advanced in concept project of the second route of the Jamal Gas pipeline should be continued immediately.
All the other projects (Baltic Sea bottom pipeline or so called "Amber Pipeline") should be abandoned as striking directly in newly emerging Ukrainian democracy.
Energy security of Great Britain, Germany and Italy should not be achieved at the cost if Polish dependency and a threat to Ukrainian economic stability."
Â Â  . I voted for this report which proposes on the whole sensible and worthwhile amendments to the Commission proposal.
The main provisions of the proposal are aimed at establishing measures ensuring the proper functioning of the EU internal market for electricity by safeguarding security of electricity supply and by ensuring an adequate level of interconnection between Member States.
It also aims to establish a framework within which Member States shall define general, transport and non-discriminatory policies on security of electricity supply compatible with the requirements of a competitive single market for electricity.
All these objectives merit support.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr Chichester, because I feel that the objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity in the Union and safeguarding the security of electricity supply is a vital one.
The establishment of a framework setting out a transparent, non-discriminatory policy that is compatible with the requirements of a single market for electricity is crucial to the issue of security of supply.
We should therefore support the measures taken to improve energy policies, given their vital importance to the quality of our lives, both now and for future generations.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to defend Membersâ freedom of debate from attempts to prevent them from speaking out on political action, irrespective of the party or the movement that they represent.
That is why I voted in favour of immunity.
In this particular case, MrÂ Bossi was prosecuted for having maintained that Mr Comencini was guilty of betrayal and political unreliability, firstly with regard to the (MSI) and secondly with regard to the It is a historically established fact.
If I declare today that the ministers of the Italian Republic, GianfrancoÂ Fini, AltieroÂ Matteoli, GianniÂ Alemanno and MarioÂ Landolfi have betrayed the political project and statute of the and have destroyed the alternative to the liberal and communist regime by changing the statutes and the aims of that party and transforming it into a different entity, can I be investigated and prosecuted for such an act or am I exercising my right to political debate?
If I commit a crime by declaring their betrayal, I am denounced ...
Â Â  . I am delighted with the rejection of this report, and with our contribution to that rejection.
The report turns a blind eye to existing problems in the EU â namely recession, sluggish domestic demand and slow economic growth, accompanied by high levels of unemployment, poverty and income inequalities â which have been exacerbated by the introduction of economic and monetary union and the introduction of the euro.
The solution cannot be more of the same acceleration of the so-called structural reforms, namely, making the labour market more flexible, the policy of liberalisations and the privatisation of social security.
All of which is done in the name of the holy grail of price stability, or rather, wage moderation.
This objective is already a reality, with salaries being reduced in real terms and productivity gains being passed on to employers.
We welcome the rejection of the narrow view of the Stability and Growth Pact contained in this report, which ignores the reform of the Pact and thus displays the kind of blinkered attitude that has class stamped all over it.
The report also goes as far as to criticise current working time in the EU, comparing it with other regions in the world and making a direct call for it to be increased.
Â Â  . I regret having to vote against this report because the author chose to focus primarily on the breach and reform of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is contrary to an agreement that this report should not duplicate the work of other reports but should concentrate solely on the competences and performances of the ECB.
Â Â  . Given that the prime objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) is maintaining price stability, it is fair to say that, whilst conditions in the European and world economy have hardly been favourable, the ECB has achieved its key objectives.
In this respect, I endorse the report before us.
It must also be acknowledged that the ECB prepared for last Mayâs enlargement most efficiently.
I wish to point out, however, that this does not mean that I give total, unreserved support for the ECBâs policies; for example, I feel that the ECB has reacted in timely fashion to the developing economic situation and has managed to adapt in areas such as interest rates.
Â Â  Madam President, the euro was originally intended to enable the public to identify more with the EU and to usher in a new era of economic growth, but far from that being the case, it still does not enjoy full acceptance and, by cranking up frustration with the European Union, has had precisely the opposite effect.
What prompted this downturn was, initially, the fobbing off of public criticism and rejection with the promise of a hard currency and the introduction of the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, the economically and legally dubious means whereby one was meant to be created.
To date, only Luxembourg and Switzerland have been able to do anything like meet its convergence criteria.
In order, nonetheless, to be able to participate in the common currency, countries sold off their gold reserves and state property on a large scale, going through the motions of privatisation, divesting and indulging in a great deal of cosmetic budgeting.
The result of all this was massive price rises in most countries that had adopted the euro.
If the new Member States are not also to be sucked into this downward spiral, each country should take the decision by allowing its people to vote on it, having first been supplied with frank, honest and objective information.
Â Â  We are well disposed towards the European Parliamentâs resolution on an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
At the same time, we voted against the European Parliamentâs call to shift Swedish opinion in favour of Swedish participation in EMU and of a transition to the euro.
We believe that the result of the Swedish referendum should be respected.
Swedish participation in EMU and the eurozone will not be a live issue for the foreseeable future.
Â Â  I have today chosen for two main reasons to vote against the own-initiative report on an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union.
Firstly, I believe that it is up to each Member State to decide how it wishes to conduct the debate on the euro.
It must not be taken charge of by the Commission.
Secondly, experience of centralised European campaigns is generally bad.
They involve a waste of resources, something that should not be encouraged.
Discussions of monetary policy and currency should instead take place through a dialogue between citizens and decision-makers.
I have therefore voted today against this report.
Â Â  . The British Conservative delegation normally abstains on matters concerning the Euro.
We have no desire to be part of the single currency but neither do we have any wish to for the project to fail, as we hope to see a strong European economy with a stable currency that provides a good trading environment for British industry.
Therefore we are usually content to leave the operation of EMU to those who are most concerned.
Nevertheless, we cannot accept this report.
The problems that the Euro faces have not arisen because of a failure of communication, and where the Euro is unpopular it is not because the public has been inadequately informed.
The Euro will only revive in the minds of the public when the necessary economic and structural reforms promoted by the Lisbon strategy have been undertaken, and when the Stability and Growth Pact works in an effective way.
As the report notes, at least â¬280 million has already been spent by European institutions on this, apart from that which has been spent by national governments.
Institutional expenditure of this kind is not acceptable.
Â Â  . With its information and communication strategy with regard to the euro and economic and monetary union, the EU has one objective, which is to âsellâ the euro, in other words to invest more money in the European propaganda machine in the form of the PRINCE âinformationâ campaigns, aimed at convincing the citizens of what are seen as the benefits of the euro.
Consequently, we reject this report unequivocally, because it is based on the principle that the euro has been positive and beneficial.
It even considers that this has been the most successful of the European projects.
What is more, it stresses that the popularity of the euro is crucial to the future ratification of the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ.
This suggests that the European institutions are unaware of the growing opposition to the euro among the citizens.
They base their views on the idea that, if the people are opposed to it, then that is because they are ill-informed or, better still, because they are out of touch with reality.
Such is the arrogance and the blinkeredness of those who claim to represent the citizens.
They disregard the fact that the economic and employment situation is worsening, and overlook macro-economic issues, as though a single monetary policy could address the different needs of 25 economies.
They also act as though the objective of this policy were neutral, when in fact the primary aim is to reduce salaries in real terms.
We must take stock of the costs of the euro, which is hampering sustainable development.
Â Â  â MrÂ Maatenâs report is, to say the least, surprising.
It appears to be an attempt to assess the successes and failures of the euro only slightly more than six years after its introduction.
According to the report, the euro and its accompanying Stability and Growth Pact have been a complete success.
The only failure has been communication: as usual, it is the Europeans who have missed the point!
The solution being proposed is a vast information campaign, or rather an exercise in brainwashing on a continental scale.
A Potemkin policy!
Did the euro cause a substantial rise in the cost of consumer staples and therefore a severe loss of consumer purchasing power?
Or was it an optical illusion?
The policy of austerity required by adoption of the euro has reduced economic growth by one percentage point each year and cost thousands of jobs, making the eurozone the worldâs least dynamic economic region.
Nonsense!
The euro is synonymous with growth and prosperity.
Anything wrong is the fault of the Member States concerned.
The Eurocrats of Brussels are, on the other hand, infallible.
It was precisely that type of attitude, a mixture of lies and contempt for the people, which led to the rejection of this Europe of the technocrats.
Â Â  I cannot support the European Parliamentâs resolution on an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
I believe that it is up to each Member State to decide whether it wishes to have an information and communication strategy or campaigns for the euro and Economic and Monetary Union.
Moreover, I believe that the result of the Swedish referendum in 2003, when the Swedes rejected the euro, must be respected.
Swedish participation in EMU and the introduction of the euro are not live issues for the foreseeable future.
Â Â  . The rapporteur seems to be blind to the major disadvantages the euro has brought in its train, not least to his own country.
In the Netherlands, prices soared after the euro was introduced, something that Mr Zalm, the Finance Minister and a member of Mr Maatenâs party, has denied for years, going on to tell the Dutch parliament a bare-faced lie about the guilderâs undervaluation, and so the Dutch peopleâs displeasure with the euro should come as no surprise to Mr Maaten.
Although my party asked for a referendum on the common currency at the time, Mr Maatenâs party blocked this request.
Mr Maaten now hopes, by means of a propaganda campaign, to be able to make up the shortfall of respect for the peopleâs opinion.
The campaigns that are to be launched in Member States that do not yet have the euro must be the last straw.
Member States decide for themselves what currency they want.
Surely we would not like it if Russia were to campaign over here to introduce the rouble in Europe?
We should let the Swedish, British and Danish people make up their own minds.
Unfortunately, the Dutch people were not able to speak out in that way.
Â Â  I believe that Sweden should participate in Economic and Monetary Union and I share the rapporteurâs positive attitude to the euro.
I have, however, chosen to abstain from voting on this report.
One of the main conclusions of the report is that the Commission should conduct an information campaign extolling the virtues of the euro.
I believe that information campaigns by the Commission are neither helpful nor appropriate if we want to see more people well disposed towards the euro.
That is not what we should be using taxpayersâ money for.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mr Maaten on his important report on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), particularly given the need to explain to the people how the euro and the EMU benefits them in their daily lives.
The successful creation of the euro zone is not complete â we still have to convince the citizens of Europe that they made the right decision.
This is the only way in which we can contribute towards consolidating monetary union in Europe and towards enhancing the euroâs credibility and stability.
It is inevitable that the euro zone will expand to include the countries of Eastern Europe.
This will entail drawing up an information plan as part of a wider information and communication strategy on the EU.
We need to keep a closer watch on instances of malpractice and excessive rounding up that may occur during the transition and to warn the population of a slight rise in inflation.
Â Â  . The Euro has clearly been an economic success in the countries that have adopted it - it has eliminated exchange risk within the euro zone, made travel easier and increased trade within the zone.
Nevertheless, it is dispiriting to note that despite the objective benefits of the euro and despite the generally smooth change over that occurred, seven years on, a significant section (about one third) of the public continues to have a negative perception of the euro.
Baffling as this may appear the Commission, Member States and other policy makers need to take stock of these perceptions and undertake steps to correct them.
This report could make a worthwhile contribution to that effect.
Â Â  . The only benefit the euro has brought is that people do not need to exchange currency when they go on holiday to another euro country.
Other than that, the general experience of most people in euro countries has been of the currencyâs drawbacks, such as higher prices for consumer goods and a reduction in the value of their savings.
They are annoyed about the constant cutbacks on public services that are being carried out in order to limit public spending and thus meet the requirements of the Stability Pact.
In his report, Mr Maaten reveals himself as an enthusiast for the euro, a âeurophileâ.
It is laughable that he should call the euro âthe most successful European project everâ.
Does he realise that the euro gave some people a reason to vote against the EU Constitution?
How does he explain that Member States without the euro are doing far better economically speaking?
His main concern is to help the governments of Sweden, Denmark and the UK persuade the public that the euro has been a success.
Such an admission of weakness is comparable to the campaign in favour of the EU Constitution in the Netherlands: the euro is talked up as a fantastic product, yet people have not yet got the message.
It is short-sighted and patronising to respond to serious public criticism with transparent campaigns.
Â Â  . The advantages â and the disadvantages, which of course exist â of the euro are there for all to see and it cannot be denied that our highest expectations have been met.
Whilst it is true that the economic situation in Europe is not a runaway success story, it is also true that the euro cannot be blamed for this situation.
Indeed, the citizens have taken to the new currency very positively and the speed and ease with which the transition took place should not be forgotten.
It should also be borne in mind, however, that the euro is in fact a work in progress and as such is an easy target both for genuine popular disenchantment with the economic situation in Europe and for a certain amount of political manipulation.
This currency is too valuable to be discarded.
I therefore feel that we should agree on a more wide-ranging and complete communication plan, especially at institutional level.
It is clear that this is an ongoing transition process.
The initial effort needs to be kept up.
Â Â  . The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted in favour of this report in view of evaluating the European Monetary Union's strengths and weaknesses, to propose solutions and to aid the strategy for other Member States' entry into the Union if they so wish.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party believes that information on the Euro should be made widely available to all citizens of the EU.
This however, does not negate the Chancellor's 5 Economic tests set for any future decision on the UK's entry to the Euro zone.
Â Â  I have today chosen to abstain from voting on MrÂ Maatenâs report on a communication strategy on the euro and Economic and Monetary Union.
I share the rapporteurâs positive attitude towards the euro and believe that Sweden should participate in EMU.
What I do not, however, support is the Commission conducting an information campaign extolling the virtues of the euro.
Information campaigns conducted by the Commission are not the right route to go down in order to have more people well disposed towards the euro.
That is not what we should be using taxpayersâ money for.
Â Â  . According to this report, sustainable development is based on three pillars: environmental protection, economic development and social cohesion.
Furthermore, sustainable development cannot be achieved without the development of new environmental technology and innovations.
It is on these principles that the Commission has based its proposal, which Parliament adopted, although a number of points should be brought to the fore, such as the need for small and medium-sized enterprises to be more involved.
A further important point to bear in mind is that, in order to foster sustainable development, it is also necessary to encourage research into, and innovation in, new technologies focused on prevention and the restoration of natural, cultural and historical resources.
Similarly, methods and environmental indicators must be developed for measuring the burden on the environment of different products, services and processes, and a campaign must be launched, based on environmental performance information, to encourage consumers to demand environmentally benign technologies.
The reuse of materials should also be encouraged so as to enable residue materials from one production process to become the input of other production processes, for example the use of municipal waste to achieve energy savings, whereby economic as well as environmental benefit can be attained.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the communication from the Commission on stimulating technologies for sustainable development - an environmental technologies action plan for the EU.
I see it as a useful basis for discussion and development of more concrete proposals on how to boost environmental technologies but would like to see more emphasis on the development of the demand for such technologies.
I would like to seem a more systems-based approach to environmental policy using "life-cycle" thinking where great importance is attached to the innovation and development of environmentally benign technologies.
I firmly believe that environmental technologies properly resourced and encouraged have great employment and growth potential.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Myller report.
I feel that an approach to new technology that facilitates the creation of development programmes with an environmental dimension is a vital factor in meeting the Lisbon objectives.
The proposed action plan will make it possible to involve all stakeholders in an integrated action to develop the potential of environmental technology, thereby placing the EU at the forefront of that development.
I should also like to point out that one of the conclusions of the review of the Lisbon Strategy was that the state of the environment and improving employment should be seen as an opportunity to fulfil the objective of creating the most competitive knowledge-based economy.
It is therefore extremely important that we enhance the environmental dimension in the EUâs strategy for competitiveness.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of a report in support of the fight against harmful child labour.
It is very important vigorously to combat child labour, as defined in the ILOâs conventions on child labour, that is damaging to childrenâs physical or mental health.
Businesses have an important role to play and a responsibility for combating this type of child labour.
The proposal to establish suitable protection clauses and mechanisms under Community law for tracking down and prosecuting EU-based importers who bring in products manufactured by children is well meaning.
We Moderates believe, however, that this would lead to significant legal uncertainty.
There is a danger of childrenâs interests not being protected and of businesses withdrawing instead of playing their part and investing in regions where there is a risk of child labour being exploited.
Â Â  . Child labour is a consequence of the social injustice engendered by the capitalist system under which we live and by the inequality of wealth distribution and of development levels arising from that system.
Poverty leads to social exclusion and acts as a justification for families to turn to child labour to supplement their incomes and to survive.
The poverty endured by families as a result of capitalist exploitation means that some businesses and entrepreneurs have a vested interest in perpetuating a situation in which they can employ cheap labour with no rights.
As the report that we have just adopted points out, 113Â thousand million children of school age are deprived of basic education.
The fact that children do not attend school leads to a vicious circle, in which poverty becomes more widespread, access to culture and education becomes ever more difficult and literacy levels in society are kept low.
This is also happening in EU Member States.
In Portugal, it is estimated that more than 4% of the child population is working in various sectors.
If we are to combat child labour effectively, the priority is therefore to eradicate poverty, by breaking down inequality in income distribution, by promoting jobs with rights, by increasing access to teaching and culture and by combating capitalist exploitation.
Â Â  The European Parliament has today voted in favour of a proposal concerning measures to combat child labour.
Child labour is something that most people, including myself, think belongs to history.
Unfortunately, not all countries in the world have kept up with developments.
That is why I have today voted in favour of a number of additional proposals that divide child labour into several categories, since child labour may, for example, be the only alternative to prostitution.
Â Â  . At present, 246 million children in the world work in places that are hazardous for their physical and mental health.
Child labour is not a phenomenon associated exclusively with underdeveloped or developing countries.
In Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean, millions of children are exploited in work places.
Child labour is a complex issue.
It is primarily the result of poverty, inequality of opportunities and a lack of schooling.
I voted in favour of the report before us, which proposes a series of measures in the fight to eliminate child exploitation and child labour: for example, creating a special budget line focusing on the protection of childrenâs rights in the context of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights; calling on the Commission to ensure that the EUâs trade policies are consistent with its commitment to protecting and promoting childrenâs rights; and looking into the possibility of introducing a scheme for the labelling of goods imported into the EU to attest that they have been produced without the use of child labour.
Â Â  . I welcome this Report which calls for the fight against child labour to be accelerated through promoting socio-economic development and the reduction of poverty on a wider scale.
While satisfying for one's own conscience, trade boycotts and other sanctions are an unsatisfactory way of dealing with this unpleasant activity.
Evidence suggests that children thrown out of factories in desperately poor conditions are subject to even more insidious exploitation such as prostitution and domestic slavery.
Â Â  . There are 352Â million children working in the world, 179Â million of whom are victims of what the International Labour Organisation defines as the worst forms of child labour.
We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation.
We all know that this is a complex phenomenon rooted in social and economic problems that are difficult to solve.
Complex and enormously difficult though the situation is, we cannot turn our backs on it or block measures that may lead to an effective strategy to break the cycle of human misery.
Child labour perpetuates poverty and hampers development. It drives salaries down, causes unemployment among adults and prevents children from receiving an education.
It is therefore of crucial importance that we combat ignorance and promote the development of education for all.
Education is without doubt one of the most effective tools at our disposal to break the cycle of poverty, and one of the key elements in sustainable human development.
These are the reasons why I voted in favour of the Mavrommatis report.
Â Â  . We must do everything that we can to oppose the exploitation of children in the developing world.
This report links directly into the âMaking Poverty Historyâ campaign as child exploitation is so often linked to poverty.
We must do all that we can to make trade fair, to support debt relief and to secure aid to the poorest.
I hope that Members will sign our written declaration on the millennium development goals which will deliver on this crucial agenda.
I also hope that the G8 leaders meeting in Scotland tomorrow will make further progress on âMaking Poverty Historyâ.
Â Â  Today, the European Parliament has adopted a report that presents proposals concerning a variety of efforts to combat child labour.
The report states, for example, that education for all is crucially important in the fight against child labour and poverty.
It is my firm view that all children must be protected against work that causes harm to them.
It is, however, important to remember that general bans are not a realistic alternative so long as widespread poverty exists and there are limited opportunities for education.
Certain forms of work, for example those through which education is made available in the workplace, may, moreover, have a positive contribution to make.
The report also deals with the responsibility of businesses and proposes, for example, legal proceedings against businesses that import products manufactured in ways that violate core ILO conventions.
I believe that full use should be made of the potential that exists for economic players to increase respect for human rights and international conventions.
I therefore strongly support initiatives such as âGlobal Compactâ and the Swedish Governmentâs âGlobal Responsibilityâ.
Passing legislation and making it possible to take proceedings at EU level would, however, be very major steps that might, rather, be in danger of defeating the objects, namely those of improving the position of children and combating poverty.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- the interim report (A6-0177/2005) by MrÂ Konstantinos Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund [COM(2004)0492 â 2004/0163(AVC)],
- the interim report (A6-0178/2005) by MrÂ Alfonso Andria, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund [COM(2004)0494 â 2004/0166(AVC)],
- the report (A6-0184/2005) by MrÂ Giovanni Claudio Fava, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund [COM(2004)0495 â C6-0089/2004 â 2004/0167(COD)],
- the report (A6-0206/2005) by MrÂ Jan Olbrycht, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a European grouping of cross-border cooperation (EGCC) [COM(2004)0496 â C6-0091/2004 â 2004/0168(COD)],
- the report (A6-0216/2005) by MrÂ JosÃ© Albino Silva Peneda, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund [COM(2004)0493 â C6-0090/2004 â 2004/0165(COD)],
- the report (A6-0217/2005) by MrÂ David Casa, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Fisheries Fund [COM(2004)0497 â C6-0212/2004 â 2004/0169(CNS)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, I think that today the European Parliament, following the Council's failure to reach agreement on the financial perspectives and, obviously, also on the framework for regional policy for the period 2007-2013, is sending a clear message to both the citizens and the Council that we are here; we continue to support cohesion policies and we shall work towards a strong budget which is adequate in all instances for regional policy.
Within this framework, we call on the Council to immediately re-examine the question and to come to a decision soon, by the end of 2005 at least, so that there is enough time for the Member States and the regions to prepare their programmes and so that we do not have the problems of delays which we had in the present period as regards the starting date of the programmes.
In addition, I wish to point out that Parliament persists, including within the framework of my report, in the position which it took in the BÃ©guin report as regards the financing of cohesion policies.
We support a package in the order of 0.41% of the gross national income of the Member States of the European Union, which translates into EUR 336 billion for the period 2007-2013.
We consider that any cuts in spending on regional policy will undermine its credibility.
My report, as approved by the Committee on Regional Development, also contains other important forecasts, of which I should like to remind both the British minister present and the Commissioner.
First of all, we propose to re-use unspent resources due to the strict application of the N+2 rules on regional policy.
We propose that, instead of being re-entered in the net contributions to the European budget, these resources should be re-used by the cohesion countries and the regions which have proven from their performance that they can make use of other such resources.
Secondly, we are calling for there to be political decisions, so that compensation can be given to the regions and the Member States which suffer most from the strict implementation of the new rules which the European Commission is proposing regarding the allocation of resources.
We consider that it is a proposal which needs to be examined by the Council.
I imagine that it will be examined, because it bears directly on the fair allocation of resources.
We must not put mathematics above all else.
Similarly, within this framework, amendments have been tabled which are supported by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for better treatment of the regions which are subject to the statistical effect.
We propose support starting at 85% and ending at 60%, which is much higher than the European Commission forecast.
As far as natural effect regions are concerned, by which we mean regions which no longer meet the eligibility criteria for the convergence objective, but which will receive transitional financing within the framework of the competitiveness and employment objective, we propose that the actions and the financing for them should be the same for these regions, if they so wish, as the convergence objective regions.
We are also calling for more favourable treatment both of these regions and of the regions subject to the statistical effect as regards state aid and investment incentives.
We support the creation of a Community performance reserve which is expected to give an incentive to all the Member States to improve their performance and achieve real development.
Through rivalry we shall have better results both for the Member States and for the Community budget.
Finally, my report sets accessibility for people with disabilities as an express precondition to the financing of actions via the funds.
We consider that all projects which are not accessible to our fellow citizens with disabilities should not be financed from the Structural Funds and that their financing should be suspended.
It is the least the European Parliament can do.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that I present today has been characterised, in its formal drafting phase, by a method of work firmly rooted in dialogue, even going beyond individual political affiliations, and in intense collaboration, firstly within the parliamentary Committee on Regional Development and then within the Committee of the Regions, with representatives of the Council and the very many associations and non-governmental organisations.
I felt it necessary to give particular attention to the contact and exchange of opinions with fellow Members, with the shadow rapporteurs for the political groups and with the draftsmen of the other parliamentary committees, not to mention with members of the group to which I belong, that is to say, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
From the outset, I greatly welcomed â and I should like to repeat it publicly in this House â the special attention of CommissionerÂ DanutaÂ HÃŒbner, who, on the numerous occasions on which we met and even as recently as yesterday evening, always demonstrated a great willingness and openness to take account of Parliamentâs requests.
I have, moreover, always regarded with great interest the original proposal of the Commission on a regulation for the Cohesion Fund, which today, like the crisis that has swept across the Union and the failure to agree on the financial perspectives, assumes greater importance, since it provides a suitable response to the needs of an enlarged Europe by aiming at economic and social cohesion.
I therefore share the hopes expressed by MrÂ Hatzidakis with regard to the swift resolution of the issue of the financial perspectives before the end of the year.
Regional policy is the best means of bringing the citizens closer to Europe, and, in order to do so, it must have ambitious objectives and be equipped with the necessary instruments to achieve them.
I should therefore like to stress the importance of increasing the financial allocation of the Cohesion Fund from the EURÂ 18 billion estimated for the 2000-2006 programming period to EURÂ 62.99 billion, in the event that an agreement is reached in the Council on the proposal adopted by Parliament on 8 June.
Furthermore, the increased scope of the actions of the Cohesion Fund complies with the relevant provisions of the Treaty, is in line with the priorities decided on at Lisbon and falls within the perspective of sustainable development outlined in Gothenburg.
That will make it possible to meet the major funding needs of beneficiary Member States in the sectors of the environment, transport infrastructures and sustainable development.
During the work that I carried out within the Committee on Regional Development, I sought to make a number of changes and to enrich the Commissionâs text with a series of original points, such as introducing a premium system in the shape of a Community reserve for quality and performance and strengthening exchanges by promoting best practice for national, regional and local authorities.
I have asked the Commission to draw up a list of indicative priorities in the programming period, with a view to increasing the quality and effectiveness of Community funding.
I have highlighted the topic of disabilities, calling for an explicit reference to disabled people to be included in Article 2 of the general regulation and for the projects financed by the Cohesion Fund to include the possibility of removing barriers and obstacles of every description.
I have also made room for the important issue of the environment, calling for guarantees of greater consistency between the projects financed by the Cohesion Fund and those financed within the scope of other Community programmes.
Finally, I have made an explicit reference to the island and peripheral Member States, inviting the Commission to take account of their natural and demographic handicaps.
MrÂ President, with regard to the amendments tabled I also have to add that I personally do not believe â and I also say this on behalf of my group â that it is possible to adopt everything relating to the issue of the non-application of the N+2 rule to the Cohesion Fund, that is, introducing automatic decommitment.
My past experience as a local government administrator taught me that that rule contributes effectively to preparing projects correctly and accurately and to managing funds.
I therefore hope that the Commission allows greater flexibility in applying it and addresses the issue of non-refundable VAT in order that it may be allowed for the financing of the funds.
On this subject, there exists a rather precise position, to which CommissionerÂ Danuta HÃŒbner wished to once again draw attention in committee yesterday, which says that allowing VAT would mean reducing the financial resources available for the rest of the cohesion policy.
A very large majority in committee approved my report and I hope that the same thing can happen in this Chamber.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too thank the Commissioner and the other rapporteurs.
I believe that we have devised a path of work that benefits everyone, including in view of the quality of the reports that we are submitting to the vote in Parliament.
I am dealing with the European Regional Development Fund, which is without doubt the most important of the Structural Funds in terms of quantity of resources.
It was set up 30 years ago and has the crucial task of correcting the regional imbalances present throughout Europe.
It is a task laid down by an article of the Treaty, pointing out to us the requirement for, and the necessity of, a Europe founded on solidarity and on the ability to create equal opportunities and fair conditions, particularly now that we find ourselves faced with the challenge of enlargement.
The ten new Member States represent a large resource in terms of the quality of policies, a significant step forward in the history of Europe.
We must also remember, however, that regional imbalances are becoming worse.
Right now, a third of all of Europeâs resources belong to a geographical area covering only a tenth of the European Union, and we have recorded a doubling in the number of regions eligible to come under Objective 1, that is, regions with a high level of structural imbalances and economic difficulties.
That is therefore the fundamental task of a policy of engagement and solidarity.
If the Union were just a free trade area, we could confine ourselves to redistributing the income among the wealthiest regions and the poorest regions.
In contrast â and for this I am grateful to the Commissioner â we have the choice of a political, social and economic project entrusted to the Structural Funds, or rather the choice of a development model that, in its entirety, benefits the process of European integration.
It is a development model that makes a number of significant choices.
It favours the choice of subject matter made in Gothenburg and Lisbon and therefore chooses the path of the knowledge-based economy, knowledge, innovation, scientific research and training, intended as a permanent opportunity throughout peopleâs entire lives, as well as risk prevention and sustainable development.
It is an extremely ambitious project that naturally has one objective that cuts across the others, that is, the quality of spending.
MrÂ President, Commissioner, we have not always spent everything, and, even when we have done, we have not always spent it well.
There are regions â including in my country â that have received considerable resources but where there remain the unwavering signs of hardship that they experienced 10, 15 or 20 years ago with regard to employment levels, the quality and interlinking of infrastructures, scientific research and the processes of innovation.
It is therefore clear that we have to achieve a great improvement in quality in terms of the adequacy of spending, and, in order for this to occur, we have to select objectives by setting a small number of priorities.
It is for that reason that our group is against the wish â which is understandable but unnecessary â of indiscriminately enlarging the fields in which this structural fund may be used.
We propose a vote against a number of the amendments that would seek to introduce too many objectives and too many priorities.
We propose voting against the understandable desire of a number of Members to include VAT among reimbursable expenses.
We do not wish to reopen a debate that has been thoroughly aired in committee, but we believe that value-added tax, as was pointed out by the Council, the Commission and the Court of Accounts, gave rise in the past to significant misuse when a proportion of VAT was reimbursed.
We believe in particular that including this would create intolerable inequality among countries with VAT rates varying between 1% and 25%.
This also relates to the construction of new housing.
We approved an amendment, which we hope will be adopted by the Commission, relating to the construction of social housing.
However, to consider that Structural Funds could be generally invested in the construction of housing would mean fundamentally withdrawing resources from such funds.
We are satisfied with the results achieved.
We have strengthened the role of the partnership, which we consider a great school for teaching civilisation and democratic practice.
We have succeeded in ensuring that special attention is also paid to the fight against organised crime and mafia-related crime, laying down the possibility of also using the Structural Funds to create the necessary know-how for tackling the pervasiveness of mafia-related crime.
We have also succeeded in ensuring that the principal of non-discrimination applies across the board.
On this subject, the rapporteur has tabled only two amendments, the purpose of which is to enhance the unity and consistency of the entire text.
I will conclude by pointing out, like Mr Hatzidakis, that the quality of our spending is, however, dependent on the existence of sufficient resources.
That is why I believe that this Parliament has to ensure that resources are not withdrawn from solidarity, or rather from the ability to create a Europe that all moves at the same speed.
It is not solely a question of a principle laid down in the Treaties, but it is the principle to which we have to entrust the future of the political and economic integration process in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Michael, if I may, I should like to make a few comments on the report.
I will attempt to speak in my capacity as rapporteur, and not as a representative of my political party.
Cross-border cooperation is one of the most obvious and effective forms of building links between individuals and of promoting good relations between local and regional communities and whole countries.
Cross-border cooperation already has a rich tradition, and has achieved considerable success over the many years it has been in place.
Diverse organisational forms have also been developed for such cooperation.
The EU is aware of the many benefits that can be derived from this form of international cooperation, and therefore supports it both within the EU, along the borders between Member States and between regions that are some distance from each other, and along the EUâs external borders.
Various kinds of financial instrument are used to this end.
The present programming period has seen a great many measures implemented on a cross-border, trans-national and inter-regional basis, to use the terminology of the INTERREG IIIA, IIIB and IIIC programmes.
The regulation under debate is a new legislative proposal, which may help both to boost numerous forms of cross-border, trans-national and inter-regional cooperation, and to make it easier to implement joint initiatives and to ensure that funds for such purposes are used more efficiently.
The new regulation gives public authorities at all levels the opportunity to establish a new instrument on the territory of one of the chosen countries.
This instrument will have legal status in the country where it is registered, and will subsequently be notified to all Member States, the European Commission and the Committee of the Regions.
This corresponds to the proposal in my report.
The entities making up a European Grouping of Cross-Border Cooperation â the original text uses the term âcross-borderâ, but I have proposed in my report that this be replaced with the term âterritorialâ â will be able to transfer selected public services to the Grouping, as well as entrusting it with some of their tasks, as provided for in the relevant regulations.
The establishment of such instruments is perhaps one of the first proposals in the history of the European Union that provides for the creation of a truly European entity, at the same time as providing a practical boost to the enforcement of the principle of subsidiarity.
In my opinion, Parliament should back this idea, in so doing sending out a very clear and measurable signal that it supports these actions at local, regional and national scale, and also at inter-local and inter-regional level and between the countries that are engaged in the task of constructing a coherent EU, while at the same time strengthening the principle of subsidiarity.
It is worth stressing that even though this regulation does not contain any decisions relating to financial matters, it is part of a package on cohesion policy.
This is due to the fact that it is based on the Treaty provisions regarding the creation of forms to promote the use of the Structural Funds, as well as actions to be taken outside the Structural Funds.
In my capacity as rapporteur, I am aware that many questions and doubts have arisen in the course of work on this instrument.
This is quite normal in situations where we are dealing with a new instrument which has not yet been tested, and which does not yet have any equivalent in existing legal forms.
I believe, however, that in this instance the codecision procedure will subsequently make it possible to achieve a position that will boost the cross-border actions that are currently in existence, and that will allow us to create a considerable degree of European added value.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the European Social Fund (ESF) has a history dating back 40 years.
It was originally a key factor in developing the vocational training and the relocation of over 2Â million people working at the time in sectors affected by major restructuring.
Following the adoption of the first Social Action Programme and the European Single Act, the ESF became concerned with employment protection, worker participation, equal treatment for men and women, health and safety and preventing social dumping.
The most important landmarks in the development of European social policy â and, accordingly, in relation to the ESF â came subsequently with the Maastricht Treaty, which enshrined the promotion of a high level of employment as one of the EU's objectives, and with the Amsterdam and Nice Treaties.
The latest such landmark is the Constitutional Treaty, which enshrines full employment, social progress and action to combat exclusion as EU objectives.
In light of this development, the Commission tabled a proposal to review the regulation of the ESF, which was based on the following three headings: firstly, the Lisbon Strategy; secondly, the need to simplify texts and procedures; and thirdly, the relationship between the ESF and the European Employment Strategy.
I shall now deal with the first of those, the Lisbon Strategy.
With specific regard to the modernisation of the European social model, investment in people, action to combat social exclusion and a set of priority actions such as the establishment of a European Research and Innovation Area, investment in education and training systems with a view to satisfying the requirements of a knowledge-based society and meeting the need to create more and better jobs, I feel that the proposed regulation is an appropriate instrument.
I now turn to the simplification of texts and procedures.
Although it is true that the Commissionâs proposals already advocate simplification in various areas, such as programming, financial management and cofinancing, it is also true, nonetheless, that there remain many areas in which further simplification and rationalisation are called for.
As for the relationship between the ESF and the European Employment Strategy I wish to state that, broadly speaking, both are satisfactorily incorporated in the proposal for a regulation on the ESF.
I should now like to speak about the two amendments that I have tabled to the Commissionâs initial proposal.
The first of these concerns social inclusion.
I feel that issues relating to social inclusion cannot be resolved exclusively under the employment and labour market umbrella, given that there are situations that, at an earlier stage, call for more wide-ranging interdisciplinary measures.
I therefore felt that the ESF needed to be more proactive and, accordingly, I proposed that ESF action should not be confined to the sphere of the European Employment Strategy, because it has a broader scope for action.
In other words, I wanted to emphasise the ESFâs potential contribution towards social inclusion.
The other significant amendment to the Commissionâs proposal currently before Parliament concerns the distinction that was originally made between potential ESF action in âconvergence objectiveâ and âcompetitiveness objectiveâ regions.
I have always believed that the ESF should have as wide a scope of application as possible, because it is an instrument that is designed to help people, regardless of where they come from.
Talks between the Commission and the political groups involved have led to a compromise solution that is consistent with policy and that ensures that resources are channelled into regions with the greatest development needs.
This is the compromise solution that I now put to this House.
I am aware that there are points on which the Commission and the Council disagree.
In my proposal, I have made my opinion clear on these issues.
For example, I share the Commissionâs opinion as regards transnational cooperation and innovation, and have proposed that financing by the Member States be compulsory.
On support for social partners, I also share the Commissionâs position, and have proposed that a distinction be enshrined as regards a number of regulatory issues between social partners and non-governmental organisations.
Lastly, Mr President, I should like to highlight the highly cooperative atmosphere between the Commission and the various interested political groups while this report was being drawn up.
This dedicated cooperation made my work a great deal easier. I am grateful to all concerned.
Â Â  . â A Fisheries Fund is a fundamental tool for the fisheries sector for the coming years.
It is universally recognised that the fisheries sector is a very important sector for the European Union; it is an industry that provides a livelihood to thousands of families.
They are, indeed, dependent on this activity, which is so important to most of the Member States of the European Union.
The European Fisheries Fund is an innovative project and will achieve the crucial objective of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, thereby making it possible for the system whereby funds are distributed to be simplified and decentralised, and enabling the European Union to meet the challenges resulting from the accession of ten new Member States.
The Common Fisheries Fund respects the fundamental principles of all the other structures, namely subsidiarity, multiannual programming and scrutiny, membership and cofinancing.
One positive aspect to it is aid from the proposed European Fisheries Fund will involve locally-integrated action centred on a relevant territorial strategy, with every local situation analysed separately.
First of all it provides a financial instrument forming an integral part of the Common Fisheries Policy, with the specific intention of monitoring the management of resources, helping to improve production structures and to create the ideal conditions for their sustainable development.
Secondly, it conforms with the principles of cohesion, which permit different treatment in different regions of the European Union according to their level of development and prosperity.
This Houseâs Fisheries Committee went through a process of detailed consultation.
We met all parties involved in this sector, we consulted the fishermen and the representatives of the Member States and we wanted this report to eventually reflect accurately this sectorâs needs.
Although the Member States have given a favourable reception to the creation of a European Fisheries Fund with an objective that goes hand in hand with the reform of the Fisheries Policy, there was some concern about the fact that the Fund does not adequately address the renovation of vessels.
Representatives proposed that the draft regulation should make provision for fleet renovation and modernisation while at the same time keeping open the possibility of building new vessels without any increase in the fishing effort.
The general opinion is that the Commission focused too much on the environmental aspect and took no cognisance of the potential risk of certain measures to the fisheries sector.
We could, perhaps, with the help of scientific research, arrive at a more constructive and balanced compromise and thus create a balance between the protection of resources and the sectorâs socio-economic viability.
I believe that the report on which we will be voting tomorrow takes good account of the needs of all those who work in this sector.
By this we want to send a strong message both to the Commission as well as to the sector and we want the fisheries sector to remain sustainable and viable in the coming years.
I believe that it is fundamental for us that there is agreement on the principles which will allocate funds to the fisheries industry.
Unfortunately the proposed allocation for the European Fisheries Funds remained practically the same, namely about EURÂ 5 billion, even though the European Union has had to increase its rate because it is now composed of twenty-five Member States rather than fifteen.
It follows that comparison with the past will reveal that every country will receive a smaller percentage of the funds.
The protection of the environment is something that causes a lot of concern, and the excessive use of precautions leads to over-protection.
It is also worth mentioning that assistance will be available through this Fund.
Our hope is that this report will result in greater flexibility, and for that reason we appreciate that the European peoples expect us to remove unnecessary bureaucracy.
I believe that all those involved in the drafting of the report had all this in mind and did all they could to eliminate this factor.
As I have already said, we have reached an agreement on the renovation of vessels, which is a very important point, we have reached an agreement on the modernisation of fleets and the renovation of coastal vessels and we need a fleet which would be competitive and efficient for the future so that the sector really remains sustainable.
As already said, the Committee for European Fisheries already mentioned various opinions on this subject and different aspects of the proposal were considered, including the problems of sustainable development, aquaculture and questions related to the fleet and implementation.
As rapporteur, I can say that I am satisfied with the final results.
I believe that this report has successfully brought together the most important points and, furthermore, that it carries sufficient political weight to enable the fisheries sector to remain viable and sustainable, both financially and from the environmental point of view.
I will conclude by reminding the House that we had a timetable which was halved in order for us to be able to cover all the items by today, and, had it not been for the help of my groupâs coordinator and advisor, as well as a number of other people, especially the representatives of the Commission and my personal staff, I do not think that we would have managed it all.
I thank everybody for their help.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am pleased to participate in this very important debate on the future of the structural and cohesion funds because the European Commissionâs package of five draft regulations are of great significance.
They will establish the overarching framework for the delivery of EU regional policy for the full seven years of the next financial perspective.
It will be very important indeed for the Council and the European Parliament to work in close cooperation to achieve a successful outcome.
The Committee on Regional Development has produced excellent reports on the draft regulations.
While there are some differences of opinion between the Council and Parliament on certain issues, we share many common objectives and concerns.
I wish to thank Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Andria, Mr Fava, Mr Olbrycht and Mr Silva Peneda for their hard work and helpful remarks in introducing the debate this afternoon.
I ought to point out to Mr Hatzidakis that I am speaking today on behalf of the Presidency and emphasising the need for agreement.
I say that because he referred to me as the UK Minister.
Today we are not discussing the level of the budget, though those who argue for a more disciplined budget believe that it would increase the credibility of the Union and lead to the improved targeting of resources to where the need is greatest.
But it is to the credit of everyone, and particularly to Parliament, that the practicalities of the Commissionâs proposed regulations are being discussed and developed in parallel with the budget discussion.
I know from meetings that Commissioner HÃŒbner takes a very practical view of these issues and I look forward to hearing her contribution and that of Commissioner Å pidla.
I am not ignoring Mr Casaâs report.
I know that Parliament will also be discussing the draft regulation for the European Fisheries Fund during this debate.
As the UK Minister responsible for regional policy, I cannot comment on this important dossier, but I will promise to pass on the comments to my colleague, Ben Bradshaw, the UK Minister for fisheries policy, and he will be visiting Parliament next week to engage in discussions on this important subject.
I would like to emphasise the importance that the UK Presidency attaches to making progress in this very important policy area.
We recognise that this involves working in effective partnership with the European Parliament.
A great deal of progress has already been achieved under the Netherlands and Luxembourg Presidencies, but there is still a lot to do.
Even when the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on the regulations, the Commission and Member States will need to complete important bilateral discussions before the new cycle of programmes can start and before money can start to flow, money that is badly needed to help regenerate the economies of the poorest parts of the Union, hence our wish to move forwards swiftly under our Presidency.
But, as I have acknowledged, these negotiations are closely linked with the wider discussions on the future financing of the Union.
The structural funds form the largest area of EU expenditure after agriculture, accounting for approximately 30% of the total EC budget.
We need to reach agreement on the EC budget before these regulations can be finalised.
We share the concerns of the European Parliament and many Member States â in particular the new Member States â about any delay in reaching agreement on the budget and the importance of ensuring there is a prompt start to the next cycle of structural funds programmes.
As Tony Blair said to you less than two weeks ago, we fully recognise the importance of reaching an agreement on the budget and we will make as much progress as possible during our Presidency.
However, it has to be the right agreement: one that equips the EU to deal effectively with the challenges of the 21st century, one that takes account of the wider debate on the future direction of the Union and one that meets the needs of new Member States in order to ensure that EU enlargement continues to be a success.
In addition to the issue of financing, there remain a number of other important issues that need to be resolved relating to the treatment of structural funds expenditure and the implementation of programmes.
We have been discussing these matters in the Council since last September and we have made good progress.
Our aim during the UK Presidency is to reach a consensus on outstanding technical issues in the regulations as swiftly as possible, so that the package of regulations can be finalised very quickly once the outcome of the future financing negotiations is known.
That is why I am very pleased that you are having this important debate today and that you will be voting shortly on the five reports.
That will ensure that the Council has a clear understanding of Parliamentâs views.
Those views will be very important in building a consensus between our two institutions and we will examine them very carefully in the Council as we move towards political agreement.
I look forward to listening to the remainder of todayâs debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, through many plenary sittings such as this and the unflagging work of its committees, your institution has always played a decisive role in the development of European cohesion policy.
The Commission appreciates the farsighted ways in which you have helped to bring into being and develop a policy which, besides its economic objectives, forms such a secure link between the European Union and its citizens.
This debate in which we are discussing the policyâs medium-term future is just the most recent example of these efforts.
Whilst expressing the Commissionâs recognition of your role and its gratitude, may I, on a more personal note, thank the four rapporteurs â Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Fava, Mr Andria and Mr Olbrycht â for the outstanding quality of their reports.
My thanks also to Mr Galeote Quecedo, who has steered the work of the Committee on Regional Development so efficiently.
Together they have set the stage for a fruitful discussion today.
In replying now to your proposed amendments I hope I can be as clear and convincing as the reports themselves.
As I said, we are discussing the future of cohesion policy until 2013.
In the years between 2007 and 2013 cohesion policy can build on its present results, but we have to look and move forward.
We can secure a growth dividend by involving regions more closely in our economic and social modernisation.
This is what is at stake in the present discussions on cohesion policy.
The Commission and Parliament see the advantage of having our regions and cities on side and it can only be beneficial if their role as key actors in Lisbon and GÃ¶teborg is enhanced.
It is with these overall objectives in mind that I would like to give you the Commissionâs reactions to the proposed amendments, a reaction inspired by our common goals.
The Commission is grateful for your support on many key points.
I will list some of them.
We have a common view on the architecture of the policy, one built around the objectives of regional competitiveness and employment, regional cooperation in a number of forms and of course convergence.
It is vital to boost the growth of the poorest regions and close the wealth gap between them and the rest of the Union.
Here EU cohesion policy has a starring role to play in raising aggregate productivity growth in the Union as a whole.
We have a common view on the imperative of concentrating finance on the poorest regions.
I fully share your opinion that the national strategic reference framework should be the object of the agreement between the Member States and the Commission. This agreement should provide the basis for the final decision of the Commission, in line with Article 26 of the draft General Regulation.
We also have a common view on the essential role of cohesion policy in the drive towards a modern knowledge-based economy.
That is why it is important for the Council to adopt strategic orientations for the Union as a whole and why we propose that Member States should draw up national strategies for the pursuit of these objectives.
The report before you supports this view.
However, I must tell this House that the battle is not yet won.
We still have some way to go, therefore, to transform this part of the Commission proposal and the views of the European Council into a political reality.
The Commission and Parliament also have a common view on the importance of territorial cohesion or, to put it another way, the understanding that economic modernisation will benefit if special attention is paid to particular places in Europe.
The present urban initiative that was added to cohesion policy at the insistence of this House is a major success and the Commission wants to build on it by creating a special place not only for cities but also for rural areas.
We have proposed a special programme for the outermost regions and welcome your support.
These are some of the points where the resolutions before Parliament offer firm support for the Commissionâs proposals.
Others suggested by your rapporteurs will be taken on board by the Commission.
Perhaps I can give one or two examples.
Your resolution suggested that cohesion policy will be strengthened by better cooperation between ERDF co-financed operations and other Community policies.
I fully share your view and I am working to bring this about.
However, we all need to understand that the pursuit of this goal and the requirement that we concentrate our scarce financial resources mean that some kinds of project can no longer figure amongst our priorities.
You also suggest the maintenance of a specific strength for inter-regional cooperation within the objective for European territorial cooperation.
The Commission accepts this.
You have proposed that the interoperability between the regional and social funds be increased from 5% to 10%.
This gives greater flexibility to regional and national programme managers and thus ensures a close link in some cases between investment and training.
The Commission believes this to be very useful and accepts the proposal.
In the particular case of MrÂ Olbrychtâs report on European grouping for cross-border cooperation, I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission accepts most of Parliamentâs amendments.
Most important is the proposal that the registration of European groupings should be subject to national laws and associations.
Discussing the amendments that the Commission cannot accept is always a more delicate matter.
Here I will refer to one or two cases and hope that my explanations of the reasons behind the Commissionâs approach will convince the House.
I have already spoken of the need to focus cohesion policy on economic modernisation.
I have also said that this is especially important for the regional competitiveness and employment objective.
In this branch of the policy financial resources are particularly limited and, furthermore, we need to be able to demonstrate the added value to the overall economic situation.
In that light, I am worried by the amendments that seek to enlarge the scope of the policy, especially the regional competitiveness objective.
I understand why Members might believe the door should be opened a little wider here and there, but I would ask you to accept that, if we do not take great care, the policy will lose its ability to address key issues and key areas.
We have to find an appropriate balance.
For example, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to widen the scope of the policy generally to cover operating aid, or to soften the conditions covering land purchase.
This is not because of a lack of sympathy; it is an acceptance of the overriding need to concentrate the policy on the main challenges.
There are two particular points I should mention in this connection: VAT and housing.
The VAT and housing discussions arise from an effort by the Commission to simplify the regulation by clearly listing elements of expenditure that are not eligible for funding.
With regard to VAT, the discussions in the Council and the amendments put forward by honourable Members demonstrate that this part of the Commissionâs proposal creates some problems, especially in new Member States.
We want to avoid a position where ERDF cofinance goes straight into Member Statesâ budgets by cofinancing VAT payments.
That position is, I am sure, shared by this House.
At the same time I hear from you about problems: the cost for some beneficiaries, for example voluntary organisations and local governments, because the VAT they are obliged to pay is not recoverable.
In the coming weeks the Commission will therefore reflect on its proposal with a view to finding a solution to your concerns.
Much the same is true about housing, although the solution to the problem might not necessitate a change in the Commissionâs proposal.
Again, the Commission does not consider that housing expenditure should be eligible for co-financing under cohesion policy.
That is not a change from past practice. It is merely a clarification.
It is clear today from the amendments proposed by Members and from discussions in the Council that what was intended as a clarification might lead to confusion, thus complicating the lives of programme managers.
The way out appears to be to make a common declaration with the Council that spells out the sort of investments associated with housing that are eligible for ERDF co-financing.
Thus we would make clear, for example, that investments to improve the energy efficiency of housing are eligible for co-financing and that the same is true for investments to improve the environment around social housing.
Another area covered by Membersâ amendments is the automatic decommitment rule known as the n+2 rule, which will become applicable to the cohesion fund after 2007, since the Commission is proposing to move from the present project approach to the programme approach.
This is the discipline that lies at the heart of the present high-quality performance of official policy programmes and is having beneficial effects on the ground.
It turns out to be a strong incentive to efficient and rapid implementation of the programmes.
We recognise, however, that the application of this rule for the Cohesion Fund could bring difficulties, especially in the new Member States, as the major focus of this fund is on large infrastructure projects where the investment cycle and public procurement procedures are considerably longer and more complex.
We do not underestimate these problems.
For this reason, we have been working together with the Presidency and the Member States in order to reconcile the requirements of proper financial management and discipline with the specific nature of the Cohesion Fund.
The Commission cannot accept some suggestions by honourable Members that aim to alter the conditions for the implementation of the policy.
Here, of course, we have to remember the importance of achieving sound financial management which leads us to maintain clarity and a clear distinction between the General Regulation and the ERDF Regulations.
We have to remember the importance of decentralised management and the role of the regions and Member States in defining development strategies.
We also have to ensure that the regulations that emerge can be clearly understood and followed by programme managers and that they do not contain political messages or statements of intent.
It is on those grounds that the Commission is unable to accept a number of amendments.
You are fully aware of the difficult conditions under which the debate on the future financial framework is taking place.
The Commission needs your full support to ensure that an ambitious cohesion policy to achieve Lisbon and GÃ¶teborg objectives can be implemented by 2007.
By adopting your reports, you are giving a clear signal to the Council of your determination to take up this important challenge.
By choosing to discuss its position on the future shape of cohesion policy now, this Parliament is sending the message that there is no time to lose.
You are signalling that you want to secure a medium-term future for a cohesion policy before the end of the year.
The Commission supports you in this.
We are doing all we can to ensure that the necessary decisions are taken as soon as possible under the British Presidency, so that the Member States and regions have new cohesion policy programmes ready to come into operation at the start of 2007.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, if I may I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, MrÂ Silva Peneda, and all those who helped him, for the excellent work they have done.
Parliamentâs backing has been absolutely crucial to our formulation of a common objective that consists in establishing a legal basis that will enable the European Social Fund to promote the creation of more and better jobs.
The Commission proposals on the reform of the Structural Funds in general, and of the European Social Fund in particular, have a number of underlying principles.
Resources will be targeted at the Communityâs key priorities and at those regions that need them most.
Support will be provided for the European Employment Strategy, since this will allow the European Social Fund to make a direct contribution to achieving the Lisbon goals, as well as for individuals and those from disadvantaged groups.
When implementing the European Social Fund, the Commission will continue to give priority to all groups that have problems finding or staying in employment, irrespective of the cause of these problems.
One of the goals the Commission sets itself in the proposal is to achieve the widest possible involvement of all stakeholders who play a part in implementing the European Social Fund.
The social partners should play a leading role in the future European Social Fund, as they have a key part to play in implementing employment policies and in European Social Fund interventions.
The Commission shares Parliamentâs view that NGOs should be more involved in cohesion policy, and in fact it is for this reason that it has reinforced the principles of partnership.
The draft regulations already state that NGOs will be consulted on the programming, implementation and monitoring of measures taken under the European Social Fund.
The Commission would stress that NGOs must have access to activities funded under the European Social Fund, particularly in the case of those organisations operating in the field of social inclusion and the fight against discrimination.
The effort the rapporteurs have put into drawing up these reports will doubtless help us to draft an agreement more efficiently, as well as improving the final version of the proposal.
I should like to thank them for their work.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Casa, on his excellent work and thank the Committee on Fisheries and its chairman for their valuable contribution to the debate on the European Fisheries Fund.
I strongly appreciated the significant amount of work undertaken in order to achieve a timely delivery of Parliamentâs opinion, as well as the active involvement of Member States and the fishing sector in this debate.
I, myself, together with the Commission services, have travelled to various Member States to gather the opinions of administrations and the sector alike.
Despite the large number of proposed amendments, I believe that in substance your proposals are close to ours and I am pleased to note your generous support for our proposal.
This indicates that we have a common understanding that the new fund should serve the purpose of implementing the CFP and aim at achieving sustainable development of the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the Community.
I do not share the view of the rapporteur that the fund focuses too much on the environmental dimension.
It focuses on the attainment of sustainable fisheries in the long term in the interests of fishermen themselves â sustainability in all senses of the word: economic, social and environmental.
I now wish to say a few words on where we currently stand with the proposal.
As you know, the Council met on 20 and 21 June to discuss the proposal after significant work had been undertaken at the technical level.
Under the Presidencyâs stewardship we were able to progress towards a broad consensus with Member States, while taking into account the work that was ongoing in the Committee on Fisheries.
To mention only three areas where we have met your concerns, I refer to the extension of aid to medium-sized enterprises operating in the aquaculture processing and marketing sectors, to the inclusion of new provisions in support of small-scale fisheries and young fishermen, and to increased flexibility in the selection criteria for fisheries regions where local development strategies can be implemented.
We did not, however, conclude the discussions in the Council on 21 June.
Member States still have divergent opinions on aid for new constructions and modernisation of the fleet, with some of them requesting the reinstatement of aid for the construction of vessels.
I have expressed my position in the Council, which I wish to reiterate here.
I am not prepared to reopen the debate on aid for the construction of vessels, which was phased out during the common fisheries policy reform.
To do so in the context of over-capacity and over-fishing would undermine our determination to achieve sustainable fisheries and our commitment at international level not to subsidise the increase in fleet capacity.
We need not only a commitment that our own capacity is not increased, but we need to decrease capacity to attain sustainable fisheries.
Concerning support to vessel modernisation, the Commission is ready to accept some changes advocated by the Committee on Fisheries.
Firstly, by clarifying that aid will be available to modernise vessels below deck for safety, working conditions, hygiene and product quality purposes, provided capacity is not increased.
Secondly, by making safety-related items explicitly eligible under the European Fisheries Fund.
In many ways, the discussions in the Council mirror the arguments expressed by the European Parliament with regard to the restructuring of small-scale coastal fisheries.
I am convinced that specific attention to small-scale fisheries is justified because of their important role in the economic and social fabric of fishing communities, their territorial dimension and the competition they often face from other segments of the fleet.
We are, therefore, willing to include funding for the replacement of engines for small-scale vessels, while ensuring that capacity is not increased and stocks are exploited in a sustainable manner.
This could take place in particular in the framework of coastal management plans aimed at the sustainable development of fisheries for the benefit of local communities.
I am confident todayâs debate will contribute to improving further the content of the European Fisheries Fund proposal.
We shall continue our work with the Council to finalise its adoption in due time and I am committed to informing the Council of your outstanding concerns after todayâs debate.
Â Â  â President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to point out that I am speaking in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the issue of the Structural Funds.
In the time allocated to me, there is so much to say that I have decided to select a number of points which, with the budgetary orthodoxy of this Parliament, apply to all opinions and are relevant to the various reports concerned, both that of my colleague Mr Andria on the Cohesion Fund, and those on the ERDF, ESF and European Fisheries Fund, as well as the general opinion of our fellow Member Mr Hatzidakis on the Regulation laying down general provisions.
I also thank all my fellow Members for the vast amount of work they have undertaken.
The challenges facing Europe are now, more than ever, of critical importance for the development of the European Unionâs future competitiveness, for which the Structural Funds represent not only the indispensable financial instruments but also, today, in the current Europe of 25, which we are now building â in this Enlarged Europe â the spearhead for the Unionâs budgetary objectives and the essential vector for our ambitions for Europe.
I shall not refer again to the substantial work done by the Committee on Budgets or to that of the Parliamentary Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives.
While Europe is experiencing an unprecedented crisis, Parliament has assumed its responsibilities by adopting, in June, the BÃ¶ge report on the budgetary means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013.
It is true that, during the preparatory discussion on the Structural Funds, based on the Commissionâs proposal which focused on the three objectives of convergence, regional competitiveness and employment, and European territorial cooperation, we had no clear indication of the figures contained in the budget.
Today, the situation remains complex, not to say grotesque, to use the words of some of our fellow citizens: we are asked to express a view on the Structural Funds while still being unaware of the final amounts to be allocated to them if â as I and the vast majority of our colleagues hope â we manage to reach a rapid agreement on the financial perspectives.
In connection with two or three key matters, I should therefore just like to stress a few principles based on common sense and simple budgetary orthodoxy, which will enhance the role of the European Parliament as a budgetary authority.
The first is that once these financial perspectives have been approved, the Commission will, firstly, confirm the amounts indicated in the proposal for a regulation or, if applicable and necessary, submit the amended amounts for approval by the European Parliament and the Council to ensure they fall within the ceilings, as the Committee on Budgets is constantly pointing out that they should.
The second point, already referred to on many occasions, debated at length and regularly stressed in Parliamentâs Committee on Budgets, is to draw attention to the positive results of applying the N+2 rule and to propose that it should be retained as a matter of principle.
The Regulation laying down General Provisions and the Regulation on the Cohesion Fund stipulate that this N+2 rule should apply to the Cohesion Fund.
I would remind members that the aim of this rule is to encourage the beneficiary Member States to use the funds committed without delay, obliging them to use a degree of discipline in the preparation and financial management of projects.
However, aware of the potential difficulties for the new Member States in making rapid use of the Structural Funds, we, and, in particular, the rapporteur Mr Andria obtained, with great difficulty and after long discussions, a compromise whereby the N+2 rule would be relaxed in response to the requests from our new colleagues and should become sufficiently flexible to enable projects to be started and executed rapidly.
The time allowed under the N+2 rule will start to run on day 1 of the projectâs implementation, not on the first day of scheduling by the Commission, thereby creating the flexibility that will help us in achieving our aims.
Lastly, I shall not go back over the issue of non-refundable VAT, on which we wholeheartedly uphold the position of Commissioner HÃŒbner.
To conclude, the Committee on Budgets will ensure that its different positions adopted by Parliament are defended.
It is, of course, ready to begin negotiations without delay with the Council and Commission on the financial perspectives, to which it is strongly committed, believing that, contrary to the statements of Jack Straw reported in Le Figaro on 30 June, it would be extremely serious if we were unable to reach agreement before the end of this year.
If we delayed in reaching agreement, we must realise that the delay in implementing the policies would have serious economic and social consequences for our fellow Europeans.
However, despite this, it is important to be clear on one point: Parliament will not accept a bad agreement, and we shall have no hesitation in rejecting it.
Â Â  Mr President, we are all fully aware of the fact that the number of goals we are setting ourselves, and the number of needs that must be met, exceeds by far the funds at our disposal.
It is therefore quite obvious that these funds must be programmed as well as possible and put to the most effective use possible.
This is the aim behind the amendments that have been tabled to the next Financial Perspective.
It is quite incomprehensible, however, that certain principles that have proved their worth and functioned properly to date have been abandoned.
I am thinking in particular of the multi-fund approach, which makes it possible for the funds needed to implement a single task to be combined as effectively as possible at Member State level, or in other words for the money to be used as the country in question sees fit.
This approach is now going to be changed by restricting cross-financing to 5%.
Why change a rule that works well, and for which the administrative instruments have already been put in place and staff trained?
Why change a rule that allows for greater freedom of decision-making in operational planning and in implementing tasks?
Another issue I wish to raise is funding for housing.
I obviously agree with the changes proposed by the Commission to the effect that funding for housing is not permitted as such, and I am delighted that Mrs HÃŒbner has explained that expenditure on housing that results in energy savings and environmental protection is eligible.
Since I come from a new Member State, Poland, however, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that social housing in the countries of the former Communist bloc mainly consists of prefabricated blocks of flats, which are no longer environmentally friendly, and which in many instances are extremely unsafe.
It would therefore be worth giving some thought to whether it would be a good idea to fund the regeneration of such buildings under the Cohesion Fund, since it is impossible for the necessary number of homes to be completely rebuilt from scratch.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the fact that even while the European Union is experiencing constitutional and budgetary crises, we are debating the nature of the key instruments of European solidarity, namely the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the Social Fund.
It was solidarity that provided the foundations for the European project, and it is thanks to a policy of solidarity that the founding states have integrated so rapidly with the poorer countries of our continent.
Given that we are sitting in Strasbourg, it is worth noting that many years ago, thanks to the Marshall Plan, the economies of Western Europe were regenerated from their wartime ruins. This includes the German economy, which is now the most powerful in Europe.
It was the Communist governments of Central Europe that rejected the Marshall Plan, in so doing condemning their peoples to decades of backwardness in terms of development.
As MrÂ Juncker highlighted in his farewell speech, the policy of solidarity is the most important policy of the united Europe.
Unfortunately, this policy was not accorded its proper place in the otherwise excellent speech by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. It is a great shame that this was the case.
The new EU Member States are prepared to carry out reforms and to make changes.
We have been undertaking reforms for the past 15Â years, and we are not easily scared by the need to tackle new challenges.
These new Member States can therefore act as a natural ally for London in its desire to build a modern and affluent EU that is developing rapidly, and that is free of fears and anxieties.
We will not achieve such a thing unless we continue to pursue a policy of cohesion, solidarity and support for poorer countries and regions, as this is the most important aspect of EU policy.
New areas that promote balanced development, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, carbon dioxide collection and environmentally friendly public transport need to become eligible for funding.
Management of water networks should also be financed under the Cohesion Fund, in particular flood prevention programmes and the NaturaÂ 2000 network.
I also propose that the present principles governing the eligibility of VAT with regard to funding under the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund should be kept in place.
This is of key importance in terms of experience in benefiting from the Structural Funds.
Â Â  . â Mr President, when we talk of we must also include in it the contribution by the European Parliament, with the experience and the exceptional, constructive contribution by MEPs such as Mr Hatzidakis, who not only with this report on the proposal for a regulation laying down provisions for the European Structural Funds on which we are to vote, but also with a previous third report and the working paper last December, has contributed to the maintenance and strengthening of economic and social cohesion and is now also calling for specific reference to the territorial cohesion of the European Union.
The recommendations in the motion for a resolution and the specific proposals for certain changes or addenda to the Commission proposal will, we hope, help to formulate a position which is also politically acceptable to the Council for the preparation of a reliable budget for the period 2007-2013.
We welcome the rapporteur's proposal for a balanced Europe-wide polycentric model for sustainable development, with balanced development of the convergence objective and the competitiveness and employment objective regions and with flexible European cooperation.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I note with satisfaction that specific recommendations were incorporated into the report, such as the extension of the principle of equality between men and women, in order to ensure the absence of any form of discrimination.
This is supplemented by the call for an evaluation of the progress made in promoting equality of men and women and social inclusion.
It is also proposed that accessibility for the disabled should be a precondition to the securing of benefits from the funds.
We also highlight the rapporteur's suggestion for calculating the percentage of cofinancing, so that the participation of non-governmental organisations and non-profit-making organisations in Structural Fund activities is not affected.
As far as the European Social Fund is concerned, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Peneda, on his willingness to cooperate, so that the proposals in the new regulation for this fund will prove to be effective, especially for European men and women, with flexibility in the eligibility of convergence and competitiveness regions.
We note with satisfaction that the Peneda proposal emphasises the mainstreaming of equality between men and women and the abolition of discrimination in all policies, through special actions designed to increase the sustainable participation of women and promote their vocational training and careers, in accordance with the prospects of the Lisbon Strategy.
We note the lacklustre presence of measures to publicise the activities financed under the proposal for a regulation for the European Social Fund; these are needed to ensure that interested parties will have simple and fast access to them.
Â Â  . Mr President, the first thing we have suggested to the Committee on Transport and Tourism is that the Cohesion Fund aid should not just include the trans-European transport networks defined in the Decision of 1996, that is to say, those approved by the Essen Council, but also all of those identified by the high-level Van Miert Group, which also deals with the new Member States, motorways of the sea and the GALILEO project, all of which are included in our decision of last year, 2004.
Furthermore, with regard to the fields to which Cohesion Fund aid should be directed, we recommend that routes equivalent to motorways or state roads that connect trans-European networks also be considered and that rail rolling stock and collective means of transport be included, as well as the road infrastructure for coach and bus transport.
Finally, we suggest that the regulation we are debating today should not prevent the Council from extending the application of the Cohesion Fund, on an annually-decreasing basis during 2007-2013, to Member States whose wealth exceeds 90% of the European average, not because they have experienced positive developments in their economic growth, but because of the simple statistical effect of the incorporation into the union of new Member States with below average GDP.
Unless we do that, we will be deceiving ourselves.
Â Â  â Mr President, the report for an opinion on the Regional Development Fund, which I presented to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, was adopted unanimously on three priorities: achievement of the Lisbon objectives, a policy of sustainable full employment and an ambitious policy for people with disabilities.
This dossier goes far beyond social concerns and encompasses the Communityâs priorities, and it is likely to become the Unionâs dominant policy, ahead of the Common Agricultural Policy, in three areas, namely solidarity, effectiveness and justice.
Solidarity with the new Member States, but under certain conditions.
Respect for the internal marketâs competition rules.
Solidarity must not mean weakness.
I therefore agree with fellow Members, like our rapporteur Mr Fava, who propose not including VAT among reimbursable expenses and not reallocating resources that have become subject to automatic release under the N+2 rule.
These policies must be optimised.
Until now, we have seen that credits have been devoted to simple projects, to the detriment of projects of structural significance.
This mistake is regrettable and could be exacerbated by the performance reserve.
Our approach should be one of concentrating our focus on a reduced number of topics.
Solidarity and effectiveness: effectiveness means pursuing the aims of the Lisbon Agenda and investing in research and the development of employment.
Solidarity, effectiveness and justice: this policy must remain a Community policy, directed at all Member States.
I am grateful to Commissioner HÃŒbner for having agreed with this during her visit to my region â the Loire â last Thursday.
Uncertainty regarding the financial perspectives â as you have seen, Mr Michael â has not stopped us from giving our views on spending and on structural changes.
The British Presidency may well be faced with the same situation.
Finally, I would express the hope, certainly shared by our rapporteur Mr Fava, that a consensus may emerge on these reports similar to the one achieved on the BÃ¶ge report.
The subjects of both reports are related.
Parliament will perform its role all the more effectively if the Councilâs position is not too distant from the one we have defined.
In this difficult period, it is important that the European Parliament should remain committed to the Communityâs seriousness of purpose and ambition.
Â Â  . Mr President, today is a historic day for this House, which sees us continuing on the course of cohesion policy and solidarity in Europe, with gratitude to the rapporteurs for their farsightedness.
In todayâs debate, I should like to confine myself to new objective 2 and objective 3, promoting competition, innovation and inter-regional cooperation in Europe, which, in the Commission proposals, amount to a total package of approximately EUR 40 billion, thus also demonstrating that these objectives make a crucial contribution to the Lisbon objectives.
In yesterdayâs deliberations in the committee, Mrs HÃŒbner was right to talk in terms of the âLisbonisationâ of the structural funds.
In the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I called for private cofinancing to be increased in each amendment as a matter of priority.
By means of innovation, industry provides the tractive force, while Lisbon determines the course.
The government puts 1% on the table, industry 2%.
Secondly, structural funds should be specifically linked to objective 2 in the research and development budget.
The options for accelerating by means of open innovation, and research and knowledge in intensive production go hand in hand.
Commissioner Verheugenâs proposals for the CIP are also along these lines.
Thirdly, the SMEs should be given more opportunities to tap into these funds directly, with public knowledge being made available to them more rapidly, by means, for example, of the knowledge vouchers.
Fourthly, a fourth provision should be drafted with regard to access to funds for all border regions.
These should remain available for this purpose.
After all, Lisbon does not stop at the border.
Finally, the âLisbonisationâ has only just started and competition at world level is becoming even more cut-throat.
As a Dutchman, I have to conclude that there has been no debate, or only partial debate, on the new agenda for structural funds, and so we have to raise the level a few notches.
Outside, there is the , but this is a .
In the next debate in Parliament with the Council, on the ERDF criteria, for example, I think that we should elaborate on how the Lisbon objective can be specifically fleshed out.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is a set of very sensitive issues in the debates on structural and cohesion funds leading to conflicts of opinion that go beyond the political groups.
Most of the political groups are divided on the issues of the N+2 rule, VAT and public-private partnerships.
We must ensure that the poorest beneficiaries will benefit from the funds.
It is important that the aim of simplifying the regulations does not hamper the poorest beneficiaries in their attempts to apply for funds.
The reports as they stand regarding the rules on VAT and PPP would have terrible consequences for local authorities wishing to apply for funds.
These rules imply additional costs that the poorest beneficiaries will not be able to cope with.
We are not requesting more money.
On the contrary, we are just asking for the current regulation in this respect to be maintained.
It is simply not fair to change the rules of the game now that ten new Member States with lower socio-economic development have joined the Union.
This is not a conflict between the old and new Member States, or at least it should not be.
I urge you, therefore, to bear in mind the very principles of structural and cohesion policies.
These policies were designed to help the poorest and not to create additional difficulties for the beneficiaries.
We all acknowledge the fact that the Union is currently facing an important crisis.
We have to reflect seriously on what message our Parliament will send at this critical moment.
Therefore, I urge you, in the name of solidarity with the poorest, to support the amendments tabled on the issues of N+2, VAT and PPP.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, contributing to correcting regional imbalances is an objective of extraordinary interest and substance in this difficult period for Europe, provided that it offers the citizens a clear and understandable project.
The rapporteur for the European Regional Development Fund, MrÂ Fava, has carried out some excellent work in this direction; he has welcomed the contributions of the other committees whose opinions were sought and, based on a financial dimension that must not be decreased, he has set out a credible solution for reducing the disparities.
An essential part of this reduction is represented by gender mainstreaming.
The fact that the initial Commission proposal contained no explicit reference to mainstreaming as an added value means of restoring the balance in the regions was a worrying step backwards.
I therefore express my satisfaction, including on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, with the manner in which the report has succeeded in reintegrating this aspect and I call on the House to vote in favour.
I also call on the Commission and the representative of the Council not to consider that overcoming the gender imbalance is negotiable, including within the bodies for managing, overseeing and controlling the Structural Funds, which the Member States will have to create.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe it is an exaggeration for me to describe European structural policy as being at the heart of the European Union, or to compare cuts in it with the sort of risky heart surgery which can go wrong, or can leave the patient disabled, and is therefore best avoided.
I would like to point out to the British Presidency something we all know, that being that a body without a heart is dead.
Set your hand against structural policy, and you put the Community at risk.
I wish again to call on all those present in the Chamber to organise the European Structural Funds in such a way that they play as fundamental a role in the body as the heart: the body is healthy if all its parts are well, if they live in solidarity with one another and deal fairly with one another, rather than using the resources available to them to compete with one another to the point of their mutual destruction.
For that to happen, though, resources need to be deployed sustainably, efficiently and from the bottom up, enabling the weakest to be made strong and an appropriate response to development problems.
This House has produced a substantially better proposal than the Commissionâs for how this might be done with the new Structural Funds.
It is of the utmost importance that all its drafts give particular attention to the local level â as a recipient of support, as a programme level, and as a stakeholder.
I would therefore like again to stress the constant importance of the European Structural Funds when problems need to be addressed.
Both in small villages and in the run-down neighbourhoods of major cities, they make Europe visible and tangible for the inhabitants and are for that reason indispensable to Europeâs integration.
This is most apparent in the case of the European Social Fund, which Parliamentâs substantial improvements have made into a âfund for the little peopleâ, which springs into action where people are at risk of exclusion, gives support to those who have lost out, and inspiration where there is a need for innovation in the creation of jobs.
I would like to respond to what the Council Presidency has said by again emphasising the possibility of creating jobs even in regions that are already regarded as lost causes.
This Houseâs amendments make the ESF a superb instrument for this purpose.
Its conception runs directly counter to the idea that it is only by means of large-scale investments that competition can be fostered and jobs created.
It intervenes where there is a need for knowledge and the potential for innovation at a regional level, and, as problem areas are no exception in this respect, it is there that it can bring success.
I would again like to emphasise that the Commission has done nothing to back up its claim that EQUAL was to be absorbed wholesale into the ESF.
This makes Parliamentâs amendments particularly important as a means of ensuring that the whole approach is taken on board in an innovative way.
I would like to conclude by saying something about the partnership principle.
The Councilâs attempt to abandon it is a full-frontal assault on the democratic nature of the Structural Funds, for it is control by society that ensures that money is not squandered and is actually put to use where it is needed.
It follows that a greater emphasis on the partnership principle is vital to the Structural Funds.
While we endorse the Commissionâs proposal for the involvement of those partners who represent groups that are only now, and at last, gaining recognition in accordance with the anti-discrimination clause in the Treaty, these groups lack the know-how required in order to be able to deliver estimates and opinions as equal partners.
I am again addressing the Commission when I say that we do not believe it to be wise to play gender mainstreaming off against such groups.
Let me again observe that the European Structural Funds can be successful only as and when they take due account of the sustainability principle.
Â Â  Mr President, the full objectives of the European Fisheries Fund are commendable and clear: firstly, adjustment of fishing effort and better protection of the marine environment; secondly, aquaculture processing and marketing; thirdly, promoting collective interests, such as measures intended to protect aqua, aquatic fauna, fishing ports and the development of new markets; fourthly, sustainable development of coastal fishing areas.
There are, however, several real problems.
First of all, while the budget looks sizeable at EUR 4 963 million, it represents an increase of only EUR 0.7 billion on the previous budget for a seven-year period from 2007 to 2013.
Secondly, we have ten new Member countries, so there is no real increase.
Secondly, I am disappointed that this report ignores an amendment adopted by the Committee on Regional Development, that 25% of the Community financial contribution should be set aside for Axis 4: the sustainable development of coastal fishing areas.
Those are areas under threat.
The statistic is quite startling: 8 000 jobs are lost, on average, every year in direct fishing.
The coastal fishing areas are the most peripheral and are under threat.
What is needed is a fishing policy joined up with the regional policy, and there is scant reference to this in the report.
Several amendments from the rapporteur proposed grant aid for the replacement of fishing vessels, the upgrading and modernisation of fishing vessels, but no percentage limit has been set aside for that.
If we go down that road, the bulk of the fund will be swallowed up and the key objectives of the fund will not be realised.
It should be the responsibility of the Member States, subject to the approval of the EU, to assist in the purchase, modernisation and up-grading of replacement fishing vessels, but subject to the EU.
What we need is to protect and enhance fishing stocks.
The emphasis, as the Commissioner said, has to be on sustainability: protecting the aquatic environment so that this will happen, protecting the existing fishing communities that are so under threat.
Finally, we must enable fishing communities to diversify.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, in particular Mr Hatzidakis, Mr Fava and Mr Andria, whose work we have been able to follow closely in the Committee on Regional Development, which has been intimately involved in the debate.
They have offered a wonderful example of dedication, compromise and a will to seek agreement.
I would also like to congratulate Commissioner HÃŒbner, because his determination that our legislative work should make progress has helped us to overcome the discouragement that followed the failure of the last Council.
I hope that the vote in plenary tomorrow will be correctly understood by the Council as a demonstration of the European Parliamentâs determination that the cohesion policy should continue to be built upon an essential pillar of European integration.
I would like to draw the British Presidencyâs attention to this because some may take the view that by opening up very general debates â though they are undoubtedly very important â we could end up failing to conclude anything.
There is no need to point out that it is already too late for the Commission to draw up the programmes implementing the Funds by January 2007.
If we had to wait until spring next year for the Council to reach an agreement, the Commission would not be able to go ahead with the first payments until 2009, which would be dramatic for the cohesion policy in general and in particular for the new Member States, to whom the United Kingdom has always expressed its commitment.
I believe that the European Parliamentâs contributions will be acceptable, in particular the compromises on such sensitive issues as the N+2 rule, VAT or the statistical effect.
Mr President, the three institutions have the responsibility to tackle the negotiations over the coming months with a determination to reach agreement, because we cannot, and must not, allow any further failure.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my contribution to this joint debate on structural and cohesion policy with thanks to my colleagues, particularly to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, most especially to Mr Hutchinson, our own shadow rapporteur on the Hatzidakis report, who is prevented from being here today â something that he very much regrets â by the fact that he is acting as an election observer in Burundi.
We in the Committee have worked through hundreds of amendments to find compromises that I regard as constituting very positive input in response to the Commission proposals.
We very much endorse the general approach of simplifying cohesion and structural policy and making them less bureaucratic.
Aspects of importance to our group have been still further emphasised, among them the reinforcement of the partnership principle and of the urban dimension of cohesion and structural policy, involving among other things the possibility of projects to improve the environment through support for the building of social housing; the Committee also agreed that private-public partnerships should also be an option and decided on a joint approach to the situation of regions affected by the statistical effect.
The Committee as a whole saw it as important that we should, in a spirit of solidarity, make policy for people in the poorest and most disadvantaged of the regions in an enlarged European Union.
Our group found the issue of the reimbursement of VAT by the Regional Funds a difficult one to discuss.
While most of our group take the view that European structural policy should be used for investment in the regions and not to reimburse the public purse, we are aware of the problems faced by municipalities, especially in the new Member States, and so we have proposed a compromise amendment to the Hatzidakis report, which is intended to make it possible to resolve the problems in these Member States.
I would be very glad if the majority in this House were to support this compromise amendment and urge them to do just that.
Last but not least, though, I would urge the Presidency of the Council to adopt the Financial Perspective with the minimum possible delay and to allocate sufficient funding to what I regard as the most successful of the European Unionâs policies.
Even the best regulations are no use without the funds they need.
I would ask you, Mr Michael, to carry to Mr Blair the message that, in your country too, there are outstanding examples of the good that European structural policy can do, and we want them to continue to operate even after 1Â January 2007.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, like my fellow Members, I want, first of all, in my own name and on behalf of my colleagues in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to congratulate and thank the rapporteurs who have done an excellent job.
They have worked with characteristic determination, but it was their flexibility and ability to listen that made it possible to reach something of a general consensus.
As coordinator of the ALDE Group, I should like to stress four points.
Firstly, the general architecture of these Structural Funds is such that they are mutually complementary and consistent with one another, something which should be emphasised in the communication to our populations.
These Structural Funds are not something abstract.
They are Funds that help to improve the conditions of daily life for our fellow citizens.
A specific communication in these terms should therefore be planned.
On this first practical point, I should like to say something about solidarity, as a number of fellow Members have done.
These are not just words.
The European Union, on this specific issue, is not just all about fine words, it is about figures â and they are extremely eloquent ones, because around 80% of the Structural Funds, in accordance with the budgetary guidelines, will be devoted to the objective of convergence.
You have said, MrÂ Michael, that the Structural Funds were currently the European Union's second largest item of expenditure after the common agricultural policy.
In future years, they are likely to become the largest item of expenditure.
As regards solidarity, I should like to stress that the 25 Member States have all decided together â and Parliament will confirm this â that we are going to devote over 80% of the funds from this leading item of Parliamentâs budget to solidarity with the ten new Member States.
This is tangible and concrete proof, in coin of the realm, of our solidarity with the new Member States, which have great need of it and which, I hope, will receive an allocation of considerably more that EUR 300 billion.
Finally, to conclude on a note of hope â but a hope that will certainly be fulfilled â I have no doubt whatsoever that the success we have seen in Ireland, Spain and Portugal will be achieved in the ten new Member States that will benefit from these Funds.
But beyond the Funds themselves, I should also, and above all, stress the use made of them.
It is one thing to have a franc, euro, dollar or schilling.
Actual use has to be made of this money.
I do not have the time to develop this point further, but please allow me to emphasise, in relation to the potential of the Funds, the need to ensure that Member States are aware of all the opportunities we offer, and which are available, for guaranteeing that the Funds are used properly.
To conclude, I should like to direct a remark to you in particular, Mr Michael, as representative of the Presidency, and say, once again quoting a figure that I believe speaks volumes, that if we do not reach agreement on the financial perspectives this autumn, in 2007 the ten new Member States will only receive some EUR 9 billion, whereas with a 2007-2013 policy, a policy of solidarity through the use of the Structural Funds, they will receive EUR 22 billion.
These two figures perfectly illustrate the absolute need to implement these financial perspectives without delay.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by expressing my respect and gratitude to all the rapporteurs, particularly, though, to Mr Andria for his open-mindedness during the discussions on the substance of his report on the Cohesion Fund while we were working together on it.
He had the same attitude to the Commission proposal which served as the basis for our work.
Our group has, for a long time, been campaigning for the Cohesion Fund to be covered by the general directives on the Structural Fund, which would make not only for EU funds to be spent in a more targeted way, for more transparency and greater efficiency, but also for the regions to have more rights to be consulted when identifying programmes and projects, thus putting the partnership principle into practice.
All these courses of action we unreservedly endorse, as well as the Commissionâs proposal that a new priority be added to the Cohesion Fund.
It is evident that there is also broad support in Parliament for energy efficiency projects, and I would also urge its support for the few additional amendments that we have tabled.
We want funds to be allocated equally to the environment and the transport infrastructure, the intention being that Europe should, at long last, give equal support to all modes of transport and that the unfair preference given to roadbuilding projects should cease.
I am sure that those among you who have already tried to travel from Brussels to Strasbourg by train will support what we are trying to do.
I will conclude by wishing both the British Presidency and the previous speakers good luck, in the hope that we will soon have adopted a budget, and will not be irresponsibly endangering the maintenance of the Structural Fundsâ programmes.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the existence of a properly funded and proactive European regional policy is an essential prerequisite for the EU to be able to foster economic and social cohesion and to address increasing economic and social disparities.
The Structural and Cohesion Funds are a vital tool, and indeed the only tool in the Community budget geared towards redistribution.
These Funds enable the EU to take action to reduce regional disparities, to promote real convergence, to stimulate sustainable development, growth, production and jobs in the regions, and to redistribute and offset the costs of the internal market in the least-developed regions.
Accordingly, one of the crucial issues is the financial envelope, with regard to both the amount involved and the way in which it is distributed.
As far as we are concerned, the figure of 0.41% of EU gross national income is woefully inadequate in terms of achieving the proposed objectives and of meeting the cohesion needs of an enlarged EU.
Yet this is the Commissionâs proposal, and that of our very own Parliament in its report on the Financial Perspective.
In limiting themselves to this ceiling, they are undermining the EUâs ability effectively to promote economic and social cohesion and are failing to address such crucial questions as full compensation for regions affected by the statistical effect, Portugalâs Algarve region being one such region; adequate financing of the transition mechanisms, including the Cohesion Fund; and the adequate financing of the outermost regions.
As such, the signatory countries to the so-called âLetter of the Sixâ, whose aim is to restrict the Community budget to 1% of EU gross national income, have got their way.
The recent European Councilâs failure to reach agreement on the Financial Perspective 2007-2013 is, however one looks at it, a victory for the âLetter of the Sixâ signatory countries.
The Luxembourg Presidency had proposed a compromise reduction in the Structural Funds envelope of over EURÂ 30Â billion for the period in question, which translates into 0.37% of EU gross domestic product.
The reports before us also fail to address implementation needs, with regard to pre-financing and cofinancing amounts, and to the issue of pegging the Cohesion Fund to the Stability and Growth Pact.
Unfortunately, a new mindset for the Structural Funds and for their adaptation to the financing of the Lisbon Strategy has become prevalent.
Such is the case of the European Social Fund, which plays second fiddle to the European Employment Strategy.
We are therefore opposed to the emphasis placed on competitiveness, competition, adaptability and entrepreneurial spirit, at the expense of cohesion and convergence.
Against this backdrop, we have tabled proposals for amendments to the reports before us with a view to addressing these key concerns and to stepping up European social cohesion.
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â The debate on the Hatzidakis report is taking place at a time when the EU is mired in a profound crisis, which was triggered by irresponsible attempts to force the European Constitution on the Member States.
The Constitution is a dead duck, and we have it to thank for the fact that age-old animosities have flared between Member States, and for the fact that they are not even able to agree on the 2007-2013 budget.
Despite this heated atmosphere, however, we regret to say that the Hatzidakis report divides the EU once again into two blocs, namely the old Member States and the new Member States.
For understandable reasons, the old Member States are finding very creative ways to limit the funding that was intended to accelerate development in the new Member States.
The report tells us that those living in the 15Â old Member States are best off, and that if they also live on islands, or even better in outermost regions â and particularly if they are inhabitants of regions affected by the statistical effect â then they have nothing to worry about.
Due to short-sighted considerations, frequently motivated by pre-election nerves, the report fails to mention that by far the greatest problem facing the unified Europe is how to overcome the effects of half a century of non-market developments in the post-communist Member States.
In order to make it even more difficult for the inexperienced new Member States to obtain funding, the report rules out a more flexible application of the n+2 rule for the Structural Funds, and provides no solution to the problem of VAT and EU cofinanced projects.
The report is also a slap in the face for any right-thinking entrepreneur who wishes to move production to another Member State where he can find qualified, cheap and industrious workers.
On the one hand, we do not allow the infamous Polish plumber to work on the other side of the former Iron Curtain, because he might prove that it is possible to work a 40-hour week.
On the other hand, however, we impose a senseless obligation on entrepreneurs to remain in regions of the EU where the workforce is excessively expensive, and often accustomed to working a 35-hour week for full wages.
We are preventing entrepreneurs from going in search of Polish plumbers, merely because they once profited from the Structural Funds.
They were unaware at the time that one day we would hold them hostage for having done so; according to one proposal, they would not be set free for 10Â years, which is quite absurd.
Perhaps they should have thought twice before accepting the payout.
This is the perfect antithesis of the Lisbon goals, but maybe it fits in with the Gothenburg strategy.
The Hatzidakis report does however highlight another of the EUâs problems, albeit unintentionally.
It shows contemptuous disregard for public will by repeatedly referring to the Constitution for Europe, which was categorically rejected and buried by the people of France and the Netherlands, and thus demonstrates the same spirit of elitism that plunged the EU into this far-reaching crisis.
For this reason alone, it is hard to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to extend my sincere thanks to all the authors of the reports under discussion.
This debate on the future of the cohesion policy is an important test of the practical application of one of the fundamental values the EU professes to hold, namely solidarity with a view to achieving equal opportunities.
I would remind the House that the aim of the cohesion policy is to support the restructuring and modernisation of those countries that need assistance in order to have any chance of rapidly catching up to the average level of economic development in the European Union.
At present this relates above all to the new Member States.
From their point of view, the application of the n+2 rule and the classing of VAT as an eligible expense should without a doubt be considered the most important of all the issues we are discussing today.
The nature of projects financed under the Cohesion Fund means that preparation alone takes longer than two years.
They are often enormous investment projects, which go beyond the normal time frame of projects financed under the Structural Funds.
Extending the application of the n+2 rule would doubtless mean a drop in the level of funding granted.
As far as VAT is concerned, the experiences of the new Member States are incontrovertible proof that the main barrier to the use of the Structural Funds is the relatively high cost of launching projects.
This cost is covered out of the beneficiariesâ own resources.
Excluding VAT from the list of eligible expenses would result in many entities, including local authorities, being unable to afford the enormous costs associated with implementing projects.
For example, preliminary estimates indicate that the Member States may have to contribute almost 63% of the sum contributed by the EU for the implementation of projects under the European Regional Development Fund.
This would put the new Member States in a position that is considerably worse than that of the Member States that previously benefited from the Structural Funds.
I would remind the Members from the old Member States that we should seize this opportunity for solidarity, and give Europe a chance to develop.
This would also be in the interests of the old Member States.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, in listening to the debate so far I have been struck by the fact that we clearly all agree on one point, namely that the aim of cohesion policy is to ensure the balanced development of all the regions in the individual Member States.
As such, it complies with the principle of solidarity, which is one of the founding pillars of the European Union.
In my opinion, if we are to continue adhering to this principle following the recent enlargement, when 10Â new Member States joined the EU, it is imperative that we adopt two key proposed amendments during tomorrowâs vote on the Structural Funds.
Firstly, we should agree to the funding of non-recoverable VAT under the Structural Funds, and in particular under the European Regional Development Fund.
Classing non-recoverable VAT as non-eligible expenditure would make it a great deal more difficult for many recipients to obtain funding.
My fear is that it might become entirely impossible to gain access to EU funding, in particular in the case of smaller applicants from the 10 new and less wealthy Member States.
Secondly, we should remove the automatic decommitment rule, or in other words the n+2 rule, from the guidelines for implementation of the Cohesion Fund, or at the very least provide for greater flexibility during the first few years of the programming period.
Major investment projects in the environment and transport sectors are financed under the Cohesion Fund, and rigorous application of the n+2 rule would pose a serious threat to this financing.
Once again, this is particularly true in the case of the 10Â new Member States, which still lack experience in implementing the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group endorses the idea contained in the Fava report that the ERDF should concentrate on investments, infrastructures and further development initiatives in selected areas that are a priority for the Community, as it continues to be the case that the whole Community can expect to derive considerable additional benefit from investments of this kind.
In essence, the report, as adopted by the Committee, adds muscle to those of the Regulationâs provisions that deal with scope, aid and the rules for eligibility of expenditure.
Generally, albeit not entirely or in every single detail, the way the Committee voted reflects the position taken by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and we agree with the Commission and with Mr Fava, the rapporteur, on the substance of the three objectives, these being convergence, regional competitiveness and employment, as well as European territorial cooperation.
We also endorse the proposal for the proportionate distribution of financial resources.
The emphasis on the regions most likely to benefit from support, albeit not to the detriment of those affected by the statistical effect, is the logical consequence of Article 160 of the European Communities Treaty.
There are two points to which I should like to draw particular attention, the first being the continuing need for the option of public-private partnerships to be open, which would mean the cofinancing rate being calculated also by reference to private resources.
There is in fact no reason why the Commission should not agree to this.
My second point is that, if we fail to reach agreement in due time, in the context of the Financial Perspective, on the amount of funds to be made available, the regions most deserving of support would, in accordance with the treatyâs requirement for cohesion, have to receive special treatment.
What that means is that under no circumstances must any cuts be merely linear, for this would definitely be to the detriment of the convergence regions and would run counter to the European cohesion policy guidelines.
Perhaps, though, the British Presidency will manage to fit structural policy into the Budget in such a way that no cuts would be possible.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by echoing the congratulations for the various rapporteurs, and in particular Mr Andria, for his work on the report on the Cohesion Fund and his willingness to engage in the dialogue that has allowed us to reach a consensus on the majority of that reportâs content.
We in the Socialist Group believe that this instrument is essential to achieving the objectives of social, economic and territorial cohesion.
The incorporation of actions in the field of sustainable development, transport and the environment make this fund consistent with European cohesion policy.
There are issues, such as the application of the N+2 rule, that require formulae that can be applied more flexibly, so that its implementation does not create problems, particularly for the new Member States.
We must emphasise the explicit reference in this report to disabled people, incorporating the importance of these funds contributing to the removal of architectural obstacles.
The achievements resulting from this instrument have allowed countries such as Spain to reach acceptable levels of development; a sudden and immediate loss would therefore jeopardise that development very significantly.
I am therefore pleased that the need to seek a political solution for those countries which will be excluded in the future has been recognised.
With regard to the other regulations, we must take account of the existence of other realities which do not exclusively relate to the least-favoured regions, but also the regions suffering from the statistical effect, the natural effect, the outermost regions and regions with low population densities.
The reality of Europe is plural, it is diverse, and we must take account of the differing realities.
A resolute and successful policy in this field must take account of the different realities and not forget that behind them the European citizens are awaiting a response.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, MrÂ Hatzidakis, for his excellent levels of cooperation in the debate on the report on the general Regulation.
We achieved a satisfactory compromise on the committee.
It takes impartial account of the interests and views of both the new and old Member States.
I hope that it will also be adopted more or less as it is in tomorrowâs vote.
When we make reforms to EU policies we have to adhere to sustainable principles.
The aim of regional policy should be to tackle disparities regarding employment and livelihood, on the one hand, and to control harmful migration both within and between Member States, on the other.
MrÂ Hatzidakisâs report follows these principles.
There have been pressures to violate these principles in the debate on the reform.
Here in Parliament there have been calls to switch the main focus of aid on the cities, as it is in cities that 80% of the citizens of the Union live.
There is no good argument for this.
In a market economy, reserves and the population tend too much to be concentrated mainly in the largest cities.
In regional policy this development should not be endorsed.
There are particular problems in the major cities, but they should not be solved using regional policy appropriations or the Unionâs budget in general.
There are good grounds, however, for many small and medium-sized cities to receive regional aid, especially if it is a component of broader-scope regional development programmes.
Aspects of regional policy should also be taken into account in any reform of the common agricultural policy.
The present system is absurd, as the largest amounts of aid are paid in those regions where the conditions for production are most favourable.
It is very important for the implementation of regional policy that the Council should achieve consensus on the financial perspective and legislation on regional policy in the months to come.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to add my voice of congratulations to our five rapporteurs for their cooperative, constructive approach in the compilation of their reports.
I cannot help but contrast that with the uncooperative, destructive approach of the United Kingdom Government.
To be fair, I was pleased to hear Mr Michaelâs speech mentioning partnership so often, but like so much with the London Labour Government, warm words will cut no ice with us unless we see some action as well.
The fact is the UK position right now would see the Highlands and Islands, the West, the East and the South of Scotland lose out on millions upon millions of much needed EU funding that the Commission and this House want us to receive.
If that is the UK definition of partnership, this House has comprehensively rejected it.
Therefore, I will be backing all five of the reports with a few amendments to strengthen in particular statistical effect and the partnership principle.
I urge colleagues to unite strongly around these reports, so that the European version of partnership â rather than the British version â prevails.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, and I welcome in particular the report by Mr Olbrycht on the establishment of a European grouping on territorial cooperation.
I thank the rapporteur not only for his work but also for the way in which he approached it.
Obstacles in the way of the common delivery of services across borders can often deter public servants and others from undertaking practical cooperation on a cross-border, transnational or interregional basis.
This in turn leads to duplication, waste and lost opportunities.
The Commission proposal and the amendments made or coordinated by Mr Olbrycht will benefit my country, which has been divided by a north-south border, but it will also benefit all who wish to work more fully with their European neighbours.
Mr Olbrycht has moved to deal with concerns about financial control, existing cooperation arrangements and partnerships that include NGOs and local authorities.
I particularly welcome the recognition that such groupings have a role to play in fostering reconciliation across borders where there has been civil or military conflict.
I also commend the report on European regional development by Mr Fava and I want to acknowledge MrÂ FavaÂŽs willingness to listen to Committee colleagues and take on board a number of compromise amendments.
I am particularly pleased with the report's emphasis on social inclusion and sustainable development.
We can all support the commitment to remove obstacles to access for people with disabilities and the commitment to non-discrimination and equal opportunities.
Structural funding has helped reshape the economic infrastructure of Ireland.
We will be keen in future to see the investment available, in the north and south of Ireland, targeted at the most disadvantaged areas, including rural communities along the border between the north and south of the island, communities that have suffered as a result of partition and conflict.
In this respect, I also welcome the inclusion by Mr Hatzidakis of compromise amendments dealing with the specific challenges faced by the natural effect regions in Ireland and elsewhere.
Programmes should have a bottom-up approach, where local communities have a say in the design and implementation of projects, and we welcome amendments that strengthen the contribution to the social economy.
However, my party and I do not favour the use of public-private partnerships.
On a broader level, the EU faces a considerable challenge in ensuring that both established and newer Member States receive consistent levels of ERDF funding on the basis of need.
Like my colleagues, I also hope that the necessary budget for all this can be agreed this year so that the next cycle can start promptly.
Â Â  Mr President, cohesion policy has been at the heart of the European project from the outset and it is a policy dependent upon the concept of regions at the expense of nations.
