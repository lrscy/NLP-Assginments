At the centre of Mr De Rossaâs report is a stand-off between the Commission and the Council over the exportability of five benefits, three from the United Kingdom.
MrÂ De Rossa suggests that the report should be adopted without delay, so that RegulationÂ 1408/71 can be tidied up.
Then he proposes that the European Court of Justice resolve the dispute over the five benefits.
We believe that the decision on the United Kingdom benefit should be left to Her Majestyâs Government, which does not want them to be exportable.
Indeed, the Councilâs previously stated common position upholds that of Her Majestyâs Government.
We therefore deplore the Commissionâs change of mind.
We believe that it should be for each Member State to define the basis on which its benefits are to be paid and to whom.
We absolutely oppose the notion that the deadlock should be resolved by the European Court of Justice.
Benefits are part of taxation systems.
They are dual systems: taking from and giving back.
To interfere in either is to interfere in the taxation system as a whole.
Since the EU likes to keep up the pretence that it has no competence for issues of taxation, it should not therefore interfere at all in the benefits system.
To return, finally, to Mr De Rossaâs article, it is noted that Finland and Sweden also contest the listing of two allowances.
We respect their stance.
The article shows that the Commission has exempted the Irish carersâ allowance, as the Irish Government wished.
It is wrong and iniquitous that the United Kingdom carersâ allowance has not been exempted.
As regards the three United Kingdom benefits, let me say unequivocally that Her Majestyâs elected government should be treated like its Irish counterparts in that respect and that should be the end of the matter.
Â Â  Social security is a value which we espouse in the Member States of the European Union.
It is a matter of even greater importance to all those who are incapacitated as a result of disability, sickness or old age.
Increased mobility within the countries of the European Union has been accompanied by an increasing number of problems, which must be resolved in as non-discriminatory a manner as possible.
For this reason social security systems in the Member States of the European Union must be harmonised so that all cases can receive equal treatment.
I support the proposal of rapporteur De Rossa and I will be voting for the report.
In the present situation it is more beneficial to support the amendment to Regulation 1408 and, within this framework, to Annex 2A, rather than continuing with fruitless negotiations, since adopting a joint position has involved the Council in protracted negotiations.
Time will tell which cases cannot be included in the list of supplements, so I therefore suggest that such cases be resolved individually, impartially and in peopleâs interests.
I am pleased that the Council has adopted the proposal of Parliament on the mobility supplement, which covers travel expenses for people with disability, and which is exclusively aimed at providing special protection for people with disability.
I also welcome the oral amendments adopted by Parliament, whereby Member States should adopt measures which will help to mitigate any unwelcome consequences for those people who will be most affected by the regulation.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commission welcomes the support expressed for the common position.
I want to emphasise once again that this common position seeks to improve in several respects the rights of European citizens moving within the European Union.
May I say that European citizens are really fortunate to be able to move within the Union in this way while being assured in a number of cases of the solidarity they need.
That is a real step forward.
Under these circumstances of course â Mrs Oomen-Ruijten will take no offence â the Commission does not support her amendment rejecting the common position because that amendment would jeopardise all the progress made by the Community legislator up until now in the matter of special non-contributory benefits.
The proposal in question will result in dozens of benefits that have not been exportable up until now being exportable.
There are however still five benefits at issue that have not been accepted as having to be exportable.
The effect of Amendment 2 will be that all those benefits will remain in Annex IIa and will therefore continue to be non-exportable.
I honestly believe that, even if the fate of those five benefits is still uncertain, the agreement reached in the Council and the support, which I believed to be quite broad, in Parliament should enable us to make significant social progress for all European citizens where the remainder of the benefits is concerned.
That is why the Commission is keen to see this text adopted.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â I declare the 2004/2005 session of the European Parliament closed.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament 2005-2006 open.
Â Â  The sitting is open.
Â Â  I would like to welcome Mr Solomon Passy, Bulgarian Foreign Affairs Minister, who is visiting Parliament today and who is in the official gallery.
This visit, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, represents an important step in the process of accession and in strengthening the links between Bulgaria and the European Parliament.
We are all aware that on 13 April we will give our opinion here, in Strasbourg, on Bulgaria's accession.
If Parliament expresses a favourable opinion, and if the accession treaty is signed on 25 April in Luxembourg, as scheduled, we will have the great pleasure of receiving amongst us, firstly, the Bulgarian observers, and then the Members who will sit in this House.
Minister, I wish you a happy stay in the European Parliament.
Â Â  Today, ladies and gentlemen, we are celebrating International Womenâs Day.
We have been doing so for more than 90 years, but, despite this celebration, every day millions of women throughout the world still suffer discrimination on the grounds of gender and abuse of all kinds, both in times of peace and in times of war.
They are still the victims of physical, psychological, sexual and economic violence, violence which sometimes comes from within their closest family environment.
Just a few days ago we saw horrific images of Turkish riot police putting down a demonstration of women ahead of todayâs Womenâs Day.
I had the opportunity to condemn these actions yesterday in plenary.
I have asked the Turkish Government to punish the perpetrators of these indescribable actions and I would like to point out that they do not, of course, send the best possible message in terms of Turkeyâs possible accession.
Ladies and gentlemen, at the moment and until 11Â March, the United Nations are hosting a World Conference on gender equality to review the progress made since the Beijing Conference of 1995, ten years ago now.
As you know, a Delegation from our Parliament is participating very actively in this Conference, as was also the case in 1995.
There is no question that progress has been made since then.
Kofi Annan acknowledged this in his speech at the opening of the BeijingÂ +Â 10 Conference, but there are still enormous problems, immense challenges, which must not be considered without proposing solutions, just as we must not treat today as simply a symbolic day which merely serves to satisfy our guilty conscience.
This afternoon we will hold a debate on âCultural and domestic violenceâ involving specialised media and personalities.
I would like to invite all of you to this seminar/debate, and when I say everybody, I mean everybody, men and women, because when we hold these events relating to the problems of women, we men are usually conspicuous by our absence.
We must be aware that the problem of gender equality is not just a problem for women, it is a problem for both women and for society as a whole, and we men must be more involved in the task of resolving it.
Today in Europe, one in every five women claim to have been victims of abuse, one in every five.
And unfortunately this proportion is increasing in many countries.
In the rich, democratic, developed and cohesive European Union, poverty is becoming increasingly feminised.
There are worrying signs of a feminisation of poverty.
Women today still receive, on average, 16% less pay than their male colleagues for the same work.
This point must also be dealt with within the Lisbon Strategy, which does not offer very positive figures in this regard either.
For this reason, during this term in office, we have introduced into each parliamentary committee a Member responsible for monitoring gender issues, which cannot be dealt with in an isolated fashion, in a kind of conceptual ghetto, but which must affect all policies horizontally.
This term in office will also be marked by the ratification of the Constitution, which includes, very rightly, gender equality amongst the Unionâs objectives and values.
But we must go beyond texts and words and be aware that equality will not become a reality until the mindset of men changes radically, overcoming an anthropological heritage that is sometimes deeply ingrained in our customs and consciences, until employers start offering equal salaries, until specific advantages are offered with a view to helping women to carry out their professional activities and to prevent or compensate for the disadvantages they have to face in their professional careers as a result of fulfilling a role that only they can play, human reproduction.
We will not resolve Europeâs demographic problems unless we resolve the problems of equality for women.
When the day comes when all the Member States apply the Declaration relating to Article III-116 of the Constitution and adopt the necessary measures to punish criminal acts, because we are talking about criminal violence against women, we will have taken a great step forward.
I would like there to be complete gender parity in this Parliament.
But I would like this to come about, not because a rule imposes it, but because the equal distribution of capacities between men and women is reflected in our social and political practices.
Neither should we believe that the best yardstick for measuring equality between men and women is the percentage of women members of the parliaments of the different countries.
Inequality manifests itself in the cruellest and hardest way in the lowest strata of society, where a combination of dreadful working conditions and family burdens makes life hardest for women.
I would therefore like once again to invite you to take part in the events that are going to be held today in the European Parliament, which is participating in todayâs celebration with the greatest of enthusiasm.
The next item is the debate on the oral questions to the Council (B6-0015/2005) and to the Commission (B6-0016/2005) on the follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women â Platform for Action (Beijing + 10).
Â Â  â Mr President, today being International Womenâs Day, it is an important opportunity to draw attention to the fact that women around the world are insufficiently involved in decision-making.
I am glad that the Commission, too, will now be joining in our debate, as the questions raised will focus on how the evaluation of the platform for action at Beijing ten years ago has developed as our most important foundation for measures in connection with womenâs rights around the world.
As I speak, the UN is in session in New York, assessing the outcomes of the Platform for Action, and in this the European Union has a very important part to play.
As a rapporteur in Beijing, I did of course follow closely what the European Union was doing and the action it was taking; I did so again five years later at âBeijing + 5â in New York, and now, with a delegation from the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, I am doing the same with âBeijing + 10â.
We see it as an important step, and one on which I congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency, to use good and adroit negotiation as a means of defending womenâs rights there.
The United States of America has pushed hard for the platform for action to be renegotiated in order to spark renewed controversy and gain renewed influence, particularly in matters affecting twelve critical areas â prime among them being reproductive and sexual rights, which, in practical terms, means abortion.
The negotiating skills of the Luxembourg Presidency, among others, made it possible to prevent this, but I find it regrettable that the Commission did not put on much of a show in New York, being represented only by one Commissioner, or, perhaps on one occasion, by Mr Barroso.
The questions that we are putting today to the Commission and the Council in those twelve different areas must serve to evaluate progress and, of course, also to highlight the deficiencies in these areas that have yet to be made good.
Here in the EU, we have had one report from each Member State; the Luxembourg Presidency has held a conference to collate them and to undertake an assessment.
Progress has certainly been made.
Where political participation is concerned, we have been successful in raising consciousness.
In some countries, there have been breakthroughs; in your country, Mr President, that being Spain, the government is establishing parity between men and women.
In the last elections to the European Parliament, we did not experience the invasion we had dreaded and expected after the ten new Member States sent observers of whom only 14% were women.
Here, then, things really have been moving.
European countries have performed very well in the Inter-Parliamentary Unionâs assessment of participation in governments, even though womenâs participation stands at only 10% in France and Italy.
For that reason, women, and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, are still calling for quotas, which are necessary if women are to have a share in political decision-making processes.
To that our European anti-discrimination policy has given a great deal of impetus, even though its implementation in the Member States still leaves much to be desired.
Our various actions against violence, such as the Daphne and STOP programmes, have highlighted the need for violence to be curtailed.
We have afforded ample consideration to trafficking in women, thereby making it clear that we cannot accept a situation in which up to 500Â 000 women are smuggled into the European Union in order to be sexually exploited.
We find it completely unacceptable that practically one woman in five in Europe should be at least once in her life, the victim of some form of violence.
What we want is a Gender Institute to underpin our work and supply us with statistical data to help combat various forms of discrimination in even more practical and tangible ways.
Alongside the integration of women in the labour market, the encouragement of women in time-tested ways, and gender mainstreaming as a framework policy, we want an equal opportunities programme.
Something that we certainly want, and on which neither the Commission nor the Council have budged, is a European Year for Combating Violence, which ought to be announced in 2006.
Nothing has happened so far; we do not even have practical proposals as to what form the Gender Institute should now take, and so this is where the Commission and the Council still have a great deal of work to do on implementation.
Goodwill is not enough on its own; what we need is action.
Symbolism is fine on one day â International Womenâs Day; we now have 365 of them, full of work to be done.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to thank those Members who have just launched this debate on the follow-up to the Beijing Platform for Action and its review ten years on.
As you know, this issue is currently under consideration at the 49th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.
The Presidency has already delivered a message, a robust one I hope, giving an indication of the Unionâs commitment to seeing the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action implemented properly and in full.
However, since the session is still in progress, I am not yet able to report on its results.
Today, the European Union considers equality between women and men to be a fundamental principle and the rights of women and girls to be an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights.
The âBeijing + 10â review comes at an important time, because it will not only enable the Union to strengthen its programme and its commitment to achieving the objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action, but will also provide an opportunity to identify the areas where progress has been made and those where concerted action needs to be further stepped up.
The report published recently as part of âBeijing + 10â on the progress made within the European Union, which was drafted by the Luxembourg Presidency, sets out clearly the major results achieved by the European Union institutions, as well as the progress made in terms of institutional mechanisms in the Member States.
Nevertheless, in its report, the Presidency also lists the challenges that remain to be addressed, and MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner has just cited several relating to the 12 critical areas of concern identified at the Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held in Beijing in 1995.
As Members have said, it is important to endeavour to ascertain why obstacles still stand in the way of achieving equality between women and men and to find out how they can be overcome.
Allow me also to refer you to the Commissionâs Annual Report on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men in the European Union, which was adopted on 14Â February.
Before addressing more directly the issues raised by Members, I should like briefly to set out some of the positive initiatives taken at European Union level to promote gender equality.
Our work to promote gender equality has been marked by three significant milestones in the last ten years: firstly, the adoption of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which created new competences relating to the principle of gender equality; secondly, the setting up of a European Employment Strategy, which has made equal opportunities an essential priority; and finally, the mainstreaming of gender-equality issues into different policy areas, in particular the process of social inclusion and the Structural Funds, by means of mechanisms such as annual work programmes or national action plans including targeted actions to promote gender equality.
The European Unionâs legislative framework on equal treatment has expanded unremittingly over the years.
The latest development was the adoption, in December of last year, of a Council directive extending the principle of equal treatment beyond the field of employment and professional training for the first time and applying it to public goods and services.
Nevertheless, despite the progress made on establishing equality between women and men, there is a discrepancy between equality in law and equality in real life, and there are significant disparities between women and men in many sectors, as the Presidencyâs report also shows.
Let us now take a look at the critical areas of concern identified in the Beijing Platform for Action to which you referred in your question.
I should like to start with employment.
The good news is that womenâs employment rates have increased at a greater rate than menâs over the last ten years, but the bad news is that the difference between the two is still very high, at 17.2 %, and that the wage gap between men and women remains practically the same.
This is worrying not only for women but also for the European economy as a whole.
If the European Union wishes to achieve the ambitious objectives of the Lisbon strategy, it will have to meet the objective of an employment rate of 60% by 2010.
In accordance with the European Employment Strategy, the Member States have put mechanisms in place for meeting this objective as part of their national action plans.
The Barcelona European Council set a target for the provision of childcare services, the purpose of which was to make it easier for women to enter or return to the paid labour market.
It is also part of the strategy to reconcile work and family life.
Considerable progress has already been made in this respect in many Member States, even though the traditional division of childcare and paid work between women and men persists, and this in spite of the efforts made by certain Member States to implement policies seeking to encourage fathers to take parental leave.
This yearâs draft Joint Employment Report, which will be sent to the Spring European Council, also clearly shows that more concerted action is needed to increase womenâs participation in the labour market, and in particular to address the pay gaps between women and men.
With a view to responding to these concerns, the ministers responsible for gender equality policy in the 25 Member States undertook, in a declaration adopted on 4Â February 2005, to develop strategies to increase the number of women in employment and in quality jobs, to guarantee and protect the rights of women workers and to remove structural, legal and psychological barriers to gender equality at work.
The aim is also to promote policies enabling women and men to strike a balance between their professional and private lives, including their family responsibilities.
The joint indicators identified by the European Union for the area, âWomen and the economyâ, that is the sixth critical area of concern in the Beijing Platform for Action, will make it possible to monitor progress.
The structural indicators developed as part of the European Employment Strategy will also be extremely useful in this process.
Violence against women: despite the considerable progress made in this area since the initial Daphne programme was launched in 1997, unfortunately further measures urgently need to be taken to prevent violence towards women and children and to combat this phenomenon.
We hope that the present Daphne programme, which will be in force until the end of 2008, will remain an essential programming instrument to combat violence.
The projects carried out under this programme over the years have made it possible to create many effective networks and to develop good methodologies.
A number of presidencies have tackled this problem, the most recent initiative being the adoption of indicators drafted by the Dutch Presidency on sexual harassment in the workplace.
In the aforementioned declaration, the ministers of the European Union responsible for gender equality policy agreed to develop preventative methods to combat gender-based violence and trafficking in human beings and to monitor their implementation.
They also decided to intensify actions to prevent and combat all forms of trafficking in women and girls through a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary and coordinated anti-trafficking strategy.
This strategy will include measures to address all of the factors that encourage trafficking, by strengthening existing legislation with a view to providing better protection of the rights of women and girls and to prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators through both criminal and civil measures.
As regards your request to make 2006 the European Year against Violence towards Women, I cannot deny that such an initiative could help to raise public awareness of this issue, but, according to my information, the Commission intends to declare 2006 the âEuropean Year of Mobility for Workersâ.
It has also announced that, as part of its drive to promote diversity and non-discrimination, 2007 will be the âEuropean Year of Equal Opportunitiesâ and it would seem that 2010 is to be declared the âEuropean Year of the Fight against Exclusion and Povertyâ.
You will perhaps be interested to know that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has recommended to the Committee of Ministers that 2006 be declared the âEuropean Year against Domestic Violenceâ as part of a pan-European campaign run in cooperation with the European Commission and the European Parliament, as well as with national associations and NGOs.
Women and poverty: in the ministerial declaration of 4Â February, the Member States also agreed to strengthen efforts to combat social exclusion and to remove obstacles to womenâs participation in the labour market, on the basis that a good job is one of the best ways of escaping poverty.
Although there are not yet any gender-specific indicators at European Union level for the feminisation of poverty, certain structural indicators, broken down by gender and produced as part of the processes of inclusion and social cohesion, are presented each year to the Spring European Council.
It is nevertheless true that a great deal remains to be done and that most of the Member Statesâ national action plans hardly mention questions of gender equality outside the world of work.
The issue of gender-specific indicators could be addressed in the future.
Women and the environment: as regards the measures currently being taken by the European Union to take account of gender in its development cooperation policy, I should like to remind you that last April the European Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation on promoting gender equality in the Communityâs policies, strategies and interventions in development cooperation.
A financial framework of EURÂ 9 million has been agreed for the period 2004 to 2006 for the purpose of implementing this regulation.
This follows the 1998 regulation, which recognised that actions in support of development have rarely taken proper account of the differences between the situations, roles, opportunities and priorities of men and women, and that correcting the inequalities between men and women and strengthening the role of women are vital to achieving social justice and ensuring that our development work is effective.
May I also stress that the regulation was adopted in the context of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations, the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, as well as the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome document of the special session of the General Assembly entitled, âWomen 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first centuryâ.
During the 49th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the Presidency stated, on behalf of the European Union, that it recognised that gender equality and womenâs empowerment were essential for sustainable development and poverty eradication.
Girls: I have already addressed the issue of trafficking, but I should like to add that, in a recent declaration, the European Union ministers responsible for gender equality policy agreed to mainstream a gender perspective into national immigration and asylum policies, regulations and practices, as appropriate in order to promote and protect the rights of all women and girls, including by considering steps to recognise gender-related persecution and violence when assessing grounds for granting refugee status and asylum.
I should also like to stress that in April 2004 the Council adopted a directive seeking to have residence permits issued to third-country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings.
Womenâs rights are human rights: before the Commission on the Status of Women, the Presidency reaffirmed, on behalf of the Member States, its view that full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms is essential to empowering women and girls and to establishing a genuine democracy.
This point of view should continue to prevail when the Council negotiates the forthcoming Commission proposal to establish an Agency on Fundamental Rights.
I should also add that the European Unionâs statement in New York also mentioned the need to eradicate harmful customary or traditional practices, including female genital mutilation, early and forced marriage and crimes committed in the name of honour, which are obstacles to the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Women and armed conflicts: the Council has taken note of the European Parliamentâs resolution recommending that women should constitute at least 40% of the staff of reconciliation, peace-keeping and conflict-prevention operations.
Discussions have indeed been held in the European Union on the importance of having women in peace-keeping forces, and on the need to provide all of those involved with training on the particular problems faced by civilian women in conflict zones.
Nevertheless, in the absence of approved indicators and relevant statistical data on women and armed conflicts, I am unfortunately not able to say whether the 40% quota has been respected or not.
In their declaration of 4Â February, the European Union ministers agreed to implement and encourage initiatives, policies and programmes following the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 concerning women, peace and security, which does not set quotas as such, but does recommend greater female participation.
They also decided to act in accordance with the Council of Europe Declaration, Programme of Action and Resolution on democratisation, conflict prevention and peace-building.
During the first week of the work of the Commission on the Status of Women, the European Union outlined its commitment to promoting the role of women in conflict prevention and resolution, peace-building and democratic processes after conflicts, as well as after natural disasters and during reconstruction.
The European Union also stressed that it is important to ensure that the needs of women in post-disaster relief and reconstruction situations are properly understood and are addressed in programmes, and that it is also important to ensure that women have equal access to information on disaster reduction by means of formal and non-formal education, including through gender-sensitive early-warning systems.
I should now like to conclude by thanking you for allowing me, on this International Womenâs Day, to give voice to the European Unionâs determination to achieve gender equality and its commitment to meeting the objectives set out in the Beijing Platform for Action and the follow-up documents from the 55th Session of the General Assembly in 2000, which have lost none of their relevance today.
I am convinced that the European Parliament and the Commission will continue to work towards these same objectives and that by also involving civil society and the NGOs as far as possible, we will be able to take other measures to promote equality.
Finally, I could not finish without telling you how pleased I am to see that today the Commission is going to table its proposal on the European Institute for Gender Equality, as it was invited to do by the European Council in June 2004.
Such an institute will provide the means and the robust structure necessary to find a response at European level to issues such as the pay gap between men and women, increased access for women to the labour market, their participation in decision-making and the balance between work and family life.
Â Â  , Madam Chairman, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I am pleased to have this opportunity of discussing with you, on a day we commemorate as International Womenâs Day, the implementation of the Beijing Platform and the results that have been achieved.
The celebration of this tenth anniversary is also a significant opportunity for the European Union to continue the remaining tasks.
First, I would like to thank MrsÂ GrÃ¶ner and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities for this extensive and complex question.
Thanks to the support of your committee, we have made, and continue to make, considerable progress in reconfirming the obligations of the Beijing Platform.
I am pleased that the United Nations has reached an agreement on a political declaration in this context; it is no coincidence that the European Union has made a significant contribution to this decision.
I would like to thank the Luxembourg Presidency, because this issue has not been easy; it has taken a lot of effort and has required the force of a united Europe.
The European Commission played an active role in the coordination of positions for the preparation and continuation of the Beijing Platform for Action within the United Nations.
The conference held by the Luxembourg Presidency on 2 and 3 February on the theme of âBeijing + 10â presented a report on the implementation of twelve areas of the Beijing Platform for Action in the European Union, and also highlighted the shortcomings and tasks which need to be resolved.
The report is based on indicators on which the Member States agreed.
Your first question concerns two central problems.
One is the participation of women in the labour market, and I would like to stress that efforts to eliminate the inequality between men and women are and will remain a fundamental prerequisite in achieving the Lisbon objectives.
It is true that the disparities in the salaries and wages of women and men are very great and remain too great.
The Commission will strive to ensure that European legal regulations in the field of the equality of remuneration are applied.
Within the framework of the European Employment Strategy, it will make recommendations to Member States where the differences are relatively large.
It is also necessary to underline the fact that the role of the social partners in this field is important and, in some respects, crucial.
One of the European Unionâs tasks that still needs to be resolved is the difficult reconciliation of family and working life.
Therefore, in its new social agenda, the Commission proposed a communication on future developments in policies concerning the equality of women and men.
Reconciliation remains the central issue here.
I would also like to mention the fact that, in this respect, the review of the Working Time Directive will be highly significant.
In the programme for the equality of women and men, projects and conferences have been funded within the framework of the Presidency, and we are now analysing the results.
It is important to continue presenting initiatives intended to increase awareness in this field.
We must also have the necessary data at our fingertips.
Therefore the Commission has set up a database on women and men involved in the socio-economic and political decision-making process, which is available on the website of the Directorate-General for Employment.
Ten years after Beijing, women remain, unfortunately, the victims of the dramatic phenomenon of trafficking in women.
The Commission is currently preparing a communication on trafficking in human beings, in order to present possibilities for an improvement in EU policy against this crime.
The Commission plans to publish this communication by the end of the first half of the year.
I am well acquainted with your proposal of a European Year Against Violence Against Women.
The Commission considers the fight against violence against women to be a matter of paramount importance, and has studied the request from the European Parliament that 2006 be declared the European Year against this form of violence.
However, the Commission notes that 2004 was the subject of a global campaign by Amnesty International on the same theme, and therefore, while there is no doubt about the significance of the initiative brought up by Parliament, the Commission is reserved as regards the opportunity of proposing this event at a European level as early as 2006 when it took place on a global level in 2004.
It is also important for gender issues to be incorporated into policies related to health.
This is happening at European level via the public health programme, out of which projects for the development of strategies and for the appointment of best practice have been financed (for example, in the field of birth control among adolescent girls, family planning, and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases).
Special attention is paid to HIV prevention in relation to mothers and children.
Efforts in the field of education should continue to prevent a situation where segregation begins at school and is carried through into the world of work.
On several occasions, the European Council and the Commission have highlighted the lesser participation of girls in subjects connected with the natural sciences and in technical subjects.
Therefore it is important for the Council for Education to set itself the target of increasing the number of graduates of mathematical, scientific, and technical subjects by 15% by 2010 and of reducing the imbalance between men and women.
The mainstay of the European Unionâs policy for audiovisual media is Directive 97/36/EC, Television without Frontiers.
Within the framework of the review of this Directive in 2005, the Commission will present a proposal that takes account of the rules related to human dignity, especially rules against discrimination.
Another important instrument in the field of the media is the recent proposal of a recommendation concerning the protection of minors and human dignity and the right to reply, with regard to competitiveness in the audiovisual sphere and the European industry of information services.
It is important for media operators to assume greater responsibility for excluding discrimination from the content of the work they produce.
In our conditions of developmental assistance, we propose a strategy for the equality of women and men as a goal in itself, and we acknowledge the leading role of equality in developmental policies as we seek to reduce poverty and improve government, and in human rights.
Modern society, which is based on creativity, on the ability to tap the human potential of all its members, is not capable of holding its ground if it does not make full use of the potential offered by women.
I think that this is one of the fundamental reasons for poverty in some parts of the world.
In the summary report on progress made by the Union and its Member States in achieving the millennium development targets, the cooperation between the platform and the millennium targets is taken into consideration.
I would like to stress that womenâs rights are fundamental human rights; the issue of the equality of men and women in the European Union goes beyond the framework of respecting a fundamental right.
It is a special Community policy, a priority, a well-established policy established in treaties and agreements which can draw on a solid base of legal regulations.
As you know, the Commission is preparing a proposal for an expansion in the responsibilities of the monitoring centre in Vienna to include the protection of fundamental rights, and although it is too early to express an opinion on the activities of the future agency, this agency will clearly handle the protection of the fundamental rights of both men and women.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the previous speech it was mentioned that today the Commission will discuss the proposal to set up an institute for equal opportunities between men and women, a gender institute, and I am pleased that we have made progress in this issue.
I think it will be a step that will reinforce the policies of equal opportunities, that will result in something I hold in high importance â a solid base, and I believe it will give us more room to take action armed with knowledge and free of prejudices.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Jacobs, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this year the international day of 8 March sees the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the World Conference on Women, but do the worldâs women today all view the progress announced in Beijing in the same way?
BeijingÂ + 10 is a new departure today and I am especially grateful to those of you who helped to table this oral question.
Today my thoughts are with all those women who have devoted their lives to defending the dignity of women by winning fundamental social, economic and political rights.
Their commitment was sometimes seen as an act of transgression, a sign of a lack of femininity or even a display of exhibitionism.
True equality of human rights, equal pay for equal work, protection for working mothers, fair career advancement and the equality of spouses in family life are matters of urgency.
The social presence of women calls into question a society based on efficiency and productivity alone.
Abuses against women must be strongly condemned as a matter of urgency, women and girls defended against all forms of violence that turn them into objects or commodities.
In such conditions, before being the responsibility of women, the choice of abortion is the responsibility of the man, with the complicity of the environment in which they live.
Being a woman and being a mother should not entail any discrimination or penalisation because the survival of humanity depends on it.
A woman who is able to express her creative genius becomes truly revolutionary because she knows how to resolve conflicts, to make and restore peace.
Peace is not only the absence of war; it is a state of justice, a matter of urgency that affects us all, men and women, today.
Let us women therefore wish ourselves a happy anniversary!
Â Â  â Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was also fortunate enough to be part of Parliamentâs delegation to the Fourth World Conference on the Beijing Platform and I should like to congratulate the Luxembourg Presidency on the firm and correct stance that it has taken.
The United Nations Secretary-General gave warning that 201Â million women are still without access to contraception and pointed out that one third of deaths during pregnancy and childbirth are caused by a lack of reproductive and sexual health services.
Furthermore, new types of discrimination have come to light.
When a woman has to choose between breast-feeding her child and keeping her job in management; when a woman has to choose between looking after her sick children and the risk of being sacked; when a woman finds that the people at work are more understanding if she asks to leave early in order to take the car in for a service than in order to pick up her child at the kindergarten; all of this tells you everything about the mentality of those who hold economic power and about the undervaluation of jobs traditionally allocated to women.
I welcome the good intentions expressed here, by both the Council and the Commission, but I should like to see those words translated into action and should like to hear what practical measures the Commission and the Council are going to take to remedy this state of affairs, and I am not talking here about the situation of women in poor countries, of Muslim women, of women in a poor country in Africa or Asia at the mercy of a corrupt despot or of fanatical terrorists, where people do not live but die slowly, as we have seen â and already mentioned in this debate â with the situation of women in Turkey, with whom I should like to express my solidarity.
These are the issues at stake.
Â Â  . Mr President, the United Nations declaration adopted in New York two days ago is an important victory for all women.
It has reaffirmed the Beijing Platform for Action and womenâs reproductive rights. That is something I warmly welcome.
Nevertheless, it is not the only important issue today.
A large number of women suffer violence at the hands of the men with whom they have or have had a relationship.
It is said that considerable progress has been made, but in fact there has been no progress, because we have not yet realised the full extent of the problem.
In terms of figures, we are talking about at least one-fifth of all women in the EU, with some studies currently putting the true figure as high as one-third.
This is an epidemic in our society.
As rapporteur on this matter, I am finalising a report in which I urge all Member States to carry out accurate studies on prevalence.
We need correct figures on a Europe-wide scale.
I will also propose a âname and fameâ list of the countries, regions and cities dealing with this issue in the right way.
It is clear, for example, that Spain is one country doing much to change this sad state of affairs, and I take this opportunity to say
Finally, I want to highlight the most extreme form of violence against women.
On our continent, women and girls are being sold like cattle.
We all know about this.
It is the most devastating of human rights crises, currently affecting hundreds of thousands of women in Europe alone, and it is happening right now as we commemorate International Womenâs Day.
It is modern slavery.
Where there is demand, there will be supply.
Consequently, from now on I will end all my speeches in this House with a phrase borrowed from a famous Roman politician: ââI therefore maintain that prostitution must be abolishedâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Beijing Platform for Action was a milestone, and the Commissionâs past policies often a beacon, in terms of policy on womenâs issues.
I hope that will continue to be the case, and that the equal opportunities policy for women will not come to a standstill.
Today, Commissioner Å pidla, I have been very disappointed by what you have said; you had a lot to say about what had happened in the past, but I heard little about what you want to do in the future.
We have waited a long time for this Gender Institute, yet you had not one word to say about the topic of gender budgeting.
I heard nothing from you about how we are meant to do away with the wage gap, which really is a cause for concern to us, not to mention the day for the elimination of violence against women.
The President-in-Office of the Council said it would be next year; you said that Amnesty International had already held one.
If so, so what?
We heard nothing about it.
I hope that a policy of equal opportunities will not be something just for today, but for 365 days in the year.
I would have liked to hear more about the prospects for one; what is the Commission thinking of doing now?
What I heard was actually no more than empty phrases.
As Mrs Carlshamre said a minute or two ago, the EU, too, is the scene of genital mutilations, honour killings and forced marriages.
I call on its Member States and on the Commission to do real work to coordinate action against these things, for what I believe we have to do today is to send out a message.
Â Â  MrÂ President, over the years, the subordination of women, which we know exists in all areas of society, has been emphasised and debated on this day in particular.
Each year, we have pinned great hope on all the words being translated into practical action.
Certainly, progress has been made, but the basic patriarchal power system still exists.
It would certainly have made it easier to follow up the Fourth World Conference on Women if the President of the Commission had appointed a Commissioner for Gender Equality.
The significance and scope of equality issues in all political areas required a Commissioner for Equality concentrating exclusively on equality issues.
In spite of the fact that, unfortunately, there is at present no Commissioner responsible for equality issues, I would call upon the Commission in future to prioritise the work in pursuit of gender equality to the same degree as the work involving the internal market, goods, services, industry etc.
Part of the evidence of womenâs subordination is male violence against women.
The World Bank has estimated that violence against women is as frequent a cause of death as cancer.
It is the cause of more ill health than malaria and road accidents combined.
Most of us condemn such violence, but we must also get to grips with those values that facilitate the violence.
We must tackle the culture that says that women must be accessible to men and that men are entitled to control womenâs lives and bodies; the culture that identifies womenâs bodies as goods that can be bought and sold.
These assumptions underlie the everyday experience of many women and girls in Europe today. The names for that experience are traffickingand prostitution, but it can also be called sexual slavery.
That it is able to continue to exist is due to an unholy alliance between financial profit and a sexist and racist world view.
On behalf of women in the Member States, I also regret the neo-liberal economic policy, with its deregulation and privatisation, which makes womenâs situation still more difficult where both job opportunities and access to childcare and care of the elderly are concerned.
It is high time that the Platform for Action from Beijing were converted into practical policy.
On the day that we have achieved these objectives, we shall hopefully be living in a society that does not need special womenâs days.
Then, every day will belong to women, men and children.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, it is hard to know what to say about womenâs issues within the one minute of speaking time available to me in this debate.
As a woman and a doctor, however, I should like to protest most strongly in this House against the tendency to treat women as objects, to subject women to aggressive masculinisation and to use the phrase âreproductive healthâ to refer to motherhood.
This is clearly a phrase that should be used in relation to animals, not people.
A womanâs dignity and mystery are revealed through her role as a mother, which need not be understood in a strictly physical sense.
Emotionally healthy women who have not been corrupted are full of warmth.
They are by nature emotionally sensitive, they care about other people and they are prepared to make sacrifices.
Their vocation includes the home, the family, marriage, children and work, but it does not include a power struggle with men.
I would especially call on feminist organisations to respect womenâs dignity and femininity, which is an expression of their spiritual wealth.

Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, what we should really be doing today is paying tribute to women and expressing our respect for them, as this is what women deserve for their efforts as mothers, wives, active members of society and active politicians.
Now is not the time, however, to make use of the phrase âreproductive healthâ, which amounts to nothing more than thinly-disguised support for abortion.
We are well acquainted nowadays with the consequences of abortion.
As well as the consequences it quite clearly holds for physical health, which can include infertility, abortion also has psychological consequences, which doctors have named post-abortion syndrome.
It is simply not the case that the Beijing Conference introduced pro-abortion provisions into international law.
This is entirely untrue.
The Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote against this resolution because of its use of the phrase âreproductive healthâ, and it will make every effort to ensure that this phrase is deleted, as it is inappropriate and insults the dignity of women.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President.
Mr President, 8 March is an internationally recognised holiday, International Womenâs Day.
However, we regard this day above all as an occasion to appreciate the work of women for society.
We appreciate women as mothers in families on Mothering Sunday.
Sometimes, I do have the feeling that we serve simply as a reminder of certain terrible acts, such as, for example, the current violence toward women in Turkey, when violations of womenâs rights have not been taken seriously even immediately around us.
Physical violence in the family is the consequence of the inadequate work of institutions that fail to enforce the legal rights of women.
Let us see, then, how we enforce political rights and social rights.
Many governments, even the governments of the Member States of the European Union, and, unfortunately, I must say, even my government, have no women on them at all.
How, then, should we see the role of women in public institutions from a European point of view?
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is now ten years since the United Nations Beijing Conference, whose platform established the rights of women.
In Beijing, it was said that womenâs rights are human rights.
There can certainly be no turning back from that position, despite the fact that the worldâs more conservative countries have been attempting to do so for some years now. This was the case, in particular, with the United States last week during the proceedings of the UN Commission on womenâs rights.
The attempt was foiled, largely thanks to the European delegation, and in particular to the intelligent and vital work of the Luxembourg Minister, MrsÂ Jacob, who led our delegation and to whom I should like to express heartfelt thanks.
There can certainly be no turning back from Beijing, but a mere statement of intent is not enough; we need to speed up the process of implementing the platform.
One of the topics covered is that of political power, still predominantly in male hands.
Women still represent only 15 percent of the worldâs parliamentarians, and only 15 countries out of approximately 200 have achieved a level defined as the âcritical mass of 30%â.
When the presence of women in the institutions reaches critical mass, there is more likelihood that womenâs points of view and experiences will be taken into consideration, that priority will be given to the issues important to women and that action will become possible.
Of the 15 countries to which I referred earlier, eight are in Europe â in other words, less than one third of the 25 States making up the European Union.
We need determination, commitment and action if these eight countries are to increase to 25 â and this is what we are requesting from the Commission and Council.
Above all, we need people to be convinced that an increase in the parliamentary representation of women is beneficial to both men and women.
Spain, with its government consisting of equal numbers of women and men, is the example to be followed.
Spain, with its socialist Prime Minister Zapatero, has proved that democracy with equality can be achieved.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the last conference, which was held in Beijing in 1995, clearly identified a number of factors in female poverty and recognised the gender-specific dimension in the way governments deal with poverty.
The chain of events that lead to poverty is always the same: unemployment, sickness, humiliation and then social exclusion.
It is a vicious circle where women are more vulnerable than men.
Indeed, they are constantly in a situation of inequality relative to men, in all areas of society.
The number of women living below the poverty line has risen by 50% since the 1970s, while that of men has grown by 30%.
What is behind what sociologists call the feminisation of poverty?
No one can deny that poverty is fertile ground for prostitution.
Moreover, the AIDS virus spreads more quickly in environments where women are kept in a state of sexual slavery.
Europe cannot be indifferent to all that.
It must continue to play a shrewd and uncompromising role in ensuring that all the underlying causes of poverty are dealt with and that the most degrading of its consequences, the trafficking of women for profit in a parallel market which reduces them to nothing more than a commodity, is eliminated.
Â Â  Mr President, the status of women in society is not just a matter of whether society is just and agreeable.
Improving the status of women is one of the most effective ways of developing society as a whole and making it more stable.
Moreover, the position of women in the developing countries is connected with our security.
The Central Intelligence Agency in the United States made a study of countries torn apart by genocide and violence, and discovered that a high child mortality rate is the clearest indicator that a society is caught up in a spiral of internal violence.
A high child mortality rate is of course the connection with the status of women.
It has also been found that terrorist groups, which we now fear so much, recruit members from areas where there are a lot of unemployed young men with no good prospects for the future.
These young, unemployed groups form in countries with high birth rates.
The birth rate, on the other hand, goes down when the social position of women improves, when they receive an education and information on birth control, and when they have their own means of earning a livelihood.
With regard to development cooperation policy it therefore has to be understood that improving the status of women is one of the most effective ways of promoting development in general; not only that, but it can help to promote stability and prevent new hotbeds of conflict from springing up.
Â Â  â Mr President, women continue to be the main victims of discrimination, unemployment, violence, poverty and social exclusion and are barred from holding key positions in decision-making bodies and political authorities.
Against this backdrop, the fact that we celebrate International Womenâs Day, 8Â March, a day on which we fight for womenâs human rights, an integral, inalienable and indivisible part of universal human rights, continues to irk many politicians and governments.
Such was the case in Turkey, when police acted with violence against a womenâs demonstration â all the more appalling given that this is a country seeking membership of the EU.
It is unacceptable that unemployment continues to rise in Member States as a result of increasingly neoliberal policies, that insecure work is spreading in the name of flexible work and competitiveness, that there continues to be salary discrimination, that the trafficking of human beings and prostitution persist and that violence is a day-to-day reality for millions of women in the EU and appropriate measures are not being taken to remedy this state of affairs.
It is also unacceptable that health and sexual and reproductive rights, guaranteed by the Beijing Platform for Action, continue to be undermined in countries such as Portugal, where women accused of backstreet abortions have been subjected to humiliation in court cases and threatened with up to three yearsâ imprisonment, due to the continued existence of an unjust and iniquitous law that is tantamount to an attack on the dignity of women.
This debate will hopefully contribute towards fresh progress in the fight for womenâs rights, which is pursued in a spirit of solidarity.
Â Â  It is true that, in historical terms, not much time has passed since the first country legislated on womenâs equal right to vote, which according to the history books was New Zealand in 1893, and within Europe Finland in 1906.
From a historical perspective it is not long either since universities first opened to women.
On the other hand, if anyone looks impartially at the proposed introduction to the text of the resolution, they can verify that while mountains of paper have been consumed, and earnest bodies have filled weeks and months formulating dozens of documents, in practice little progress has been made.
Todayâs proposed text could be a cry of despair, for times have speeded up tremendously and unfortunately there is a cynical attitude around that we do not need to change the world because it is good for at least half of society the way it is.
The principle of equal work for equal pay, which in 1975 became a part of European law, is a good example of how a statute can be in force for 30 years, but life still goes its own way, and today again we can establish that the differences between womenâs and menâs pay have not diminished.
Indeed, in several countries this difference rather shows a tendency to increase, what the legal experts call a difference between the andstates of affairs.
However, there is also a much more disturbing form of tolerating this situation, violence committed against women.
It is true that in Europe rarely happen, but they do happen. In the countries of Central-Eastern Europe a woman dies every week as a victim of violence within the family.
We cannot always be effective against such practices and customs, which have no place among human dignity or laws.
Recent events in Istanbul show that institutionalised violence against women is part of life today, right on the doorstep of the European Union.
From the resolution what emerges is that we should solve what can be solved and talk about what cannot yet be solved.
Â Â  Mr President, last Friday in New York we agreed on a declaration on the ten-year review of the Platform for Action agreed in Beijing ten years ago.
The EU delegation â both governments and civil society â gave strong messages of commitment to further progress.
Thanks to the great cooperation with Mrs Jacobs, the Minister, there has been some progress over this period.
However, poverty still has a female face and violence against women is pervasive: one in four women in the world is subject to violence, a significant number of them in their own homes.
I also take this opportunity to condemn yesterday's horrific events in Turkey.
I condemn the violence used by the police against women involved in peaceful demonstration.
I am also disappointed with the negotiations last week in New York.
As a result of intense international pressure, the US Administration reluctantly accepted the internationally backed declaration because it contained the word 'abortion'.
We in Europe have an honest and meaningful debate about those issues.
European socialist women are ready to fight with all their energy against this conservative backlash in the US.
This is the right time for action.
Let us use the New York meeting to inject new energy and commitment at EU and national level: legislation, evaluation and accountability.
In its declaration, the Luxembourg Government advocated the reinforcement of its institutional mechanisms and the integration of gender into all its actions and policies.
Today, European socialist women have launched a pledge card with five priorities, the most important of which is more and better jobs for women.
We cannot hope to achieve our economic and social objectives set in Lisbon without more women in work.
This is not about women fighting for women, but about a common battle, fighting for a better EU for women.
Â Â  Mr President, in my speech I will focus just on equality and equal pay in the EU countries.
Unfortunately, the European Union has barely made any progress in matters of equal pay.
I cannot think of any single case in recent years in which there has been any genuine success in promoting gender equality in matters of equal pay.
The representative of the Council spoke just now and said that the ministers responsible for equality in the EU countries are committed to the development of strategies to promote womenâs employment and skills.
It is as if we women had no skills.
Perhaps we do not have the skill to catch up in the equal pay stakes, and that is where our skills should be developed.
President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, now is the time to take action to prevent us from losing our credibility completely and to enable us to fulfil the promises that have been given to women, children and men.
In ten years the EU could set itself the objective of achieving equal pay for women and men once and for all.
Finally, I would like to say that equality is not something to reflect on just one day a year.
International Womenâs Day should not be a day on which women are humiliated by being eulogised.
Â Â  Mr President, this year, too, 8 March, which is International Womenâs Day, gives us the opportunity to draw attention to the situation of women, which continues to be unjust and unworthy of them.
Women continue to be disadvantaged and discriminated against in every area of life.
We are still far from achieving equality of opportunity in such areas as education and careers.
Women are often denied higher education.
The lack of childcare opportunities often makes it impossible for women to reconcile work and family life.
Even though the work they involve is demanding, typical womenâs jobs are badly paid.
Women are continually on the receiving end of violence and victims of sexual assaults, often committed by those close to them.
There has recently been a renewed rise in the number of reports of honour killings and stonings.
A State of the World Population Report study published by the UN indicates that around 5Â 000 girls and women, in at least fourteen countries â Pakistan and Turkey among them â are murdered in the name of honour, although the number of such killings that go unreported is much higher.
In areas hit by crisis and war, in refugee camps and everywhere where public order has broken down, conditions are often catastrophic.
Around the world, 150 million women and girls suffer genital mutilation; it is estimated that at least 24Â 000 of them live in Germany alone.
In South Africa, a woman is shot dead by her partner or ex-partner every six hours.
I protest against the violence meted out by the police to the women who demonstrated in Istanbul at the weekend.
We all have to do much more for womenâs rights.
I call on the governments to implement womenâs rights and make them a reality once and for all.
There is an urgent need for womenâs quality of life to be improved.
Women must be accorded the same rights as men.
There must be no violence against them!
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issues we are debating today are not new, nor are they being heard for the first time.
The European Parliament is rich in debates and resolutions referring to the participation of women in economic and public life and to particular problems and discrimination which they face in their lives.
However, it is particularly important that we are debating them again today, 8 March, on International Women's Day because, in this way, we all â men and women â have a greater realisation that these problems are centuries old and cut across the ages and remain unresolved and topical.
They also have a global character, in that they relate to every society in every country.
This year, 8 March also coincides with the tenth anniversary of the Beijing conference and the adoption of the platform on a strategy to combat these problems.
It is a good opportunity, therefore, to review and evaluate the work which has been done and its results.
As European men and women, we have a heightened awareness of this global endeavour, because our historical experience convinces us that combating women's problems and achieving real equality are necessary prerequisites to growth, the quality of democracy and peace.
What I would like to emphasise today is that we need to remain faithful to the global nature of this platform, by which I mean to the monitoring of the twelve crucial sectors which interact: efforts on employment, education, health, combating violence and participation in political life are directly connected.
At the same time, however, we also need to monitor developments taking place around us and to adjust our policies to the new reality circumstances â social, demographic and technological â because only thus shall we be able to express women's real aspirations and make our policies effective.
Â Â  Mr President, there can be no doubt that, since the approval of the Beijing Platform for Action, there has been considerable progress with regard to women's rights, laws have been changed, equality policies have been created and feminist discourse is increasingly being assimilated by society.
But it is also the case, unfortunately, that the reality in many fields is still a long way from matching what is laid down in our laws and what we have stated in our declarations.
Furthermore, ladies and gentlemen, as we have seen in recent days in New York, if we had not been careful, the progress we have worked so hard to make could have been reversed through the negative influence of ultra-conservative forces and religious fundamentalism, particularly with regard to human rights and the sexual and reproductive rights of women.
Fortunately, the final declaration of Beijing + 10 reaffirms the Beijing Platform for Action in full.
This achievement has undoubtedly also been a success for those people who have negotiated on behalf of the European Union, and I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the good work of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Simply ensuring that we do not move backwards is no great achievement, however.
It is urgent that we make much faster progress in the direction we have set.
We have the tools; all we need is political will and the European Union must lead this progress.
Commissioner, Minister, our framework strategy on equality between men and women and the associated programme ends this year.
I would like to insist that, without a new framework strategy, it will be much more difficult for us to move forward.
We must also urge our Member States to adopt new measures in the fields that fall within their competence.
In this regard, I would like to mention today in particular the 53 measures approved last Friday by my countryâs â Spainâs - Socialist government, aimed at promoting equality between men and women.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me, on this World Womenâs Day, take up the issue of violence against women, which, everywhere, is on the increase.
The rise in the incidence of crimes against women, particularly the trafficking of them and forced prostitution, has risen so much in recent years.
Let me say, while I am on this subject, how profoundly shocked I am by recent events in Turkey, with women being brutally beaten up for demonstrating peacefully to draw attention to their concerns.
Let us turn from Turkey to Germany.
A young Turkish woman in Berlin, who had left her husband, was executed by her brothers on the open street with a shot to the head.
Her brothers seek to justify this brutal murder by reference to their familyâs honour.
This honour killing was the sixth in four months in Germany.
Where is the outrage against these murders?
Why is society not more up in arms about them?
Violence against women goes on everywhere, even in families.
It is estimated that one woman in five is the victim of violence at least once in her life.
Such a state of affairs is intolerable.
Violence against women must at last find its way onto the political agenda, and not just on World Womenâs Day.
Women who have been mistreated must not be shamed out of going public and drawing attention to their situation.
It is because they are victims, and have not committed any crime, that I am in favour of 2006 being declared the Year against Violence against Women, which is what the joint resolution on World Womenâs Day calls for.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 10 years after the Beijing conference, reality continues to be implacable for millions of women in the European Union.
Unemployment is three percentage points higher for women than for men; 33% of women are forced to work part time compared with 6% of men.
Pay differentials vary from 6 to 30% for the same work.
One woman in five in the EU is a victim of domestic violence, which is a serious human rights violation and one that must now be brought into the public domain.
The recorded number of prostitutes has increased 10 fold in 20 years and 90% of them suffer violence at the hands of their pimps and their clients.
Commissioner, it would seem to be a matter of urgent necessity to set in motion aggressive policies to provide information on rights and to enforce existing laws in the Member States as well as to implement an effective policy of controls and penalties, because it is not enough to set ambitious targets and then see nothing change over 10, 20 or 30 years.
It is not enough âÂ and this applies to us hereÂ â to salve our consciences one day a year and then despise women the rest of the time.
The enlarged, reunified Europe, the land of freedom, the land of human rights, has the duty to comply with its future Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, we are marking this day, 8 March, this year with the continuing follow-up to the Beijing Platform, following the meeting in New York.
But we feel positive and also ambitious and, therefore, we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats want actions to deal with the problem of inequality of opportunities for women, in work, for example.
We want a European Union that supports women effectively, that encourages the Member States to make working hours more flexible and to provide equal pay for equal work, we want parental leave to be enjoyed according to the choice of the parents, we want measures such as the current assistance Spain gives for children to be extended and become the general rule, and we want to promote the construction of nurseries, with deductions for companies, and greater benefits to be received by companies that act responsibly from the point of view of families.
We are distressed and appalled by violence against women, prostitution, trafficking in women and people-trafficking in general.
We believe it to be morally unacceptable and socially shameful.
The rights of women are human rights.
We are in favour of the development of States and we recognise the progress being made.
We believe that such regrettable scenes as those in Istanbul in recent days should be condemned.
The woman is the basis of the family and any affront to women is a direct affront to the family, the basis of our society.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to congratulate all women today on International Womenâs Day by sending them greetings from Swedenâs Social Democrats who, in 2001, became a feminist party.
I hope that, during my time here in the European Parliament, I shall also see Parliament become feminist, whereupon there will be a requirement for every other Member of this House to be a woman, for male violence against women to be higher on the agenda and for its no longer to be possible for men to buy women for money through the agency of prostitution; in other words, there will be a law prohibiting the purchase of sex in EU countries, as there is in Sweden. Full employment and cooperation on a national basis will be required, together with developed child care and care for the elderly.
Paid parental insurance is necessary if women are to be able to work and fathers of small children are to be able to share responsibility for family and home.
Gender equality demands unity of purpose on the part of women and men.
Â Â  Mr President, it is ten years since I was in Beijing representing the Irish Government as a Minister of State and I am happy to be here today to reaffirm the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.
Yes, gender equality is one of the major values the EU stands for and it would be very helpful, in selling the new Constitutional Treaty, if we stressed that it is reinforced in the Treaty.
Huge differences also exist between the theory, or the rhetoric, and practice on the ground in relation to women's equality, the and situations.
We must ensure, however, that we bring men, particularly young men, into this debate.
Their role models might have dominated women and not understood the concept of equality and so might not have been of the type we want our sons to become today.
We are talking equality and not dominance here.
They might have been brought up in religious fundamentalism and other cultures, where there was serious oppression of women and physical and sexual violence against women.
This is about choice.
Since we have been able to control our fertility, women can now choose to have one child, no children or ten children.
This is all about ensuring that women have the freedom to choose.
That is what the debate must be about.
But we must structure society so that, if women wish to become mothers, they can actually do that and bring up their children without economic pressures that drive them out of the house when the baby is six weeks old.
We must structure society and family life today in such a way that it allows women to have a second child.
The pressures on young women today in my country, for all its economic success, are such that they cannot afford a second child.
They cannot afford not to work; they need the two salaries to pay the mortgage.
They cannot afford childcare or care for elderly parents.
The traditional roles of women in childcare and care for the elderly are all part of this wider debate and it is not possible to do justice to the subject in two minutes.
Mothers cannot be fathers and fathers cannot be mothers.
Ideally our children should have both.
That will not always be possible, but let us have a broader and balanced debate and restore choice for women.
Then they can be properly liberated.
Â Â  Mr President, today is about applying Beijing + 10 to the European Union, of which Turkey is not yet, however, a member.
As rapporteur for womenâs rights in Turkey, I can say that, on paper, the situation of womenâs rights is comparable to that of the European Member States, although practice leaves a great deal to be desired.
Violence perpetrated against women, and the relative lack of participation by them in the labour market, in education and in politics, are still major areas of concern in which change is possible only if women acquire the right to be able to speak out and to demonstrate.
The sixth of March in Istanbul, when a demonstration to mark womenâs day was broken up brutally, illustrated how important it is still to have 8 March as International Womenâs Day.
If Turkey wants to be a modern democracy and to join the EU, it should prove that it can handle protests as an adult democracy.
The European Union has an important role to play in this too, in that it must show that it will give the situation of womenâs rights a prominent place on the negotiating agenda, closely monitor progress, and take immediate action in the event of violations.
Â Â  Exceptionally, I am not addressing you, Mr President, but the women who are listening to us.
If European policy is moving further and further away from the citizen, that is not true for womenâs rights.
Women are here and are placing hopes in us that we cannot disappoint.
Today I am proud of the European Union and proud of its opposition to the United Statesâ amendment, when it tried to restrict the right to abortion at the UN last week.
My thoughts go particularly to Simone Veil, who was president of this Parliament and who gave France a law allowing the voluntary termination of pregnancy.
Thank you, Madam, for your courage because you had a lot of mud thrown at you.
Today there are people who march through the streets shouting about your law: âThirty years is enoughâ.
For all the women who have known the distress of an unwanted pregnancy I say: 30 years is too little, because abortion is becoming taboo again!
Thank you, Madam.
All of us women together, whatever our political parties and convictions, will continue your battle to drive back fundamentalism.
And I will say to Mr Libicki, who was worried about post-abortion depression, that he should look at post-natal depression.
That is the advice of a woman and a psychologist!
Â Â  Although as President I consider your comments wholly pertinent, I will hand over to MrsÂ Batzeli, who is the last person scheduled to speak.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Union, living in the constellation of the Lisbon strategy, has set high objectives for increasing the employment rate among women and improving their position in society, a policy which must be implemented directly.
However, what comes first for the European Union is also to help third countries â developing countries â reach a level which will allow women to be treated with dignity.
Development aid and development cooperation must be evaluated and based on issues such as:
First, safeguarding women's rights as the core of human rights in a country.
Secondly, promoting special economic and social incentives for integration into the job market, effective dissuasive actions so that women's lives are not downgraded, wiping out violence, as occurred in Turkey over the last few days, and the participation of women with quotas in political parties and central and local government.
The intention to provide justice, an extended education, culture and equality are everyday acts, not just the subject of International Women's Day.
Â Â  I would like to begin by thanking all those who have spoken this morning and also the Chairman and members of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality who were present in New York for their efforts and their support for the Presidency.
I would also like to thank the Commission for its support.
As I have already exceeded my allotted time a little while ago, I will be very brief.
So far as equal pay is concerned, we need more good examples that we can exchange.
We also need indicators to measure both progress and lost ground.
Poverty and social inclusion must remain one of the pillars of the Lisbon strategy in the same way as equality between men and women.
I am in complete agreement with the European Parliamentâs very committed fight against violence against women and children and, of course, the fight against human trafficking.
I think we have an obligation to keep both men and boys better informed and educated if we want the differences between men and women to be respected.
In my opinion, we will only really be able to respect human rights if we agree to consider and respect each other just as we are.
Â Â  , Thank you for the debate, I think it was very profound.
The fundamental fact remains that the European Union considers equal opportunities between men and women, and equality between men and women, to be one of the key political values that it upholds.
We have made considerable headway in this field, but we cannot afford to stop now.
The legislative base is relatively solid.
This does not mean it cannot be developed further, but the key problem can actually be found in insufficient implementation.
This is a matter we must focus on.
It is quite clear that at one end of the scale of disparity between the pay of men and women, there are countries where this gap is 6%, while at the other end of the scale there are countries where the difference is 27%.
These are absolutely unwarranted disparities, and it is up to us to make the corresponding effort to combat this situation.
It is absolutely clear that special issues are violence against women and trafficking in human beings.
The group of Commissioners for human rights considers this issue to be one of its most fundamental tasks, and I expect that we will be able to make progress in this respect.
It is a palpable matter, a challenge for us, and there is no time to lose.
Several times in the discussion the brutal intervention by the police against demonstrators in Istanbul, Turkey, has been mentioned.
The European Commission responded immediately; it rejected the use of undue coercion, and I noted with a certain satisfaction (although we must reserve judgment at this point in time) that the Turkish side decided to launch an investigation into this action.
I believe that this is an important illustration of how influential the European Union is, and that it is an important example of a case where our efforts have helped the position of women in a context broader than the confines of Europe.
There can be no doubting the fact that mainstreaming remains a key issue, and it must be applied thoroughly; it is also clearly correct to continue a policy of developing the concept of gender budgeting, which, while still in its infancy, has already made gratifying advances in certain countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, the role of women in the success of the European project in general, and for the success of the Lisbon Strategy in particular, is indispensable.
I have clearly spoken about the fact that a society which does not make full use of the potential of all its members is unable to hold its ground in the face of global competition, so let us go back to my opening words, that is, the issue of equality is a profound matter and we must strive for this equality even if we were not to derive any secondary, perhaps economic, benefit from it.
The establishment of a new institution will ensure transparency and will also provide professional answers to a whole number of questions which have been asked but which have not yet been adequately resolved.
It will also evaluate and assess the techniques and procedures we have chosen that have often resulted in a certain progress but which have not provided a complete climax.
The situation of women on the labour market has been debated.
There is no doubt that the proportion of women actively involved in the labour market has increased during the monitoring of the Lisbon Strategy.
On the other hand, it is also evident that the total proportion is insufficient for us to achieve the Lisbon objectives.
Ladies and gentlemen, equality between men and women is a concept; it is a political concept, a concept of values.
It is a concept which has been observed for decades; International Womenâs Day did not start ten years ago, it did not start today.
It is part of the conscious efforts by people to achieve a certain value that we consider to be profound and self-evident.
These efforts must not end, we can never be satisfied with the progress we have made, because as the world changes the problems will change, and we will be faced with new challenges.
One of them is the demographic ageing of society, another is the balance between family life and working life, yet another, mentioned by several others here, is a deeper understanding on the part of our men within the framework of ordinary social customs.
We have a long way to go.
There has also been a debate on a European Day Against Violence Against Women.
Again, I stress that violence against any human being is repulsive and it is the obligation of the European project and the European Union to seek out effective ways of preventing such violence.
Violence against women is violence which truly exists on an enormous scale in our society, and we cannot remain indifferent; we must use all means available to us.
One issue in the debate was whether it was more effective to declare a European Year Against Violence in 2006, considering that 2004 was a global year against violence, or to declare it at a time which is still open to discussion and which would ensure it carried greater weight and greater conclusiveness.
This is the question; the point is not violence as such, because, as I have said, this is one of the key agendas which has been adopted by the current Commission and which it believes to be important, and which, I hope, we can fulfil as we strive to make progress.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to return to 8 March once more.
This day highlights the decades of efforts which, in the face of difficulty, have resulted in progress at least in some areas of the world, in fact I am sure that in all areas of the world, but by different means.
It is a symbol of the efforts we are now making and which we will experience in the future, because it is a symbol of the effort to achieve an ideal, and an ideal is always very difficult to achieve.
We can but do our best to come closer to the ideal, and this Commission has five years to take action, which must be quantifiable.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
In accordance with Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received six proposals for resolutions(1) in conclusion of this debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0035/2005) by Mrs Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the social situation in the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the time has come to pay closer attention to the social impact of the reduction in economic growth of more than 50% in the last three years and to the enlargement of the EU.
The social situation, as we know, is deteriorating, and worrying signs are already coming to light, notably the fact that 20Â million people are unemployed and around 70Â million people are subsisting below the poverty line, and these problems particularly affect women, the elderly and children.
Unemployment, which averages around 9% - although that figure rises to 10% among women and more than 18% among young people â is particularly rife in Poland, where the unemployment rate is pushing 19%, with Slovakia, Lithuania and Spain not far behind.
In other countries, however, such as Portugal, there are regions in which the unemployment rate is very high due to growing de-industrialisation, to the relocation of multinationals and to the privatisation of public sectors and services.
At the same time, existing employment is increasingly insecure and women are the main victims of that insecurity.
On average in the EU, only one in three permanent full-time jobs is held by a woman, and it is women who continue to suffer from direct and indirect wage discrimination, with wage differences ranging from 16% to 30% on average, and even higher in some countries.
It is clear from these figures that the strategies for creating more quality jobs accompanied by workersâ rights are falling short of what is required, because, in the name of competitiveness, emphasis has been placed on the neoliberal doctrine, on the European Central Bank, on the irrational implementation of the criteria for nominal convergence of the Stability and Growth Pact, on accelerating liberalisations and privatisations and on the flexibility and deregulation of work.
It is therefore essential that we scrap the Stability Pact and replace it with a genuine development and employment pact that gives priority to creating more quality jobs accompanied by workersâ rights, a pact that commits us to a root and branch revision of the Lisbon Strategy, thereby eliminating the liberalisation and deregulation of work and placing all of the emphasis on jobs with rights and social inclusion.
In order to achieve the 70% employment target set in Lisbon, 22Â million more jobs will have to be created.
Otherwise, instead of progressing towards economic, social and territorial cohesion, inequality will deepen, be it inequality between countries or inequality between different sections of the population.
At the moment, indeed, the average per capita income in various Member States is below 51% of the Community average, whereas in 10 countries the figure is over 100% of the EU average.
Furthermore, 20% of the population with the highest income was almost five times better off than the 20% with the lowest income, although this indicator varied from 3% in Denmark to 6.5% in Portugal and the situation has worsened in recent years.
Such inequality must not be allowed to continue, when 15% of the EU population is at risk of poverty, a figure that in some countries rises to 20% or more, as in Portugal, Greece and Ireland.
Welfare and social security benefits are vital to reduce the risk of poverty.
Without social transfers, including pensions and other forms of support, the risk of poverty would affect, on average, 30% of the population in Finland, 37% in Portugal, 40% in France and the United Kingdom and 42% in Italy.
With the rise in unemployment in recent years and benefit cuts in some Member States, poverty and social exclusion are now in reality probably even more widespread than these statistics suggest. This points to the need to place emphasis on social inclusion within the Communityâs various policies, especially monetary policy and internal market policy, with a view to defending the concept of high-quality public services.
The Commission must therefore withdraw its proposal for a directive on the completion of the internal market in services and must not push through new regulations on the organisation of working time.
Measures must be put in place aimed at restricting company mergers and multinational relocations, at supporting productive sectors and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, at combating existing discrimination, at promoting equality and participatory democracy and at reducing working hours without loss of earnings, in order to facilitate the creation of more jobs, to reconcile work with family life and to provide lifelong training and education.
The new social policy agenda must not be a mere collection of words and statements without practical content.
I therefore hope that there will be a debate in this House on these issues.
I should like to thank those people who helped me to draw up this report, which will hopefully be adopted without the amendments contained in certain proposals tabled by members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and by the liberals.
This is because what we need is more jobs and greater social inclusion, so that, when the EU speaks about economic and social cohesion, it will not simply be uttering words but will actually be taking steps towards greater well-being for all.
Â Â  , Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, MrsÂ Figueiredo, and the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for this report on the social situation in the European Union.
During the debates with Members of the European Parliament in the preparation of the new social agenda, which was adopted by the Commission on 9 February, I emphasised the significance of your bill.
I am using my participation in todayâs session to remind us that the preparation of this standpoint, including the debate held by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with representatives of social partners and civil society, has helped create a new social agenda.
Parliamentâs position offers a cohesive overview of the set of problems in this field, of which there are many. Unemployment, uncertainty, poverty, inequality, discrimination.
These are genuine, specific problems which cause grave suffering to our citizens.
They have the legitimate expectation that the European Union will tackle these problems and help to find appropriate solutions.
In addition to this, there are issues such as the impacts of globalisation, economic restructuring, demographic upheaval, and greater diversity in the European Union as a result of the latest wave of enlargement.
The European Parliament asks that the Commission draw up and publish studies and indicators focusing on all these main tasks and their mutual effects.
I would like to point out that the Commission regularly publishes analyses and statistics in its political documents, and especially in regular reports, covering issues such as the social situation in Europe, employment in Europe, and industrial relations in Europe.
These are documents which always arouse keen interest among journalists and entities involved in social issues.
I can confirm that I fully intend to continue this approach.
These reports provide a very good cohesive overview of social problems, offer a summary of statistics, and present detailed analyses concentrating on specific themes such as the protection of health, the quality of work, restructuring, discrimination and equality.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Many thanks, MrÂ President, Commissioner.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has an extremely negative opinion of the report we are debating today.
We believe that from the outset this report relied too heavily on an ideological approach to social problems in the European Union.
At the same time, it ignores a number of key practical aspects relating to the real social situation in the European Union and the real problems we face.
It would perhaps be best if I focus just on two issues to which I should like to draw the attention of the House.
Firstly, I come from a post-Communist country that for over 50Â years enjoyed âblessingsâ such as a planned economy, the abolition of private property rights and restrictions on competition.
I can therefore state quite categorically that the rapporteur has failed to make any allowance in her assessments for the significant influence of Communist regimes on the social situation in the new Member States.
Our past experiences lead us to believe that the European Union should not place excessive restrictions on the freedom to pursue economic activities.
The critical assessments in the report are used as a basis to put forward proposals to increase the administrative burden on entrepreneurs, as well as to widen the tax base and create new employment pacts, yet new pacts and new legislative solutions are not what we need.
Any debate we hold on unemployment should also focus on employers, as the only effective way to create new jobs is to make it possible for them to pursue their activities.
This would then solve the problem of unemployment in an extremely practical manner.
We will not create new jobs by imposing additional administrative burdens on entrepreneurs, raising taxes and placing restrictions on competition.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has therefore tabled a great many amendments.
We would stress that in order for the group to vote in favour of the report, the very least that would be necessary would be for all the amendments to be adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on this womenâs day the long debate we have just had on the situation of women would not be out of place in this debate on the social situation in Europe, because the questions are very much related and women are often the first victims of a much more general situation.
The social situation in the European Union in 2004, which we are looking at today and which is the subject of the report we have before us, is alarming.
Mass unemployment, social inequalities, instability and insecurity have grown over the last 20 years.
Although social development and the fight against poverty are the common objectives of the Member States, we are obliged to note that the laws of the market are today working against the interests of individuals and that more than 70Â million European citizens are today at great risk of poverty and insecurity.
The question we have to answer is a simple one: are we going to promote social equality and development equality, or are we going to allow free competition to make the social situation in Europe even worse?
We must answer that question by adopting a social agenda that takes concrete measures to deal with the problem.
I do not have the time to go into details, but I would like to suggest at least two priorities: we must move towards an upward harmonisation of social situations and not use directives to introduce social dumping; we need a sharing of wealth that allows solidarity, not competition between poor regions and rich ones.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the ALDE Group would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for all the work she did to produce such a comprehensive report and, in particular, for her willingness to compromise in committee.
There is a great deal that we can support in the resolution, especially concerning lifelong learning, SMEs, corporate social responsibility, disadvantaged regions and the fight against discrimination.
However, we have some serious concerns, more specifically with regard to paragraphÂ 1, paragraphÂ 5, indentÂ 5, and recital E. Meeting these concerns is crucial to our decision on the final vote.
We have two difficulties with paragraph 1.
Firstly, we appreciate the need for adjustments to be made to financial and economic policies over time, but the use of ârevisionâ implies a fundamental departure from them, as Mrs Figueiredo effectively acknowledges in her speech.
Secondly, the paragraph is too diffuse.
We prefer the emphasis that our own amendment places on how the Lisbon Strategy should address deficiencies in the current social situation.
In the other two cases, our concern is not with the whole content of the indent or recital involved, but with infelicitous phrases found there.
Those are covered by appropriate amendments or requests for split votes.
This is true for various other improvements that we would prefer to see made to the text.
Finally, on recital M, there have been some translation problems.
We would specify that this must be understood as asking only for Member States to consider introducing the concept of a minimum income as the basis of social protection when they do not currently have such a system.
It is not an attempt to move toward some kind of Europe-wide minimum wage.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mrs Figueiredo deserves a great deal of congratulation for putting together a very large number of arguments and writing a densely-packed report.
After listening to the constant talk about competition, economic growth, the free movement of capital, services and goods and so on, it does one good to see Europe, of whose being the âChristian Westâ we hear so much, setting limits to neo-capitalism and focusing attention on our fellow-creatures, our environment and those who will come after us.
We cannot be indifferent to the fact that, in a Europe that is generally rich, one person in seven faces the threat of poverty.
We cannot keep on increasing working times â expressed in weeks or over a lifetime â when we know that some 20 million people, most of them women, are out of work in the EU.
There should be more solidarity expressed in the way we share out work and wages.
We surely cannot look away when conglomerates, often having received subsidies for their businesses, simply move them to where they can make the greatest profits and where they find the most propitious conditions in terms of wages, taxes, social security contributions, mandatory environmental requirements, controls and so on. Businesses also bear social responsibilities.
Social peace is dependent upon justice.
Solidarity is the best network for combating poverty and counteracting social exclusion.
Social security contributions are often akin to a handout, a humiliation for the recipients, particularly when they are in need through no fault of their own.
I hope that a broad majority in the House will support this report and that the Council and the Commission will take up as many as possible of the issues it raises, for we cannot sit idly by while the few rich people in Europe get even richer and the number of poor people rises.
What is needed is a push in a different direction, and the one this report will give will be a big one, and in the right direction.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Å pidla for his understanding of social policy issues and for his commitment.
Â Â  . My group wholeheartedly endorses this report.
In the European Union at present, 68 million people are living in poverty and excluded from society, a state into which the unemployed, lone parents, and migrants are at particularly high risk of falling.
It is therefore not surprising that children from such households are at particularly high risk of falling into poverty as well.
In Germany alone, which is considered a rich country by EU standards, the number of children living in poverty is said by Unicef to have risen to 1.5 million.
There are three key factors that determine the proportion of poor children in rich countries: social policy, social trends and the way in which the labour market develops.
So it is that falling wages for the bottom 10% of the income scale has reduced family incomes in Germany by 23%.
Let me then, again call for this report to be adopted, and for the Council meeting in March to devote all its energies to the social situation in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, the social situation is dependent on employment.
There is a certain difference in outlook between Mrs Figueiredo's report and the Barroso Commission.
The report, if adopted, would lead to further initiatives and pressure to press on with the Lisbon agenda.
The Commission seems to be heading the other way, towards a freer structure.
Recently it proposed that 80% of resources be managed in a decentralised way.
If competencies were indeed to be restored to the nation state, the UK Independence Party might be persuaded to support the Commission.
This is because the UK was drawn into what was then the EC on the promise that it was not leading to a federal state, but that it was simply about trade.
If only that were so. One thing is certain: the UK has half the average unemployment rate of the EU as a whole.
Along with Sweden and Denmark we have the lowest levels of unemployment.
Governments do not produce that.
They simply make the conditions right for employment to flourish.
The single most important factor is the common currency.
Sweden, Denmark and the UK have not adopted the single currency, so they are not saddled with a single interest rate.
Even in the UK there is a disparity of economies.
The Bank of England cannot set an interest rate suitable for the whole country.
How then can the European Central Bank set a common interest rate suitable for a Europe with widely varying economies arising from such great geographical diversity and widely differing ways of life?
Along with my colleagues, I shall vote against this report.
Â Â  Mr President, I too would like to thank Mrs Figueiredo for her work on this report.
I agree with the general content and can support it.
When we speak about a social Europe, the most important aspect of that is our responsibility to those who are most vulnerable within our society.
In particular we must protect those suffering from handicap, from disability, from a lack of advantage.
The European Union has proven in the past that it can be a force for good by creating equality and providing greater social protection and standing for those most in need.
However, this is not, nor should it be, a one-size-fits-all policy.
There is no one single method that has been proven to work in any one area.
It is a combination of what is best from each of the ideologies, each of the methods, to achieve the greatest success.
So I would caution people against restricting the amount of investment that private industry and business put into creating new jobs, new employment opportunities.
I would also call on Members to ensure that they do not unnecessarily harness negative taxation policies that restrict the room for movement of governments and, most importantly of all, to ensure that we invest in the future of our people through education and life-long learning.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to thank MrsÂ Figueiredo for her report, which is both extremely interesting and much-needed.
As a Pole, I should also like to thank her for the thorough consideration given in the report to the situation in the new Member States.
The motion for a resolution raises a number of important issues, but the problem I should like to highlight is that of poverty.
This is discussed towards the end of the report, but data on the new Member States is lacking.
It should be noted that those who lose their jobs in Poland are not entitled to long-term unemployment benefits, no matter how low, and that the lowest rate of welfare benefits is around EURÂ 60Â per person per month.
I propose that a minimum welfare benefit be introduced for EU citizens, which could for example be equivalent to half the highest rate of benefits paid in an EU Member State.
Even if this only amounted to EURÂ 250 per month, it would provide our citizens with a basic feeling of security, and encourage them to lead a more active life.
I thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report before us on the social situation in Europe is a glaring distortion of reality.
I therefore feel it is an unbalanced report.
The text focuses on all of the negative aspects, which we acknowledge still exist, such as social exclusion, unemployment and the existence of pockets of poverty, yet chooses to ignore all of the aspects highlighted by the Commission.
In those areas in which the Commission highlights positive aspects, progress has been made in the social situation in Europe.
I shall now cite five omissions that I consider very serious; firstly, the report leaves out the fact that during the past decade progress has been made on employment, output growth and cohesion in most of the 25 Member States; secondly, it deliberately ignores the fact that, according to the Commission, the social problems in eight of the ten new Member States are mainly due to the totalitarian regimes that were previously in power; thirdly, there is not a single word on the opportunities available to the new Member States following accession to the EU; fourthly, the report disregards all of the complexity arising from the phenomenon of globalisation; and fifthly the report emphasises an outlook â an erroneous one in our view â that economic dynamism is the enemy of social development.
We take the opposite view, namely that economic dynamism, price stability and cost reduction are not enemies but allies of the development of the European social model.
To sum up, the report before us offers a highly simplistic view of European social reality, with smatterings of a certain demagogy.
Symptomatic of the ideological influence pervading the report, moreover, is the fact that nowhere does it mention the proven superiority of the social market economy over planned economic models.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to take this opportunity to underline the importance of the European social model, which is under threat from the Working Hours Directive or the Directive on Services, while the problems of poverty, social exclusion and quality of life are even more acute today in a Europe of 25.
A European Union of 25 Member States obviously shows greater economic and social disparities than when there were only 15.
That is why it is even more important now than it was then to promote real social cohesion on our continent.
To defend a European social model that would bear witness to a Europe of excellence is not to defend the .
On the contrary, we must take advantage of enlargement to reaffirm social and employment policies that can characterise the European Union and also serve as an example to other regions of the world.
What would greater competitiveness mean without a just social policy?
What would greater growth mean if it did not benefit the largest number?
The answer is obvious: everyone knows that policies that encourage social cohesion are determining factors in economic dynamism.
On the forthcoming 22 and 23 March, the Heads of Government will be taking a crucial decision for the future of Europe when they adopt a strategy that will set the economic development agenda for five years.
They cannot be unaware that a winning economic perspective must include high social standards, because these are also essential to a Europe of nations.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the Figueiredo report relates to a matter of supreme importance, namely the social situation in the European Union.
I should like to highlight four issues.
Firstly, paragraphÂ 18 refers to solidarity with the new Member States.
I believe the concept of solidarity should appear in the opening lines of the report, as it is one of the fundamental concepts upon which the European Union is based.
Secondly, paragraphÂ 22 refers to the European social model, and I believe that this should also have been given greater weight.
It is not enough to preserve and consolidate this model. It should also be adapted to the needs of today and the anticipated needs of tomorrow.
Thirdly, the report notes, and rightly so, that too little attention has been paid to social aspects in the Lisbon strategy.
Finally, paragraphÂ 4 states that social and integration policies are central to citizensâ rights and also to economic development, which is entirely correct.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, social cohesion can be said to have been successfully achieved when there is no section of society left to be simply written off.
This applies in particular to older workers, particularly to the women among them.
No longer must it be tolerated that, as has happened in Germany, the head of the state employment service can get away with calling for jobcentres to stop providing services for older workers in East Germany.
No longer must it be tolerated that thousands of unemployed people aged over 55 are simply, and officially, kicked out of society and their experiences of life and work consigned to the rubbish dump.
Any successful economy must build on the knowledge, and particularly the experience, of older people, and is in fact dependent on them if we are not to fall into the demographic trap.
It so happens that, although this was the line endorsed by the Commission in its communication at the beginning of this year, now, at the time of the mid-term review of Lisbon, nothing more is being said about real support for older workers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European social model has not developed out of nowhere nor is it the result of pure chance, but is, in fact, based on our economic history.
This model was made possible by a social and market economy whose economic basis was productivity and efficiency, and therefore a successful system of small and medium-sized enterprises, which we must strive to re-invigorate.
The tragedy of unemployment will not be overcome with demagogy or with hollow and politically correct rhetoric in support of the worldâs poor and underprivileged.
If we have imported people unable to play a role in our economic development because they lack the necessary skills, then we have committed a serious political error and should admit it.
Otherwise, the excessive presence of immigrants in Europe, with no prospect of finding work, will provoke a war among the deprived population and will fuel racism, created by those who supported this type of immigration.
We should reflect before talking about immigrantsâ rights to work while ignoring our own unemployed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will begin by saying that, in innumerable areas, the report contains congenial positions, and there is no doubt that it is incredibly well intentioned.
However, the problem with it, of course, is that it completely skates over what are the real problems in the European economy, and I am puzzled that no questions at all are asked as to why things are really going so badly.
Why does the United States have, on average, a 40.5% higher gross national product per inhabitant than we have in even the richest part of the EUÂ -Â 15?
The answer is very clear.
The European economy is moving too slowly because we engage too little in research and development.
We do not work for very many years of our lives.
Only 63% of all people of working age are in the labour market.
We do not work for very many hours per week and do so using antiquated technology.
It is no good sharing out poverty, as this report proposes we do.
The thing is, to increase growth so that there is enough for distribution to everyone.
Try looking at the figures for my own country, Denmark, and you will see that it has succeeded both in implementing a socially aware policy and in creating growth.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Mrs Figueiredoâs report, but feel there is a contradiction to which attention must be drawn.
In recital L, after referring to the worrying situation of unemployment within the Union, the claim is made that immigration is needed in order to tackle the direct implications for the current labour market.
I fundamentally disagree.
What we need, in my view, is more stability and fewer stop-gap measures, more certainty and continuity of employment and less public support for major companies, particularly multinationals, which benefit from incentives and tax breaks from the European Union and its Member States, often repaying this by relocating and committing fraud which adversely affects savers.
In point five following Recital M, a reference is very properly made to participatory democracy.
In this context, we should be continuing to pursue the goal of direct participation in the life of companies, as already stated in the never-applied article 46 of the Italian Constitution â borrowed, moreover, from the Labour Charter of the Italian Social Republic â which recognises the right of workers to collaborate in the management of companies, in the manner and within the limits established by law.
This is an example of a legal expedient which, had it been incorporated in the European Constitution and thereafter implemented, would have enhanced the acceptability of a document which is instead an intrusive instrument for the coercion of the destiny of the European population â or which, at the very least, would have enhanced its social value.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. We are discussing a report on the social situation in the European Union; this report states that the social situation is not good.
However, the report fails to name the actual causes of failure.
The true reasons for the slump in economic growth and employment are the restrictions in the freedom to engage in business, the rising cost of labour, mushrooming regulation, bureaucracy, increasing redistribution and the influence of the state.
The cause of the problem is that personal initiative, responsibility, and effort are kept separate from social and economic appraisal.
Redistribution breaks the bond between success and affluence.
The more we redistribute in favour of those who, through their own fault, are unsuccessful, the more unsuccessful people we will have.
If we continue to confuse equal opportunities with egalitarianism and mediocrity, the more mediocre people we will have.
The correct and only genuine way to improve the social situation is through economic growth.
Only a wealthy society can afford to spend more on social programmes.
We need to cut taxes, clamp down on regulation, and defend the freedom to engage in business.
The rights of employees must be balanced with the rights of employers; education must be connected with success.
The rights of diverse groups of citizens must not be allowed to overshadow universal rights, the rights of us all; support for one group must not result in restrictions for another.
I have found none of these solutions or proposals in the report; in fact, the opposite is true.
The report, as drafted, does not benefit the European Parliament, the European Union, its Member States, or their citizens.
And therefore I call on you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote against the proposed report.
Thank you.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, a much-frequented theme in the new Member States is the reform of the pension system.
In most of these countries, the main pillar continues to be a single pay-as-you-go scheme.
I believe that this system, once the necessary modifications have been made, the retirement age has been extended, and contributions have been raised, is the only system capable of guaranteeing a decent pension for future pensioners.
At the same time, this would make it possible to respect the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organization that most of the new countries have ratified.
The conservative parties in most of these countries are mooting a reduction in the pensions guaranteed by the state to a level under the limit guaranteed by the conventions, and the setting-up of another pillar based on mandatory insurance.
In my opinion, this solution is risky and offers no guarantee of a sufficient income in old age, because the legislation required to make this pillar work is very patchy.
What is more, the administrative costs of private institutions are several times higher than the costs reported by state-controlled institutions.
If employees are to pay mandatory contributions to private insurance in addition to contributions to a state pension, then I think a better solution would be to increase the contribution to guarantee the first pillar.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that contending with unemployment, which is a cause of social exclusion and poverty, is one of the most important tasks for the European Unionâs social policy.
If you look, though, at the unemployment figures not only in Germany, but also in my own country of Austria, it would appear that these efforts have already proved fruitless, for the point has to be made that, at the same time as jobs have migrated from them to low-wage countries, illegal immigration has created a new underclass at home.
When, for example, as we see from the German visa scandal, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Ukrainians enter the EU in the guise of tourists in order to provide cheap labour, this means in real terms that jobs in the EU Member States are being wiped out.
The war on unemployment must therefore also be a war on illegal immigrants and on illegal migrant labour.
It is self-evident that dubious organisations or firms must be prevented from bringing cheap labour into the EU under cover of the freedom to provide services.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my generally negative view of the report presented by Mrs Figueiredo, since its content runs counter to the economic and social policy advocated by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Though it is true that the text has been improved in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, it is also the case that it retains a tone which is clearly in favour of interventionism, and all the factors that mean economic and social development in the European Union, such as private initiative, the market or competition policy, are forgotten and relegated to second place.
In short, this report defends policies and formulas that have traditionally been advocated by the European left.
Our first amendment, therefore, is intended to highlight the important role of private initiative in the Unionâs development.
With regard to paragraph 1, as other rapporteurs have mentioned, I believe that its wording is particularly inappropriate.
A reading of it would suggest that the European Unionâs unemployment problems are due to the Stability Pact, the Lisbon Strategy, the internal market or competition policy.
It is precisely these factors, I believe, that need to be strengthened if we want to ensure that the Union grows, creates employment and enjoys greater social cohesion.
And this is the case, for example, in my country, Spain, as has been demonstrated, where over recent years, an economic policy based on the balance of public accounts, tax reductions and the implementation of liberalising reforms in key sectors has led to the creation of five million jobs.
As the High-Level Group chaired by Wim Kok has recognised, the problem stems from the lack of commitment on the part of some Member States to the reforms necessary for implementing strategies, rather than the strategy itself.
Finally, our only intention with the rest of the amendments is for this Parliament to reflect the concern at the problems faced by young people in terms of accessing the labour market, as well as the need to remove the fiscal and administrative barriers faced by European entrepreneurs.
Â Â  Mr President, the rise in unemployment in the EU, which has now reached nearly 20 million, affects in particular women, people with disabilities and workers who, being over the age of 50, are discriminated against as being too old.
The constantly decreasing number of people in work has resulted in drastic cutbacks in social security systems.
Any pro-active policy for the social market economy must have a particular concern for societyâs outsiders, for young people without adequate education, for people who are poorly integrated into society.
Mr Silva Peneda is absolutely right; this draft report is permeated by an ideological bias.
Even over 100 amendments have done little to improve it.
We have in any case got shot of the demand for mergers and relocations to be made conditional upon the retention of jobs.
Such an idea would occur only to a central authority with the right to give or withhold permission, and is fatally reminiscent of the state control that characterised the socialism that is now defunct.
What we favour is the involvement of the social partners and European social dialogue.
I would like to see the report âThe state of corporate social responsibilityâ made compulsory reading for managers.
Our Commissioner Å pidla is on the receiving end of Mrs Figueiredo continuing assertions to the effect that the Lisbon strategy gives too little weight to the social dimension.
Welfare is every bit as significant as stable prices, reduced costs and smaller budget deficits.
What we need is growth that achieves a balance between economic considerations and the need for job creation, thus making successful social integration possible.
She is still calling for the financial perspective and the Structural Funds to be topped up.
Where, though, is the money supposed to come from?
My proposal for burdens to be shared out fairly between the Member States, thus guaranteeing planning and funding, was of course rejected.
Far from being a mish-mash of every kind of desirable thing, a new social policy agenda should concentrate on practically achievable actions, primarily investments in education, training and lifelong learning, with a marked rise in employment and a consequent reduction in unemployment, which is the basic cause of social exclusion.
Â Â  Mr President, this is not a legislative report, and might therefore be regarded as unimportant.
However, I agree with Mr KuÅakowski that it is an important report, for two reasons.
The first reason is the subject matter itself: the fact that growth across the EU has halved in the past three years, and that unemployment now affects 20 million people, constitutes not just an economic disaster but also a gigantic social disaster.
As so often when unemployment rises, the hardest hit are the vulnerable: young people trying to enter the employment market for the first time; young mothers trying to re-enter it; older people trying to stay in it.
Those are some of the groups who suffer most, as was so eloquently pointed out by my colleague Mr Crowley and emphasised by his constituents in the visitorsâ gallery.
This subject calls for debate, but above all it calls for action.
The second reason this issue is so important is the difference in views over the action required.
Some political parties want to drive real change, whereas others are determined to block it.
The rapporteur believes that we need more, rather than less, of the failed policies of the past: that more public sector jobs are one answer; that harmonised labour regulations are another; that more targets are another; that more legislation can produce more jobs; that the Services Directive should be dropped when it should be embraced; that the European social model should be preserved when it should be reformed.
The former would be a recipe for more unemployment and greater social injustice.
The question now is whether, as in committee, the Socialists and Communists will vote as one to keep the old, failed agenda intact.
On our side, we believe that it should not be voted through without fundamental amendment.
We will vote to deliver the Lisbon Agenda, which means voting against the report as it stands.
Â Â  â Mr President, the European Union's objectives, according to the European Constitution, are to achieve full employment and social progress, combat social exclusion and discrimination and promote social justice and protection.
Just how far away we are from these objectives is illustrated by the information set out in the Commission report: twenty million European citizens are unemployed and seventy million are on the verge of poverty.
Violence against women and inequality between men and women have not disappeared.
For the rest, we are celebrating Women's Day today.
What are we actually doing to wipe out violence against women and the family, when the results of research under the Daphne I programme have yet to be applied?
When there are such social deficits, we cannot in fact talk about social protection and justice.
Unfortunately, the Lisbon strategy has proven so far to be inadequate in drastically tackling the deficits in the social sector in the Union.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union places man at the heart of its action.
The Council and the Commission talk about progress and increasing averages in the various social sectors.
However, the minimum levels of civil and social rights of each citizen defined in the charter are evaluated not by averages, but by personal criteria.
Sustainable development and social justice make sense not only when the general indicator of the economy and of human prosperity increases, but when social cohesion also progresses.
Consequently, the main objective of the Union should not only be how to improve the life of the majority of citizens, it should basically be how to make the bad life of any minority into a good life at least.
The time has come for radical decisions and effective action.
The responsibility lies with the Commission and each Member State of the European Union.
The roadmap of the Lisbon strategy should be adjusted to the new circumstances.
The objective is a dignified life for every European citizen, for every European citizen without exception.
Â Â  , I would like to make a brief intervention in this debate.
The problems that have been formulated are clearly problems which are discussed in texts and documents presented by the European Commission.
These are texts in which we seek solutions to the problems that genuinely exist in Europe.
I am sure that the reformulated Lisbon Agenda, connected with the social agenda, contains solutions which are capable of leading us forward.
It is abundantly clear that Europe needs to grow, just as it is absolutely self-evident that Europe needs social responsibility, and it is quite clear that there are indivisible links between these two elements and therefore neither of them should be taken out of context.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0045/2005) by Mr SÃ¡nchezÂ Presedo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a Council regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences.
I am giving the floor straight away to MrÂ Mandelson on behalf of the Commission.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for inviting me to address Parliament on the subject of the generalised system of preferences and its reform.
The GSP is a key instrument to put trade at the service of development by helping stimulate developing country exports to the European Union.
The current system will be improved in four principal ways.
First, the GSP will be simplified.
Second, the product coverage will be expanded.
Third, the benefits will be focused on those developing countries that are most in need.
Fourth, additional GSP benefits â GSP+ â will be available for the first time to those countries that encourage sustainable development.
The new GSP scheme is simpler to comprehend.
It comes in only three forms: the general arrangement; everything but arms for less-developed countries, which remains unchanged; and a new special arrangement to promote sustainable development and good governance.
The graduation process will be clearer, simpler and fairer.
Graduation â the exclusion of competitive products from GSP benefits â will not be applied annually any more, but over the three-and-a-half year period of the regulation.
This will bring greater stability and much more predictability.
The new GSP scheme is a clear example of an integrated approach to trade policy and sustainable development and I am sure will be welcomed by Members here for that reason.
The new incentive for sustainable development and governance will support our commitment to core human and labour rights and environmental protection in the framework of our existing trade policy.
The reformed GSP will be a more effective tool to foster export diversification and economic growth for countries most in need: for example, vulnerable countries like Honduras; poorly diversified economies like Georgia; small islands like Sri Lanka; and landlocked countries like Mongolia.
My aim is to get this simpler, better scheme into force more rapidly.
Following the tsunami, the Commission has been keen to act quickly to provide relief for the countries affected in the Indian Ocean.
The new GSP will provide better access for some of the countries worst affected by the tsunami, and we want to accelerate its entry into force on 1 April.
The countries that bore the brunt of the tsunami disaster will benefit most from the new scheme.
Sri Lanka will receive duty-free access to the EU for almost all its exports, including vital textile and clothing exports.
India, Indonesia and Thailand will benefit from reduced duties and wider product coverage, especially on crucial seafood exports.
In parallel, the Commission is working on simplifying and, where appropriate, relaxing the rules of origin in order to make GSP preferences provide the poorest with more benefit.
The Commission will complete the revision of the GSP rules of origin as soon as possible.
Let me turn to the amendments proposed by Parliament(1).
Overall, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr SÃ¡nchez Presedo, and the Committee on International Trade, for the excellent work done in a tight timeframe.
I welcome the fact that the conclusions in the report adopted by that committee on 22 February are broadly supportive of the Commission proposal.
More specifically, the committee has highlighted the need for an evaluation of the functioning and impact of the current GSP scheme.
The Commission is currently working on an impact assessment of the GSP on beneficiary countries during the five-year period from 1999 to 2003 and we should deliver a final report to Parliament by the end of the summer.
Furthermore, I am also ready to report to the European Parliament annually on the impact assessment of the new GSP.
Let me turn to some detailed points.
The Commission is ready to accept Amendment 47, tabled by the Committee on International Trade, according to which âthe Commission shall, in close cooperation with Member States, monitor the imports of [some sensitive tuna] productsâ.
However, I am not persuaded by the committeeâs proposal to lower the graduation threshold for textiles and clothing products.
This would exclude India from the GSP for those products.
India is one of the countries that bore the brunt of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and where 300 million people still live on a dollar a day or less.
The time and circumstances are not right to make this change, as it would adversely affect India.
In this context, therefore, a decision such as this does not seem justified.
Member States are divided on the issue: some wish to decrease this threshold, others support a higher one.
The Commission proposal for a 12.5% threshold is a fair compromise between these two positions.
Then there are proposals that affect the eligibility of specific countries.
The committee proposes a specific clause for El Salvador.
This would imply granting GSP+ to a country that has not ratified a maximum of two ILO Conventions due to constitutional constraints, but undertakes to ratify and implement them as quickly as possible.
I think you will agree that any ad hoc clause which downgrades two ILO Conventions runs counter to the EU policy of promoting core labour standards.
On 4 March this year the Council adopted its conclusions on the social dimension of globalisation, which ârecall its commitment to promote core labour standards and note the importance of the revision of the GSP in this contextâ.
Furthermore, up to now, El Salvador has not shown any movement towards the ratification and implementation of the two missing ILO Conventions â on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.
The committee also recommends a revised definition of the GSP+ vulnerability criterion, which would make Pakistan eligible.
Let me remind Members of this House of some of the history of this.
In the wake of 9/11 we decided to grant the benefits of the GSP drug regime to Pakistan.
Following the WTO panel launched by India against the GSP drug regime, additional tariff preferences can only be granted to countries facing specific trade, financial, or development needs.
Accordingly, the selection of GSP+ beneficiaries is to be based on clear, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria.
Any specific clause for Pakistan would represent a discrimination.
It would therefore make us vulnerable to challenge and I do not want to risk triggering another WTO case against the new GSP scheme that would not only affect Pakistan, but every other developing country that was a beneficiary of GSP+.
We should also bear in mind that Pakistan is one of the largest GSP beneficiaries, whereas GSP+ is targeted at the most vulnerable countries, in particular the smallest ones which represent less than 1% of GSP-covered trade flows.
But I would like to stress that Pakistan will not be disadvantaged.
It will enjoy favourable treatment in the new scheme, as it will benefit from reduced duties for all its exports to the EU market.
In conclusion, I believe that the new GSP scheme opens good market access opportunities for developing countries.
It is simpler, it is more predictable and covers a broader range of products.
By ensuring its WTO compatibility, it will provide legal security to our trading partners and on that basis I commend it to this House.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been the pioneer in the establishment of the generalised system of preferences (GSP).
Since 1971, following the Recommendation of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, non-reciprocal preferential treatment has been granted to developing countries, currently benefiting 177 countries, 50 of which are amongst the least-developed countries.
The European Union imports more products covered by the GSP than all the other developed countries put together and three times more than the second largest importer.
The first GSP regulation of the 21st Century must re-affirm the European Unionâs leading role in promoting sustainable development and trade in the world.
The Declaration of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation, held in Doha in 2001, recognised that international trade could play a more important role in the promotion of economic development and the reduction of poverty.
The new regulation is the first to be adopted by the European Union of 25.
It provides access to a market larger than the 450 million people who live in it, which may become even larger with the incorporation of two new Member States.
It is necessary because of the need to review the special drugs system, taking on board the requirements of the World Trade Organisationâs ruling of April 2004, which must come into effect on 1 July of this year.
The rapporteur takes a positive view of the Councilâs consultation of Parliament within a procedure in which codecision is not yet applied.
He believes that the new initiative should have been preceded by a study on the impact of the system on the beneficiary countries and more time for hearing experts, specialist organisations, beneficiary countries and representatives of civil society. That would have allowed the report of the Committee on Development to be linked with those of other parliamentary committees.
The report proposes that the review of the system in the future should be better organised and more participatory and that Parliamentâs role should be enhanced, without changing the balance of powers, although it improves good European governance.
We support Commissioner Mandelsonâs initiative to present a revised proposal to bring the application of the Regulation forward to 1 April so that the countries affected by the tsunami can benefit from it as soon as possible.
Even though its method for producing a provisional list for application of GSP + seems appropriate, the truth is that it only includes six countries and leaves out the majority of those that were benefiting from its preferences, and their exclusion is not compensated for by the increase of more than 200 products in the general GSP.
For reasons of legal certainty, good administration and legitimate confidence, it appears appropriate to guarantee that the countries not included on the list can continue temporarily to enjoy the advantages they had been receiving, until the end of the present year.
I would like to stress that compliance with the requirements for benefiting from the new incentive must conform to the requirements of the rule of law and the case of El Salvador will demonstrate this.
An end to violence and the pacification of El Salvador have been encouraged and supported through the granting of a preferential system by the Union.
Though the current El Salvador Constitution, which has promoted a delicate balance of agreement, does not conform immediately and entirely to the new requirements, though it does fulfil its fundamental objectives, this should not prevent us from seeking formulae such as the one proposed in the report on compliance by equivalence.
An excessively restrictive definition of the vulnerability requirement for accessing the special incentive arrangement must also be avoided.
The report proposes the provision of technical assistance, in order to create the institutional and regulatory capacity necessary to allow the beneficiary countries to increase the level of utilisation of the system, which is currently low.
From the sectoral point of view, I would like to highlight the acceptance of the compromise amendment, presented with the rapporteur for the Committee on Development, in order to link the timescales for the liberalisation of sugar with those established in the reform of the common organisation of the markets, as well as the amendments in the field of textiles and fisheries products.
Rules of origin, even when they are not part of the new regulation, are a key aspect and the rapporteur advocates that their form, substance and procedures should be reformed as soon as possible.
The report has dealt with other future aspects, such as the preservation of the basis for calculation, the extension of sensitive products and taking account of the interests of the ACP countries that are not capable of concluding an EPA.
I shall end by pointing out that the new GSP +, by making human development the central nucleus of any development strategy, must become the backbone of the future SGP and I would like to thank you for your attention and thank everybody who has participated in the result of my report for their cooperation.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the sitting service informs me that we are running very late and suggests that we continue this debate for around 10 minutes, until all who are speaking on behalf of their groups have spoken.
I am therefore going to ask you for 10 minutesâ patience and attentive listening.
Thank you in advance for the respect you are going to show to those who will be speaking.
Â Â  . Mr President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development, I should first of all like to thank Commissioner Mandelson for the words he has just spoken.
I can very much identify, and indeed agree, with the different elements he listed.
Trade and development cooperation are very closely interwoven.
The scheme of generalised tariff preferences â the subject of our debate today â is a prime example of this.
The amount we spend via this scheme of trade benefits is higher than the total European budget for development cooperation.
A review of the system was critical as it was simply being underused and the excessively complex structure did not comply with the rules of the WTO.
It follows that a simplification, an improvement, can yield extra benefits, and this is very significant, certainly if the countries in question adhere to the international standards for good governance and working conditions.
However, in order to make the system effective, the Commission must review the rules of origin promptly, because that will dictate whether we can actually make it more effective for the countries.
It is of great importance for the benefits to be generous and for us not to try to reintroduce protectionism via the backdoor by excluding all kinds of products, as the Commissioner referred to a moment ago.
We support the new schemeâs proposal for prompt implementation on 1 April for the countries affected by the tsunami, but we are also arguing in favour of a transitional period for the countries that are not yet ready.
It is also a question of trust.
Finally, I should like to mention the relationship between the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), about which the European Commission is currently negotiating with the ACP countries.
As the Commissioner is aware, the trade agreements are not uncontroversial; they are reported to involve trade liberalisation that is too rapid and too rigorous.
It is therefore of the utmost importance that the ACP countries and, above all, those that are not among the least developed countries, should have alternatives if they do not want to join the EPAs.
The review in 2008 of the GSP plus could prove to be a sound alternative for this.
I would advise the Commissioner to really get down to business in this respect.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are debating the reform of the generalised system of preferences â the GSP â for developing countries.
As has already been said, this system is one of the most important instruments for bringing about economic development in developing countries and, as such, a fairer distribution in the world.
It offers trade benefits to the countries that are most in need of them.
In addition, the countries that perform well in terms of human rights, good governance, labour legislation and sustainable development, are given even more benefits through what is termed the GSP plus programme, intended as an extra incentive for governments to carry out serious and sustainable work in further stabilising and developing their countries.
The existing GSP scheme is being reviewed, as was long overdue.
To date, very little use has been made of the opportunities which this scheme offers, and that is why attempts have been made to simplify it and to make it more transparent and more objective.
That will not be a guarantee that this scheme, or the additional opportunities, will be used more often.
We therefore call for reform of the rules of origin and, above all, for adequate technical assistance to help countries examine how they can meet the conditions.
GSP plus should give governments extra incentives to practise good governance, respect human rights and so on, but the Commission only wants to grant the scheme to countries which already comply with it.
In that way, it takes away the incentive for countries which could comply with it in the next ten years, that being the period for which the scheme will run.
That is a missed opportunity.
The report therefore argues that countries which will comply with the conditions for GSP plus in the next few years will be able to make use of the extra benefits as soon as they meet the criteria.
Our group backs this report as now amended.
The subject matter is complex, and I am pleased to have been able to reach a compromise with the other groups and the different disciplines.
I hope that the report will be adopted in this form and that the Council and the Commission can accept the recommendations.
The Commission wanted to discuss this report earlier for the benefit of the countries that were hit by the tsunami disaster.
I hope that those countries will also actually benefit from this scheme.
The good news is that the assessment which we were waiting for has finally been completed.
Â Â  . â I should like to begin by greeting Mr Mandelson.
The generalised system of preferences has been an important tool for supporting developing countries by encouraging them to participate in world trade.
This openness arises from the EUâs responsibility as the biggest trading bloc in the world, and is in line with the positions adopted by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the Doha Process.
Since January, within the scope of the WTO, imports mainly from China have entered the European area unhindered, and perhaps too aggressively.
I say âperhapsâ because I must take this opportunity to express my disappointment that there are neither guidelines nor effective systems for gauging import levels, despite this being a Commission commitment for 2004.
At the same time, I applaud the EUâs rapid response to the tragic impact of the tsunami.
The present amendment to the rules of origin will further open up the European market to textile exports from developing countries.
There is a strong possibility that subjecting the poorest countries in the world to the simultaneous combined effect of the liberalisation of textile exports from China and the insufficiently selective treatment of the major textile powers such as India, within the framework of preferential treatment, will ultimately destroy these economies and regions.
I am sorry to hear that Mr Mandelson is not sensitive to this problem.
We must examine the perverse phenomenon whereby the strongest countries crush the weakest under the very instrument set up to support their development.
It is essential that in Europe, too, the opening up of the textile market to imports from low cost countries should be reciprocated by the countries benefiting and should be accompanied by the gradual adoption of fairer trade rules in social and environmental terms and as regards intellectual property, as proposed by the High Level Group on textiles.
Let us be clear: if it is true that European textile rules must be adapted rapidly, it is crucial that we prevent that adaptation from turning into the sudden collapse of the economic and social structure in European textile regions, with dire consequences, particularly in terms of job losses.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the generalised system of preferences, by means of which reduced import tariffs are granted to developing countries for the export of their products to Europe, is the most concrete application of the âdevelopment by tradeâ principle.
Last year, this system accounted for more than EUR 500 billion worth of exports from developing countries to Europe.
This report lays down the basic principles for the next ten years.
I remain convinced, though, that this proposal for a regulation is too narrow in its interpretation of the objectives that were prescribed by the Commission in the past.
After all, provision was made for a more effective system, which better accommodates the needs of the beneficiary countries and, above all, the poorest countries, which really need this system for their trade and development.
A commitment was made to offer more clarity, more flexibility and, above all, more transparency, including a procedure for swift reviews, if necessary.
I do not believe that those objectives have been fully met.
A step is being made in the right direction, but the reform is clearly not far-reaching enough.
That is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe abstained during the final vote in the Committee on International Trade and tabled another five amendments today.
These amendments have deliberately been kept to a minimum.
They are reasonable and, above all, intended to put in place more guarantees that the priority objectives will actually be met.
Our group would like the system, on the one hand, to benefit the countries that really need it and, on the other, to protect our own industry against unjust or unfair competition.
What we are hoping to achieve with our amendments is simply to combat the inappropriate or wrongful use of the system, and so I do indeed hope that the rapporteur and the Members of this House will be able to accommodate our concerns, thus enabling us to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance welcomes the GSP Agreement, but still has major concerns.
Allow me to point out the two most serious of these.
Regrettably, the majority rejected a number of the NGOsâ amendments â which the Greens supported â with a view to extending the number of countries entitled to aid.
The agreement means, unfortunately, that Indonesia and India are excluded, even though they have significantly lower average incomes than many countries covered by the agreement.
This means that EU taxes to the tune of more than EURÂ 200Â million per year are now imposed upon the tsunami-hit country of Indonesia.
In actual fact, it looks as if the great spirit of self-sacrifice in the EU countries has been converted into old-style EU protectionism.
We want this agreement to be extended to all the countries that comply with the sustainable development criteria, irrespective of their size.
Furthermore, it is disappointing that we continually have to wait for the Commission when it comes to a badly needed reform of the rules of origin.
Will the Commission please tell us when we are to obtain the proposal?
Without it, the new GSP rules will not work for the benefit of those for whom they were intended.
For example, another country hit by the tsunami, namely SriÂ Lanka, is affected because its clothes production only constitutes one link in the manufacturing chain.
The idea is presumably not that the help we provide should, in reality, harm those who genuinely need the most help of all.
Â Â  . Mr President, these trade debates are always very complex and generalised tariff preferences are no exception to that rule.
So perhaps we are lucky to have Mr Mandelson as the Trade Commissioner; after all, he is rather more competent than the rest of the shower in the European Commission.
If we go back to first principles, the United Kingdom is the fourth largest economy in the world, the third largest trading nation in the world and the head of a Commonwealth with 30% of the worldâs population in it.
London is the worldâs leading financial centre and English is the common business language of the world.
Why then, in view of all these things, have we been represented since 1973 by the EEC, the EC, the EU and no doubt, if the Constitution is adopted, the United States of Europe?
Surely it would be better for the United Kingdom to sit at the WTO in its own right.
Not only do we have a better relationship with our former colonies than most other European countries, but we are not dominated by the same protectionist imperative as the European Union.
That is why Oxfam has awarded the European Union its Double Standards Award for rank hypocrisy.
We want a British voice.
We want real British influence and perhaps then we can give the Third World a real sporting chance.
Â Â  The debate on MrÂ SÃ¡nchez Presedoâs report will resume at 9 p.m. this evening, because at 3 p.m. we will be continuing our work with Council and Commission statements on the Non-proliferation Treaty and nuclear arms in North Korea and Iran.
The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 4, 7, 34, 43, 45 and 47; and Amendments 3, 4, 16 and 21 from the Committee on Development.
The Commission would find it difficult to accept Amendments 3, 15 and 18.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51 or 52; nor can it accept Amendments 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22 or 23 from the Committee on Development.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  As announced yesterday, I have received from the Council a corrigendum to the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the directives establishing a new organisational structure for financial services committees.
In her letter dated today, the chairwoman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has announced that the committee voted in favour of adopting the corrigendum.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as we are going to endorse this procedure, I would simply like to draw the Houseâs attention to the importance of this document.
It is an agreement on first reading in an area of codecision.
