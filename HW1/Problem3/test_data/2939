That is why my group has proposed that disputes surrounding the Community patent should fall within the central jurisdiction of the Community Intellectual Property Court, with the possibility of appeal to the Court of Justice (Amendments Nos 26 and 29).
Finally, together with my fellow liberal MEPs, I prefer to create our own Community patent system instead of adopting the Munich Convention.
A Community patent system would fall automatically within the structures of the EU. This means democratic control by the European Parliament and the authority of the Court of Justice in the last resort (Amendments Nos 23 and 24).
I did not vote in favour of the Community patent. As a fervent supporter of Europe, I had wanted to be able to vote in favour but I was prevented from doing so by the linguistic discrimination included in this draft text.
Respect for cultural and linguistic diversity is now one of the fundamental principles of Community law.
In law and in fact, this principle is not respected in this text or in the institutions of the Union in general.
This principle presupposes the equality in law of all languages.
I have no doubt that we need to make the technical adjustment to this equality, but this adjustment must not contradict the principle.
As a Catalan, I cannot accept the fact that my language does not enjoy the same rights as those that are currently the official EU languages.
The existence of patents prevents the unhindered utilisation of every invention which appears to have been devised before.
On the one hand, it is beneficial for intellectual property to be protected from profiteers who want to make a quick profit using what has cost others years of effort.
On the other hand, patents mean that countries in the developing world are not allowed to produce any medicines themselves to control common tropical diseases and that genetically manipulated plants or animals are introduced onto the market on which inventors' heirs can raise some kind of tax.
Countries with a technological and economic disadvantage can most effectively overcome this disadvantage by ignoring the existence of patent rights.
In addition to national patent schemes, the pursuit of a world patent and the existence of a European Patent Bureau which is not subordinate to the EU, there has been talk of a Community patent, which is still controversial within the European Council, for the past 40 years.
And, in the final analysis, this proposal only pertains to the languages to be used, with English, French, German, Spanish and Italian being granted a privileged position compared to other official language of the current and future EU Member States. So also in relation to 22 million Dutch speakers and, soon, 40 million Poles.
This proposal is thus in all respects not ready for any decision to be taken on it, as a result of which I shall be voting against.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted today against giving discharge to the Commission in respect of its management of the 2000 Budget.
My decision to do so was determined by the following considerations: EUR 11.6 billion, that is 14% of the overall Budget, have not been paid out.
I take that as a clear indicator of the Commission's mismanagement, and also as a trend, as the figures show an increase over 1999.
The 20% of the resources that have not been used in a regular manner is equal to double the previous year's figures.
The Court of Auditors has, for the seventh time in succession, refused to issue a statement of assurance.
New charges in the so-called van Buitenen report have been known to the Commission since August 2000, but no work has been done on them, and they have not been laid before Parliament, thus blocking my report on the Leonardo programme.
In the plenary debate yesterday, Mrs Schreyer, the Commissioner responsible, showed no capacity whatever for grasping the Commission's shortcomings, preferring to shift responsibility for any irregular outflow of resources onto the Member States, something with which we are abundantly familiar.
The Treaty establishing the European Community, however, speaks of the clear responsibility of the Commission.
Mr Kinnock, the Commissioner responsible for internal reform, does, admittedly talk a lot about reform, but, as the Court of Auditors has established, the reform process can as yet point to no measurable progress.
The Commission under President Prodi is, for the first time, attesting on its sole responsibility to the management of the 2000 Budget.
It can no longer pray in aid of the misdemeanours of its predecessors.
I have therefore, as in the two preceding years, voted against the discharge resolution.
Mr President, how could I not vote for the discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Development Funds?
It is to the European Union's great credit that it is using the money - and a proper explanation has been given of how it is used - to provide communities in developing countries with practical aid.
I would, however, like to ask you, Mr President, whether you know how many pensioners there are at the moment who would like to go and work free of charge in these developing countries, to continue to feel useful through helping people who, through no fault of their own, live in countries so very distant from our own not just geographically but in terms of their standard of living too? I am sure that you, like myself, hope that many more pensioners will be used to provide practical aid to developing countries.
Mr President, this report - which I voted for - is on the subject of the European Coal and Steel Community.
I discussed the matter with a miner from the town of Gorno in the province of Bergamo, where I have lived for a long time, and he asked me why I was coming to Strasbourg today.
So I told him about this financial report by Mr SeppÃ€nen, and he asked me to tell the House - which, as always when I deliver my explanations of vote, is present in large numbers - that we must make sure we take greater care of those who work in the pits, as he does in Gorno, mining coal for example, so that they will live longer and be less afflicted by illness during their working lives.
I therefore hope that provision for this will be made in the ECSC budget too.
Mr President, my group has abstained in today's vote on the discharge for the Parliamentary budget.
This was essentially for the following reasons: we share with the drafters of the reports and of the amendments the view that clarity, transparency and regularity must prevail or be created, specifically when the position and responsibility of the groups in Parliament are at issue.
We do believe, though, that this cannot be done within the scope of a single discharge resolution, but that it calls for in-depth discussion and negotiations.
The same is true of the legal status of the assistants and the protection afforded them.
Mr President, Mr Virrankoski has given us a breakdown of how the European citizens' money has been spent on running Parliament.
I voted for the motion but I would like to point out that, one day, a vice-president addressed me as I was delivering my explanations of vote and said: 'Are you not aware, Mr Fatuzzo, how much each second of your explanations of vote costs?'
At first I felt a bit guilty, but I would like to point out on this occasion how much the European Parliament saves every second when I do not speak, how much the European Parliament saves when I keep to the time limit, as I am doing now, and finish my explanation of vote within the sixty seconds allowed!
We approved the Virrankoski report on the implementation of the European Parliament's budget for the 2000 financial year, as it makes a concerted effort to clarify the spending of the political groups.
As regards the assistants, we voted in favour of the amendment tabled by the rapporteur himself, which takes up our traditional position, calling on the European Parliament to assume direct responsibility for their administration. This means that MEPs will only be responsible for hiring and firing, and the right to determine their salary (within the limit of the allowance available, obviously).
This approach will enable us to avoid many problems.
As far as Members' salaries are concerned, we once again request that the main parliamentary allowance continues to be paid by the country in which the Member was elected, a request that runs counter to current plans to see this salary paid out of the Community budget.
It is a question of principle: Members must be paid by the people that they represent.
On the issue of allowances that are representative of expenses, we believed that it would be clearer to split them up into two groups, the first would be an exact representation of spending and the second would be a variable revenue according to the number of days that the Member attended Parliament.
The Member's salary would then be made up of a fixed amount, from the national government, which would be subject to national tax, and a variable amount, drawn from the European Parliament's budget and subject to Community tax.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Having granted discharge to the Commission and to itself for the implementation of the budget for the 2000 financial year, the European Parliament has just referred back to committee the report on the Council's discharge.
This represents a break with the traditional gentlemen's agreement, whereby the Council turns a blind eye to Parliament's budget - even when Parliament introduced federalist elements into the documents by including, for example, a heading for the funding of European political parties - and Parliament, in return, hardly looked at the Council budget - which, in any case, seems more natural, given that the Council has superior powers within the Union.
Today, the European Parliament is reneging on this agreement with a vengeance.
The official reason given is that the Council did not provide the Committee on Budgetary Control with sufficiently detailed explanations regarding the use of funds granted to the common foreign and security policy.
This is merely a pretext, however.
The Council has sole responsibility for the CFSP.
In reality, the European Parliament has convinced itself, over recent years, that it holds the greatest legitimacy in the Union, and it is pointing this out to the Council.
The Council must wake up and take this matter onboard since the Convention which is going to discuss the future of the Union is about to begin.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Mr President, before I give my explanation of vote I would like to congratulate you on your handling of the vote on the Middle East resolution.
It was quite clear from the result that the majority in this House wanted that resolution passed today and it would have been an absolute tragedy if it had been deliberately scuppered.
I am very pleased with that.
Our group voted against the arms industry resolution because using more funds and resources to promote the arms industry in Europe goes against what the European Union should be about.
We do not need more arms in this world - we need less.
It is quite clear this is all driven by profit.
We are particularly concerned about depleted uranium because depleted uranium is a small-scale nuclear weapon.
It is very alarming that this Parliament, and indeed the EU institutions as a whole, have very little concern about the use of depleted uranium.
If we look at what has happened in Iraq, and even in Afghanistan, we can see that people still suffer as a result of the use of this weapon long after wars are over.
But it is easy to see that the arms industry as a whole is pushing the policy.
Apparently the Western European Union Assembly wants to be able to contribute to the Convention on Europe to ensure that the arms industry is boosted so that it can compete with places such as the United States.
When we look at the conflicts around the world we must realise that the production and sale of arms is one of the major factors contributing to global insecurity.
We should be helping communities and civilisation by putting resources into education, health and other important areas where money is needed, instead of using resources to boost the arms industry.
It is an absolute tragedy that the European Union is moving in this direction.
Mr President, pensioners and elderly people fought in the last war and their wives and daughters suffered the consequences of this.
They therefore remember well how horrible it is to be at war, and that is why they have had enough of soldiers and weapons.
However, they also know how important and necessary it is to have defence weapons and they hope - and are expressing this desire to Parliament through myself - that the European Union will have a defence army, a defence air force and a defence navy which are well-organised, well-equipped and capable of making people realise, not just in Europe but in places where there is conflict and war too, how important it is that there should be a European Union in the world with military equipment that gives it a genuine defence capacity.
The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted for this resolution, despite its opposition both to paragraph 8 and to the amendments to it.
We endorse the strong commitment of the British government to the evolution of the ESDP and to maintaining the integrity of NATO.
The Brok resolution is a good outline of the issues surrounding the ESDP.
Its merits are spoilt, however, by paragraph 8.
Without an agreement on the use of NATO assets, there will be no ESDP.
We should welcome therefore all efforts to resolve this difficult issue, not criticise them. This only undermines the credibility of Parliament.
The UK government has acted at all times in accordance with the wishes of the Council.
The agreement with Turkey was also endorsed by the Council and opens the way for making the ESDP a reality.
I speak in my capacity as Secretary of the SOS Democracy Group to explain our opposition to the two resolutions on defence on which the Chamber has just voted.
There is a range of views in this House about the military needs of the continent.
However one thing that ought to be uncontroversial is that the defence of Europe should be primarily governed by strategic rather than political considerations.
Yet this is the opposite of what is proposed in these resolutions.
The ESDP, and specifically the Rapid Reaction Force, does not extend Europe's defence capability by one more soldier or one more bullet.
All it does is to transfer the line of command away from NATO in the national capitals towards the EU's new politico-military structures.
At best this is a pointless and expensive exercise in duplication, at worst it leaves Europe weaker by cutting its links with the one NATO partner able to supply air- and sea-lift capability, advanced communication satellites and accurate missiles.
Again and again European defence ministers, including British ones, have been prepared to disregard the advice of their own generals in order to pursue joint European projects.
Perhaps the supreme example of this thinking is the Eurofighter, an aeroplane which is becoming operative years late, billions of euros over budget, and which is effectively already obsolete.
After all, in an age in which we are increasingly having to act out of area, what we surely need is an aircraft capable of operating from rough local airfields with low technological requirements for spare parts, capable of buddy refuelling and with a long loiter time. What we are instead getting is a plane conceived in the early 1980s as a way to defend the skies of central Europe against a massed attack by Russian MiGs.
These two resolutions have nothing to do with making Europe more secure and everything to do with making it more integrated as an end in itself.
Hence our opposition.
The European Parliament has again adopted a resolution on European security and defence policy (ESDP), despite the fact that the Treaties do not even mention the name of this policy.
Nevertheless, Parliament continues in its tiring attempts to bring about the creation of this policy in conditions that it set itself and which make its work virtually impossible.
We therefore have no sympathy for Parliament for the difficulties that it is experiencing.
The first obstacle appears as early as Recital A of the adopted resolution, which states that the so-called ESDP must lend 'credibility to a coherent common foreign and security policy (CFSP)' which must serve 'the global interest and universal values, as these have been expressed in the Charter of the United Nations'.
There is no mention of the interests of Europe or its Member States.
How can we expect people to take an interest in a policy which itself declares that it does not protect their interests?
My second point, which was illustrated so well by my colleague Mr Souchet in yesterday's debate, is that we cannot draft a common policy in conjunction with countries that have different, even conflicting, visions of this policy.
We must therefore break free from the rigid framework of the Community institutions and put variable geometry into direct action.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) In order to ensure lasting peace and international security, it is necessary and clearly feasible to move from a security programme determined by military considerations to a system of civil security that targets the economic, social, ecological, ethnic and cultural causes of conflicts, and to adopt a preventive approach to neutralise and deal with the causes of predictable and acute situations of conflict in Europe and throughout the world.
This is not, however, the approach that the European Union has adopted in its current security policy.
Instead, it has maintained a position of taking a very close lead from the United States of America which, in turn, is using the threat of terrorism and the efforts to fight it to develop a unilateral policy and to strengthen its position in the world. Examples of this are the recent statements by President Bush on the 'axis of evil', which appear to herald new military operations in other parts of the world.
As stated in the motion for a resolution tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left, but which was not, unfortunately, voted for, it is now time to radically change the status quo, specifically by disbanding NATO and the WEU, by insisting on the development and the strengthening of the OSCE and by providing ourselves with the appropriate material and financial resources. These are clearly ideas that the majority of the European Parliament does not support.
Hence our vote against the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I welcome active participation by the EU in crisis management, together with cooperation within the defence industry.
On a number of points, I do not however share the rapporteur's view.
There are clauses concerning the CFSP and cooperation with NATO that are all too far-reaching.
The EU does not have the same basic objective as NATO, and I am therefore, for example, opposed to drawing up a White Paper on security in cooperation with NATO.
Furthermore, I am opposed to the creation of a European munitions institute.
There is already practical cooperation in the purchase of military equipment, and I do not believe that the creation of a European institute would contribute any added value.
.
The British Conservative delegation voted against the Brok report on ESDP for the following reasons.
It regards ESDP as a fundamentally flawed concept, driven by the divisive and mistaken desire to provide the European Union with an autonomous military capability as an aspect of its political ambition to create a European state.
NATO should be the military security organisation of first resort not only for collective defence, but also for the full range of military crisis response operations.
Only in this way is the transatlantic security link properly guaranteed.
Adequate arrangements for the development of a European Security and Defence identity within NATO were agreed at Washington in 1999 and subsequently.
These enable all European allies to make a coherent and effective contribution to the Alliance and to act by themselves as agreed and required.
ESDP is a serious deviation from this concept.
Furthermore, there is no indication of any serious resolve on the part of EU Member States to increase defence expenditure or enhance their military capabilities in any significant manner.
We do not consider that meeting the requirements of the ERRF should be the "absolute priority" for defence procurement.
Instead, the priority should be to maximise the operational effectiveness of our own armed forces in the context of the full range of threats we now confront.
Defence procurement and defence budgets are essentially matters of national concern and should not become a Community responsibility.
The development of European defence industries should not be motivated by the desire "to compete with US industry" but by the need to provide our armed forces with the best possible equipment and to meet national security and industrial requirements.
This may involve partnerships with the US, as well as European and other companies.
I welcome active participation by the EU in crisis management, together with cooperation within the defence industry.
On a number of points, I do not however share the rapporteur's view.
There are clauses concerning the CFSP and cooperation with NATO that are all too far-reaching.
The EU does not have the same basic objective as NATO, and I am therefore, for example, opposed to drawing up a White Paper on security in cooperation with NATO.
Furthermore, I am opposed to the creation of a European munitions institute.
There is already practical cooperation in the purchase of military equipment, and I do not believe that the creation of a European institute would contribute any added value.
Mr President, Mr De Clercq and myself have voted against the proposal because we did not think it was appropriate to be voting on the Middle East today.
We have also voted against out of protest against the weak stance adopted by the European institutions on foreign policy in general and in the crisis situation in the Middle East in particular.
Against this backdrop, to level criticism at the United States and its attitude smacks of arrogance.
Finally, I regret the prejudice displayed by a majority of MEPs with regard to the situation in the Middle East which means, inter alia, that the fight against terrorism cannot be maintained adequately.
Both as representative of the Pensioners' Party and on my own behalf, I have been wondering why it is that we can combat terrorism after the massacre in New York by pursuing Afghan terrorists but we cannot do the same thing in the Middle East, in Israel, where the Palestinian suicide bombs have done just as much damage much more often?
As representative of the Pensioners' Party and on my own behalf, I wondered why it is that, if Yasser Arafat does not have the authority to stop the terrorists, he does not resign as President of the Palestinian Authority.
Lastly, why do we not speed up Israel's application to join the European Union?
I therefore voted against the resolution.
Mr President, I rise to speak on the subject of the Middle East so that I can dissociate myself from the motion for a resolution tabled by my group and the voting stance it adopted on the issue.
Having consistently criticised the United States for its one-sided approach which meant that it was exacerbating the situation by becoming part of the problem instead of part of the solution, I regret that the PPE-DE Group is putting itself in a similar position.
The failure of the PPE-DE resolution unequivocally to condemn the illegal activity of members of the Israeli defence forces and demand their prosecution is morally and politically indefensible.
Terrorism occurs not only when people engage in suicide bombing, but also when members of the security forces operate outside the law.
We must be consistent in our approach to terrorism.
Although I agree with the demand that the Palestinian Authority make every effort to prevent terrorist acts, the question has to be asked how can they act when their political, security and civil infrastructures are being destroyed in an incessant military campaign which has claimed many innocent lives?
Furthermore, how can Yasser Arafat exert any authority when he is humiliated in this way by Ariel Sharon?
A failure on our part to face political realities honestly and objectively undermines our ability to exert influence in bringing this bloody and terrible conflict to an end.
. (EL) After the humiliation suffered by the EU Council of Ministers over the last few days, culminating in the recent visit by Mr Solana and the Spanish Foreign Minister, Mr Pique, to Israel, the European Parliament has decided to defend the international role of the European Union by adopting a series of direct, clear, reasonable and realistic proposals to stop Israeli violence in Palestine and find a fundamental, long-term solution to the Palestinian problem.
The Council of Ministers should immediately adopt and promote these measures, as contained in the European Parliament's proposal. They are as follows:
Â· to apply UN Security Council resolutions 1397, 1402 and 1403 on the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Palestinian territory, including Ramallah;
Â· to grant freedom of movement to and lift the house arrest on the President of the National Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat;
Â· to support the Arab League proposal that an independent Palestinian State be declared and recognised by Israel;
Â· to send an international peace-keeping force and observers to the area under the aegis of the United Nations;
Â· to impose an arms embargo on the warring parties;
Â· to suspend the EU-Israeli Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement;
Â· to demand that Israel guarantee EU media, diplomats and ambassadors free access to the occupied territory and undivided support for Israelis and Palestinians and the international organisations working for peace at all levels, including Israeli reserve forces refusing to serve in the occupied territories.
In my view, the European Parliament's debate on the situation in the Middle East lacked objectivity, did not take a step back from events and was extremely biased against Israel.
I therefore refused to support the resolution tabled at the outcome of the debate, as this resolution also failed to be impartial.
In recent days, the Israelis have, admittedly, taken very harsh measures, but these have been in response to an extremely tense situation that has arisen as a result of cruel, indefensible acts of terrorism, which the Palestinian Authority has still not condemned in a clear and firm manner.
The underlying cause of this extreme situation is the failure to fully apply Resolution 181, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 29 November 1947, which provided for the creation of two states, one Jewish and the other Palestinian.
However, the second state has not been established, firstly because of the aggression of Arab states towards Israel and secondly, because these same states want the Palestinian people to continue to be disillusioned and resentful.
That is why we must revisit Resolution 181, which provides for two states, both of them secure and recognised, in order to restore a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East.
Furthermore, the holy city of Jerusalem should be granted international status, and its governors should involve representatives of the various religions.
The draft resolution is unbalanced and does not say what the European public wishes to hear.
First of all, the resolution should state that the people are paying a high price for the folly of their governments, since the latest uprising was caused by General Sharon's stroll - which was for purely electoral purposes - in the gardens of Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. It should state that we are increasingly finding out what a fraudster Mr Arafat is; a fraudster who is playing a double game, a warlord who encourages, organises and pays the terrorists while pretending to condemn them;
Second, the resolution should state that we have twice come excruciatingly close to peace, first with Mr Rabin, who, sadly, was assassinated following a hate campaign by the Israeli right, then with Mr Barak, whose offers of peace were rejected by Mr Arafat with the consequences we are seeing today;
Third, it should state that peace will not come out of suicide terrorism or state terrorism, and that where there were 20 or 25 candidates for suicide, there are now 200 or 250 if not more, as demonstrated by today's attack;
Fourth, it should state that Israel, which owes its existence to international law, cannot behave as if this law did not exist, nor can it ignore the Security Council resolutions.
I am not in favour of suspending the Association Agreement with Israel.
Europe has a moral duty towards Israel and cannot forget the responsibilities it has inherited from history.
I condemn the policy of the Sharon Government as well as the suicide attacks.
There is no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
We must follow the way prepared by Itzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat, the way of negotiation and peace.
Europe must make its voice heard and exert more influence in the Middle East.
We complain that the United States is the only country that can do this.
That is because they are present in Israel and are guarantors of its security.
If Europe wants to contribute to the triumph of peace, if it wants a peacekeeping force under the aegis of the United Nations to see the light of day and help to ensure compliance with a peace agreement and the Security Council resolutions, it must be more present, not less present, among the Palestinians and Israelis.
Breaking the Association Agreement will not help Europe to play its part and become the key negotiator it would like to be.
The path towards peace is narrow and Europe's role in this region is equally restricted.
Europe, however faltering it may be, must be of some use.
At its Strasbourg session, the European Parliament debated with unprecedented intensity in an attempt to achieve this.
It adopted a resolution that goes beyond mere good intentions, vigorously condemning indiscriminate suicide attacks and calling for an embargo on arms supplies to both Israel and Palestine, for a United Nations international peacekeeping force to be sent, for the convocation of the EU-Israel Association Council to be convened and the possibility of suspending the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Agreement to be examined.
Europe is weak: it has no common foreign policy and no military capacity.
However, Europe is growing and starting to understand that it must speak with a single voice and try to influence the various players, beginning with the most powerful, the United States.
It is too early to say whether President Bush will choose double-dealing or inconsistency.
What we can say, however, is that he has chosen, in the end, to distance himself from Mr Sharon.
According to the Wall Street Journal of 5 April, this is because he has bowed to pressure from Europe, the Arab world and most of the media.
In Le Monde of 9 April, Patrick Jarreau adds that each of the three protagonists has, in effect, played a decisive role.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
.
(DE) The resolution adopted by Parliament today is a step in the right direction, and we emphatically welcome it, for there is no reasonable alternative to a political solution, and the Sharon Government's present bellicose response to the terrorist attacks by Palestinian fanatics, which are contemptuous of human life, is no longer acceptable.
As the resolution expressly states, Israel's military escalation offends against international law and human rights.
In no way does it contribute to ending the terror, but is, rather, directed against the Palestinian civilian population and is destroying the Palestinian infrastructure.
We emphatically endorse Parliament's call for the immediate implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions 1397, 1402 and 1403, and especially for the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from Palestinian territory as well as for the condemnation of the attacks against Israel by suicidal terrorists.
To place Arafat, a democratically elected president, under house arrest is wholly unacceptable.
We firmly welcome Parliament's expression of support for an arms embargo on Palestine and Israel, as well as its call for the Council and the Commission to consider suspending the Association Agreement between Israel and the European Union.
It is, moreover, significant that Parliament is demanding free access for the media to the occupied territories and expressing its full support for Israeli, Palestinian and international organisations that are actively working for the restoration of peace in the Middle East.
We unreservedly support the condemnation in Parliament's resolution of the many anti-Semitic attacks in Europe on synagogues, Jewish schools and cemeteries.
Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure.
. (PT) Today's vote on the Resolution on the Middle East, which is supported by the majority of the political groups, with the exception of the PPE-DE, represents a major step in condemning the out and out war declared unilaterally by the Israeli Government and by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon against the Palestinian people and President Arafat in the Palestinian territories, which has already resulted in hundreds of deaths, a huge number of wounded and immense humanitarian problems and material damage, with the destruction of homes and of basic infrastructures.
As many speakers stated in yesterday's debate, the actions of the US Administration have also been harshly criticised, because of its responsibility for the way in which the situation in the region has developed.
Equally important are the measures that have been put forward, specifically: the request to suspend the Association Agreement with Israel, an arms embargo and the possibility of sending a peacekeeping and monitoring force to the region under the auspices of the UN, with the aim of securing peace, an end to Israeli aggression and its withdrawal from the occupied territories. We must also demand guarantees for the free access of the media and humanitarian organisations to the Palestinian territories and we must support the struggle of the Israeli reservists.
The draft resolution is right to condemn the destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure, to call for an arms boycott and to keep the option to suspend the Association Agreement between Israel and the EU open.
For these reasons, and because a proportion of the Right who still do not grasp the full extent of the problem are voting against, I will be voting in favour.
The Right still sees Israel as an outpost of Europe and America in the heart of the Arab region and as a military base near the major oil wells and the strategically important Suez Canal.
This is precisely what inflames the surrounding Arab peoples.
Israel's best chance of survival is to have open traffic connections with the surrounding area, to utilise Israeli expertise in the neighbouring countries and even to apply for membership of the Arab League.
The current Israeli Government is employing the fear of attacks as a means of pressing home its minority view.
It does not want to protect the safety of Israeli citizens as a priority. Above all, it wants to thwart the Palestinian regions in their economic development by destroying buildings, roads, the port and the airport.
The objective of such a policy, defended by an aggressive Right since time immemorial, can be nothing but a permanent colonisation of Gaza and the West Bank, with hardliners flown in straight from the US involved in Jewish settlements.
In this way, the Israeli Government puts the future of its own state at risk.
Vladimir Putin is being received today with great ceremony by Gerhard SchrÃ¶der.
They will be talking about increasing economic cooperation between Russia and Germany.
One hundred thousand people have died in Chechnya and Grozny has been razed to the ground.
This is genocide.
In addition, today, our Parliament is threatening trade sanctions against the State of Israel!
While at the same time the European Union is negotiating agreements with Syria and Iran, which, as we all know, are champions of the democratic values we hold so dear!
Stop this hypocrisy!
Sanctions, threats, condemnation and formal demands for Israel but indulgence and a blind eye for the actions of the Palestinians.
Where is the unequivocal condemnation of an education system which glorifies shahid [martyrdom] and teaches a whole generation hatred and murder?
Where do we mention, where do we condemn the financial support provided by Iraq, in particular, to suicide bombers and their families?
There is not even a fleeting reference to the hundreds of weapons discovered at President Arafat's headquarters.
We condemn the Israeli army for firing on an ambulance transporting a child, because they believed that the child was hiding a belt of explosives.
Children being used by the Palestinian militia, children carrying guns - there is nothing new about that.
I do not approve of the policy of the Sharon Government, I do not think that this military escalation will bring about peace. I call from the bottom of my heart for a return to the negotiating table.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We are all deeply affected by the bloody events in the Middle East, following which hopes of peace are fading.
We cannot remain indifferent in the face of attacks that terrify the children of Israel, and we cannot remain indifferent towards the suffering of the Palestinian people, a people that has been oppressed and humiliated.
When Mr Rabin was assassinated, Mr Netanyahu established further colonies, and hopes of peace grew fainter.
When peace was given a second chance thanks to Camp David, let us not forget that Mr Barak made more concessions than ever, but Mr Arafat did not accept the extended hand of peace.
As Europeans, we cannot stand and watch this tragedy unfold, nor accept the insulting treatment to which the European Union delegation was subjected.
It is clear that the attitude of the Israeli Government marks a turning point in relations between Israel and the European Union.
Nevertheless, we must not abandon the Israeli people.
The aim of the draft compromise resolution submitted at the plenary session of the European Parliament is to examine the possibility of suspending the EU-Israel Association Agreement in the future, but I would emphasise that penalising the Israeli people may not be the best way to get through to the person we want to influence, namely Ariel Sharon.

In the final vote, I voted against the joint motion tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
This was adopted by 269 votes to 208, with 22 abstentions. The fact that the resolution was adopted by so slight a margin makes it politically weak.
The truth is the only way to real peace, reconciliation and co-existence.
The resolution adopted chooses to criticise the State of Israel twelve times, but the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority only three times.
Neither Hamas nor Islamic Jihad - organisations labelled jointly by the United States and the EU as terrorist - is mentioned or criticised in the resolution, and nor are the Hezbollah group and the al-Aqsa Brigade, designated by the United States as terrorists.
In the adopted resolution, the European Parliament instead threatens suspension of the Association Agreement by the EU (paragraph 8).
Reference is made to the fact that, at the border with Lebanon, there are clashes which could spill over to the whole region (paragraph 2), without its being stated that Hezbollah, which is supported by Iran and Syria, is launching rocket attacks against Israeli cities.
The resolution encourages desertion in the Israeli army.
The PPE-DE Group's motion for a resolution was an important attempt to make the European Parliament and the EU significantly more relevant in relation to both Israel and the Palestinians by giving the most serious attention to the anxieties and suffering of both parties rather than of, mainly, just the one.
By adopting a resolution that is both unbalanced and irresponsible on the subject of Israel and Palestine, the European Parliament has once again discredited itself and provided proof, if this were necessary, of its inability to debate sensitive international issues in a serious, level-headed and effective manner.
The debate that our Assembly devoted to the events in the Middle East yesterday, including Commissioner Patten's contribution, was marked by a failure to put current events into perspective, the obvious imbalance in the positions taken and the absence of concern for the long term.
Europeans cannot complain that they effectively carry no weight and are playing no part in the search for diplomatic solutions to the Middle East crisis, that their representatives are rebuffed, when they are doing all they can, at least as far as the European Parliament is concerned, to take a partisan position, allowing themselves to be guided solely by passion and emotion.
Do we seriously believe that recommending the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel will help Europe contribute to an effective quest for peace?
Should we turn an indulgent blind eye to the abuse of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem by armed partisans, or show that this type of abuse makes the need for international protection of Holy Places even more topical?
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
I have just come back from Palestine, with mixed feelings of anger and horror at the violence committed by the Israeli army in the towns declared military security zones: there has been a curfew for over a week, power and water cuts, the wounded refused treatment, countless humiliations, the list goes on.
The population has been taken hostage and is being increasingly ill treated - there are rumours of massacres at Jenin and Nablus - and the people are isolated, following the refusal by the Israeli army to authorise the presence of witnesses, journalists or internationalists.
We must act quickly.
We know that the people of the region will never know peace unless the Palestinians receive justice and their right to a state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, is recognised.
This means a complete withdrawal from the occupied territories, dismantling the settlements, and allowing refugees to return home.
A force should be able to intervene to protect the Palestinian people and ensure immediate compliance with the UN resolutions.
This was the message of numerous demonstrations of support for the Palestinian people all over the world, in which we participated.
I voted for the proposed resolution as it aims to break Europe's silence of complicity, in particular by demanding the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
This resolution is neither fair nor useful, yet Europe could make an important contribution - it does have the means to be credible.
To do so, it would have to continue to support the genuine development of the Palestinian territories, and of the Palestinian State in the future, laying down respect for fundamental rights as an absolute condition for its assistance.
There is no reason not to be fair.
We need a lot of pride to sanction Israel, its people, its civilian army and its democratic vitality, and although collective responsibility makes sense, I am not sure that our history or our recent past really qualify us to make such judgments.
When we ourselves were faced with similar difficulties, we did not react any better.
Can Italy, following police violence in Genoa, or Sweden, after police violence in Gothenburg, give Israel appropriate lessons in maintaining public order?
Can France, whose troops camped outside Srebrenitza during the massacres?
Can Spain, which as we know suppressed Basque terrorists, or England, which censored information during the Falklands war, teach Israel lessons in transparency?
Rather than rushing to condemn Israel again?

Last Saturday, Mr President, I was a guest at the Transnational Radical Party Congress in Geneva.
While I was there, I listened very carefully to the Chechen Foreign Minister, Ilyas Akhmadov, who, like myself was a guest at the Congress too.
I was already aware of the tragedy taking place in Chechnya and the suffering of the Chechen people, so many thousands of whom have died, but the Foreign Minister's speech further convinced me how important it is to remember all the people who cannot obtain independence through self-determination and who suffer such severe violations of rights.
I therefore congratulate the European Parliament on adopting the resolution.
At the risk of upsetting the harmonious unanimity in this Assembly, which, in any case, seems rather artificial to me, I would like to make two comments in relation to this debate.
First, I see that, once again, the European Union, in general, and this Parliament, in particular, are getting involved in other countries' business.
As far as I am aware, the Russian Federation is not a member of the European Union.
So on what grounds, then, are we interfering in the domestic affairs of this sovereign state?
The situation in Chechnya is certainly tragic.
However, war is always deplorable, in particular when it is started by seditionaries against the legitimate authority of a state.
Whatever upholders of humanitarian interventionism say, the operations carried out by the Russian forces in Chechen territory, and let us not forget that Chechnya is an integral part of the Russian Federation, are conducted by a regular army, under the authority of a democratically-elected president, and therefore concern the simple maintenance of law and order.
Unless Parliament wants to stand as a moralising policeman giving lessons to the whole world, it does not have the least authority to judge the behaviour of the Russian forces in Chechnya.
I have said this before and I repeat, today this Assembly is meddling in matters that do not concern it.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Since September 11 2001, in the name of the fight against 'terrorism', the Russian Government has stepped up its attack on the Chechen people.
A whole nation is thus being harassed and criminalised and the EU has shown no sign of condemning this.
The considerable importance of Russia on the world stage, the presence of oil and gas in the Caucasus and the fact that several oil pipelines pass through this area are perhaps the main reasons for the silence of the major powers with regard to Russia's policy in Chechnya.
The Russian Government has offered to allow the American forces to be present in central Asia.
The US army also has 200 military advisers in Georgia, with Putin's agreement.
The European Parliament must call on the Russian authorities to bring an immediate end to its 'cleansing' operation.
A cease-fire must be declared.
The Russian Government must resume negotiations with President Maskhadov's representative immediately and unconditionally.
The EU must let Russia know that the war in Chechnya is not compatible with the desire to build an open, transparent, democratic multi-ethnic society.
That is why I voted for everything that advocated this approach.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 2.03 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the resumption of the debate on the report (?5-0076/2002) by Mr GraÃ§a Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication on an ?U strategy towards China: Implementation of the 1998 Communication and Future Steps for a more Effective EU policy [COM(2001)265 - C5-0098/2001 - 2001/2045(COS)].
Mr President, our fellow MEP, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, makes valid points in many areas in his report, which is very much worth a read.
For example, it covers topics such as the situation of fundamental human rights in the Communist dictatorship which China still is, the brutal cultural genocide in Tibet and the instances of torture and death penalties on a large scale, also directed against political dissidents.
Surely there is no comparison with the situation in the United States of America which, nevertheless, was likened to that in China by another speaker this morning.
One thinks of the brutal threats to independent Taiwan and the total lack of freedom of expression. The list goes on.
When a list of this kind is included in this report, we should, in fact, also dare ask ourselves what the concrete or tangible result is of so many years of international and intense dialogue regarding human rights in the Communist dictatorship of China.
What improvements have actually been made in that region over the past few years?
Unfortunately, this is a rhetorical question.
It remains, therefore, unacceptable in my view that this dictatorship can count on so much tolerance and so much cooperation from the EU, but also from more or less the entire international community, even with regard to the organisation of the Olympic Games in 2008.
For example, I remember a few years ago that South Africa had to settle for far less understanding.
The protest is only verbal and is never backed up by any action.
I notice that when, in recent times, governments in Austria and Italy which were not to the liking of certain European opinion formers in, for example, my country took up office in entirely democratic ways, a number of boycott campaigns were actually launched.
The self-same conscience of the world falls silent, however, or only deals in words when China is involved, which is something I regret.
I wish to begin by welcoming Mr GraÃ§a Moura's report.
While I am not a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am one of the vice-chairmen of the Delegation for relations with the Peoples' Republic of China and so take a considerable interest in what is happening there.
From my perspective, the most significant development in China of recent years is the move towards China becoming incorporated into the world trading system.
Not merely is this significant, as it takes China into the world community of nations, it also brings China into the evolving new system of decision-making in an increasingly interdependent world.
I would like to make two particular points which arise from this.
First, for Chinese membership of the World Trade Organisation to be a success, it is necessary for legal certainty and even-handedness to apply to commercial relations between Chinese business and firms from outside.
If and when these relationships go wrong, and it is bound to happen from time to time, there is an overriding requirement for there to be in place proper legal processes to deal even-handedly and fairly with outstanding causes of disagreement.
I know that steps are being taken to enable this to occur and I very much support and welcome them because without them WTO membership cannot be a success.
Secondly, it is a characteristic of current developments in international relations that the traditional demarcation between domestic and foreign policy is breaking down.
Regardless of whether human rights issues in the past may have been treated as purely domestic considerations, increasingly now they are not.
Regardless of the situation in classical international law, these things are important to people outside China.
They will and do take them into account in making policy, be it political or commercial.
The same equally applies within the European Union.
How these aspects of life are handled domestically in China now has, and will continue in the future to have, repercussions on the way in which relations between China and both foreign countries and foreign businesses develop.
Mr President, we cannot overemphasise the importance of EU-China relations, which have developed significantly in recent years, as we all know, specifically in the areas of political dialogue, trade relations, and scientific and technological cooperation.
We must now step up these relations and extend them to other areas in a way that suits both parties.
The Commission communication, which warrants the support of Parliament, presents a strategic framework for such a process and proposes elements for practical action.
Along these lines, we also hope that account will be taken of the ideas put forward in the excellent report by our colleague, Mr Vasco GraÃ§a Moura.
Because of the limited time available to me, I shall emphasise only three aspects: in addition to cooperation in the fields of trade, industry and technology, made possible by China's recent accession to the WTO, cultural dialogue between Europe and China must be stimulated.
For example, the development of exchanges at university level is something we can easily achieve, specifically by extending the scope of the TEMPUS programme. Secondly, I wish to state that Macao and Hong Kong, in addition to being particularly important points of international contact in the economic and financial spheres, could also become centres of intense cultural exchange.
The success of these two autonomous regions will benefit China, but would also be important for Europe.
Apart from anything else, it could provide a good example of what can be achieved when international relations are geared towards peaceful interaction.
Lastly, the issue of human rights is still a matter of huge concern if we wish to deepen cooperation with China.
As the rapporteur states, we hope to see some more positive and more significant indications by China so that, by the time the 2008 Olympic Games are held, China's image on the international scene will be an entirely positive one.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group shares the rapporteur's opinion that it is of the utmost importance for both the EU and China to strengthen relations between themselves.
The EU can help a country such as China, with a population of 1 250 million and the world's seventh largest GDP, find its niche in the international community in terms of political, economic, social and cultural relations.
China's accession to the World Trade Organisation last November in Doha is of crucial importance.
It is now impossible for China to pursue political goals with economic sanctions, as it did before.
Accordingly, economic sanctions, such as those directed against the Netherlands as President of the EU in 1997 because it drafted a UN resolution about the human rights situation in China, are now a thing of the past.
China will need to observe the letter and spirit of the regulations of the World Trade Organisation.
As chairman of the Interparliamentary Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, I should like to underline that the European Parliament can play quite a substantial role.
In addition to the various summit meetings at government and official level, an open and transparent political dialogue between the European Parliament and the National People's Congress can help further develop democracy and respect for human rights in China.
The human rights situation in China has greatly deteriorated in the past year.
The increasing number of political executions spring to mind, as well as the ban on the Falun Gong movement and the recent escape of the Tibetan Karmapa Lama to India.
China must unconditionally observe the UN Treaty concerning civil and political rights which, after all, it signed itself.
Actual steps must be taken in order to ensure that this is done.
The European Parliament will continue to insist on democratisation and the observance of human rights in China and will also continue to devote attention to the problems involving Taiwan and Tibet.
A remarkable result was achieved two weeks ago during our dialogue with a delegation from the parliament of the Tibetan Autonomic Region in Brussels.
A pledge was made on this occasion that the Red Cross will be allowed to visit prisons and work camps in Tibet.
We welcome this with open arms and hope that this will actually be done.
In June, the China delegation will be visiting China and Tibet.
In this way, the European Parliament will be able to do its bit towards further strengthening relations with China, for we can learn a great deal from each other.
Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my congratulations to our rapporteur, Mr GarÃ§a Moura, but will only be speaking to the part of his report that deals with Tibet.
I have known Tibet for over twenty years, even its furthest-flung corners, and it must be borne in mind that Tibet is the largest highland area in the world, about as large as the whole of Europe between Gibraltar and the Urals.
Tibet possessed, and to some extent still does possess, an independent culture, religion and way of life, and it is now high time for the Council to appoint an EU Special Representative and for Tibet as a whole to achieve an agreed autonomy.
For not all is yet lost while the old culture still lives on the fringes of present-day Tibet, in Kham and Amdo, which are today no longer considered part of the autonomous province of Tibet.
The opening of negotiations between the central government and Beijing and within the government-in-exile in Dharamsala must be encouraged.
Nobody wants the old monastic state back, but Tibet can defend its culture as an autonomous region in China if human rights are guaranteed within it.
Let me close with something that is very close to my heart. Tibetans, both those in exile and those in Tibet, who have for 50 years used peaceful means to press for their rights, never resorting to terrorist actions of any kind, should not, in times like our own in which globalised terrorism predominates, be branded as terrorists, but are owed a tribute of respect for their peaceful approach.
Mr President, I wish to begin by offering my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr GraÃ§a Moura, for a very balanced report.
He has raised a number of issues which merit further consideration.
I agree with his observation that while the human rights dialogue could indeed be useful, unfortunately up to now it has not produced tangible results.
Human rights continue to be abused, political activity is suppressed and, according to Amnesty International, there were more State executions in China last year than in all other countries combined.
On the issue of Taiwan, I also condemn President Jiang Zemin's threats to use military force.
Only peaceful negotiations carried out in an atmosphere of mutual respect will bring about progress.
Furthermore, the cowardice of EU Member States in refusing a visa to President Chen Shui-bian to visit Europe is self-serving and counterproductive.
Turning to other matters, the EU needs to review how the 1989 arms embargo is being implemented, especially since Member States are being allowed to interpret the rules themselves.
In Ireland, for example, military goods can be exported to China, as long as they are not sold directly to the military.
There are no end-user checks in place to ensure that they do not end up in the hands of the military or security services for purposes of which the EU would strongly disapprove.
The UK continues to have a flourishing trade in British-made military goods.
As the rapporteur for Hong Kong, there are a number of issues about which I have concerns but I feel it is inappropriate to raise those concerns now.
I hope that in the very near future - possibly in the autumn - the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will take an initiative and we will have a much more comprehensive report to deal with the many concerns which this House and indeed I myself, as rapporteur, have relating to Hong Kong.
Mr President, whichever way you look at it, Mr GraÃ§a Moura's report is a good report, because it deals with questions of political strategy, leaving topical or daily issues out of the equation.
There have been huge changes in China over the last decade.
Ten years ago, we witnessed the dramatic events in Tiannamen Square; today we are witnessing a solution - of sorts - to the problem of both Macao and Hong Kong, improvements in Taiwan, involvement in the World Trade Organisation and, after Greece, the next Olympic Games in 2008, which all goes to show that progress has been made.

Does that mean that it is all good news?
By no means.
China is not doing at all well when it comes to human rights.
And it is not doing well it comes to human liberties.
However, when you evaluate questions of political strategy, you have to decide on a cut-off point.
And our cut-off point has to be a democratic China, a pole of stability in a multipolar, peaceful world.
And that is what our political strategy should be geared towards.
Accusations and one-sided relations do not bring about policies, which is precisely why the whole point of political strategy is to look to the future and not get bogged down in day-to-day issues.
Moderation, stable objectives and efficiency are the common ground for joint action in such cases.
China has worked with us in the fight against terrorism and that is a peak on its development curve.
Our relations are improving constantly and, more to the point, I hope that we shall have more improvements in the future.
Anyone meeting Chinese delegates nowadays will find a new generation of people, very young people, 30, 40, 50 at most, with a good level of education and a good grounding in world affairs and that is most encouraging.
China itself has found a formula for progress, calling the change 'market Communism' and shying away from the term 'market policy' in both economic and social relations.
That is how it is developing and I think that we should help it by persuading it to correct its bad points.
And there are a lot of them!
Nevertheless, we must not be subversive in our persuasion.
I think China is on the right path because, for better or for worse, it is one of the lucky countries, a lucky nation with a long history of culture and civilisation and the heritage to match.
And in the changes being made to the ideological and political values which every society craves for the sake of its own cohesion, China's history and culture carry great weight and, as far as I know, it is precisely these cultural elements which derive from Confucius, from humanitarian values and so on, which efforts are being made to restore as social values in China, which is a good thing because they will help bring about a balanced and humanitarian society.
Having said which, I trust that when we come to vote on Mr GraÃ§a Moura's report tomorrow, subject to a few improvements, we shall set the European Union's strategy towards China on the right political course.
Mr President, we have talked about China many times in this House, and it is excellent that there is now an extensive and overarching report on the EU's cooperation strategy for the region.
I want to congratulate Mr GraÃ§a Moura on a very sound report. It is a really good piece of work.
China is a huge country of growing importance in the world.
The consequences of the economic, social and political transformations faced by the country are unforeseeable.
In connection with China's membership of the WTO - supported by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party - there will be many opportunities for the EU and China to deepen their cooperation.
Economically, socially, culturally and politically, we must have an extensive dialogue with China.
WTO membership will make demands when it comes to software piracy, environmental issues, trade unions etc, and we can perhaps be of help.
It will be no surprise to you, Mr President, that the ELDR Group is very concerned about the issue of human rights.
We genuinely want to appeal to the Commission to increase the pressure on China where these issues are concerned.
Commentators throughout the world are agreed that the human rights situation is deteriorating overall.
It seems as if China, just like Russia in the case of Chechnya, is using the fight against terrorism as an alibi in order to commit atrocities against minorities.
The ability to practise one's religion freely in China is strictly limited.
Catholics report systematic persecution, and mosques are burned down.
In Tibet, there is severe oppression of the Tibetan people, especially of monks.
We are also anxious about the torture and persecution of democracy campaigners, trade union activists and dissidents, and the attempt to limit freedom of expression on the Internet is of course unacceptable.
The daily arrests, torturing and systematic persecution of Falun Gong practitioners is also very worrying.
Even though the Chinese regime appears resolved to break this movement, it will not succeed, and a dialogue must therefore be brought about on this issue.
China also executes more people than all other countries put together and, in this area, we must exert pressure in order to bring about a moratorium.
These issues must be given the highest priority in our cooperative relations with China.
We had hoped that there might not perhaps have been any 2008 Olympic Games in China but, now that these are in fact to take place, we must use them as a means of exerting pressure.
I have stood on this platform many times and talked about human rights in China, and many telephone calls have been received from the Chinese Embassy.
That will continue.
As long as there are Liberals in this House, we shall stand up for human rights in China.
Mr President, Commissioner, I can tell the Liberals that they will not be alone in this fight.
China has decided to join the World Trade Organisation.
This means that China has made a conscious choice in favour of openness, and this will not only be in the area of trade.
China will, as a result, go through major changes that will have a huge impact on society.
We will conduct that dialogue with that enormous country and we will need to build that dialogue not only on economic interests, but we will, through our electorate, through our values, through our institutions, founded on democracy and human rights, be forced to put this dialogue on an ethical footing, and it is useful to spell this out to the Chinese authorities from the outset.
We heard about the large-scale repression of Catholics and Muslims earlier on.
Without being familiar with any of the intricacies myself, I should like to warn against the large-scale repression of those who practise Falun Gong.
They are a peace-loving people who are thrown into prison in their thousands.
We have received blood-curdling accounts and testimonies on this score.
Human rights and international law are at the moment clearly the weak point; democracy will gradually take root in Chinese society and find its own way.
And the Chinese Government should not react to this with large-scale repression.
I should also like to mention the increasing concern we have in this Parliament for Tibet and for other regions in that giant country which are asking for a certain level of autonomy and which want to be able to go their own way, culturally speaking.
To respond to this simply with repression is criminal and, in my view, all those who in the near future have contact with the Chinese authorities should make it clear to them that we and our communities are not only concerned about money matters.
Mr President, Commissioner, unlike the lady who spoke before me, I am not sure whether membership of the WTO will automatically lead to political change in China, but that is something I shall return to shortly.
I think it was a good thing that the People's Republic of China joined the WTO.
It was not a straightforward thing for the Chinese to do, as it will mean major processes of internal restructuring for them, but I consider it urgently necessary from the point of view of China's interests that these processes of restructuring should start now.
I also believe that it represents a good starting point for an improvement in trading relationships.
I wish, though, to appeal to the Commission to keep a careful eye on how China meets the obligations it has entered into by joining the WTO.
The behaviour of China, which had made promises, for example to open up the insurance market, has not been very encouraging in recent years.
Promises were made, but attempts were made to evade them.
In this respect, I hope that China will give real and positive acknowledgement of what the consequences must be - and it would be interesting if the Commissioner were to make a statement on the line the Commission will take on this.
As regards political dialogue, my fellow Members have all made reference to the human rights issue.
These human rights apply universally; they are not European human rights that we want to enforce on China, but universally recognised human rights that we demand, and they include the rights of minorities, be they religious or cultural.
My fellow Members have already had something to say about Tibet.
I would like to take up another example, the persecution of the unofficial Catholic Church in China, which has to exist underground because the government does not recognise the Catholic Church which sees itself as linked to the Vatican.
That is not acceptable.
Turning to Taiwan, I hope that the People's Republic of China will open political dialogue without setting prior conditions.
It is only political dialogue of this kind that can lead to reunification, and then only if this is on the basis of human rights and of democracy in a constitutional state.
We in Parliament should play our part in promoting contact between the two states.
We should likewise maintain contacts with members of the parliaments in the People's Republic of China and in Taiwan.
Commissioner, I hope that the Commission will soon set up its office in Taipei, so that the Commission, too, may support dialogue between the two states by means of its missions in Beijing and in Taipei.
Mr President, the rapporteur has, in my view, presented an outstanding report which, in all its comprehensiveness, indicates the importance of relations with China and the importance of a fruitful dialogue with China.
In my view, the chairperson of the China delegation, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, has made some very valid points on this score.
Nevertheless, we must be careful in our relations with China not to avoid the truth.
The previous speaker has already alluded to this, as others have too. If the Chinese emperor is not wearing any clothes, then we should tell him.
This would not be the first time.
In common with some fellow MEPs, I am thinking, for example, of the situation with regard to Taiwan and the way in which we, and particularly our Foreign Affairs Ministers, deal with this situation as the European Union, for it is really hypocritical the way we go about this.
Take Taiwan's observer status in international organisations, say the World Health Organisation, which is now being discussed.
This situation is ridiculous.
As a democratic country, Taiwan should be able to take part in such organisations.
Surely Taiwan is not the PLO from the sixties and the seventies.
It is a country with which we have good relations, at a political level too, and which has experienced a tremendous, democratic development, yet it is being treated like a pariah.
This is unacceptable.
Why is it that an elected leader such as Chen Shin-lian was unable to receive his freedom prize here?
His wife was here, which was a feat in itself, but the man around whom everything revolved was absent.
This, while the Chinese leader is currently on a glorious tour of the European Union.
I welcome the fact that he is on this tour. This enables us to talk to him about what is happening, including the positive developments in China, but it remains a hypocritical situation.
For let us be clear about this: China does not meet one single democratic criterion.
Hong Kong is the most telling example where, recently, so-called 'elections', conducted in an entirely undemocratic way, were held for a new chief executive.
If that is the shape of things to come in Taiwan, should it form part of China again, then it is not very inspiring.
I should, of course, also mention the human rights situation over there, and in particular mention should be made of capital punishment.
Needless to say, it is absolutely impossible for us, as the European Parliament, to condone capital punishment but, unfortunately, China beats everyone hands down when it comes to executions.
Between April and July 2001, more than 1 700 people were executed, which is more than the combined total in the rest of the world during the previous three years.
The torture and abuse of suspects are also common practice.
In my view, it is useful to add these critical observations to this excellent report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, on the other hand, do not welcome Commissioner Nielson.
I do not know why he is here; China would not appear to be part of his remit.
In my opinion, Commissioner Nielson concerns himself too often with things which are none of his business - and I think he understands what I am trying to say - and so I do not know what he might have to contribute in this area.
Ladies and gentlemen, on the subject of this report, I want to say that, two hours ago, we adopted a document which is extremely critical of Israel and regarding which there were opposing positions in the House.
I voted against this document and I saw that, when it wants to, Parliament is capable of raising its voice.
Two hours later, Mr President, we are presented with a document on China, a country with 1.2 billion inhabitants which oppresses hundreds of millions of people, ethnic and cultural minorities and ordinary citizens who are advocates of freedom and democracy, yet Parliament is incapable of doing more than - in point 10 - timidly raising the issue of human rights, after making complimentary comments about China and its development, referring to trade with the European Union, of course.
We do not support this.
We radicals condemn this approach, we condemn these double standards of the European Parliament, which is 'forceful' or tries to be forceful with those who are in a position of weakness, as Israel is now, under attack from a ferocious terrorism which, again this morning - and nobody has mentioned the fact - caused at least eight deaths, the deaths of innocent people, of course, in an Israeli bus, and then, the same day, expresses its satisfaction with the dictatorial Chinese regime which is oppressing hundreds of millions of people, rewarding it with a blank cheque.
We condemn this behaviour.
We feel that Europe will only become great when it succeeds in adopting an unambiguous attitude towards human rights, the rights of individuals and the rights of minorities, and so we will not vote for a text which has been described as hypocritical, a view I share.
There are parts of the text such as the section relating to Taiwan which we support, but we reject the overall line it takes.
We feel that the message Parliament and the European Union send to that country should be very different.
The Commission welcomes Mr GraÃ§a Moura's report on the Commission's Communication on an EU strategy towards China.
I am very happy to note that overall Parliament and the Commission have reached similar conclusions on EU-China relations over the past three years and how they should develop in future.
Despite several differences on some important issues, the EU and China have reached, in the last few years, a wide understanding on areas where the development of their relations is mutually beneficial.
This has been amply demonstrated by the successful annual summits in 2000 and 2001, and, most recently, by Mr Patten's official visit to China which I will report on in the following remarks.
He was extremely well received, as a representative of the EU, wherever he went and had intensive meetings with President Jiang Zemin, the Deputy Prime Minister, Qian Qichen, five senior ministers and other policy makers.
All of his interlocutors spoke frankly and openly about EU-China relations.
Some strong messages he received during the visit were: a recognition of the increasing role of the EU in the world, an appreciation for the recent, rapid progress in EU-China relations; and a genuine will and commitment to continue the development of EU-China relations and cooperation at all levels.
During his visit, Mr Patten put across the messages that all EU Member States were committed to the EU's China policy, that not only had trade and investment cooperation been impressive, but also that very strong progress was being achieved in other bilateral and transnational areas of concern, for example immigration, the environment and science and technology.
Dialogues on regional and international issues, such as the Korean peninsula, ASEM, Afghanistan, and international terrorism were proving to be increasingly beneficial to both sides.
Returning to the report, I note that it rightly picks out the importance of the events of 11 September and the launch of the fight against international terrorism, and China's entry into the WTO.
These events will help define, to some extent, the parameters for EU-China relations in the international arena for the foreseeable future.
More specifically, like Parliament, the Commission welcomes China's support in the international fight against terrorism and China's undertaking to assist in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
The report congratulates China on its accession to the WTO and expresses support for China's continuing economic and social reforms.
We agree with this.
It took China 15 long years of arduous negotiations to join the WTO.
China also came a long way in that period.
From being a rather isolated, inward-looking, centrally planned economy with a slightly open door, it is about to remove - we hope - many of the remaining great barrier walls to free trade.
It is therefore that it has joined the WTO, but we will now need to ensure that China fully adheres to its commitments.
We also welcome the fact that WTO accession will accelerate reform, but are conscious that the required reforms will bring with them serious challenges because of unemployment, urban drift and so on. We will do all we can to help to assist China during this delicate transition.
The human rights situation in China has, in some respects, improved in the last few years, notably in the field of social and economic rights.
But we remain deeply concerned about the general human rights situation.
We remain committed to the human rights dialogue.
However, while we are conscious that the way ahead will be a long-term process, we nevertheless believe that improvements in political and civil rights are needed in China, also in the short-term.
Chris Patten raised human rights issues in detail during his visit, particularly with Foreign Minister Tang.
The report draws the attention of the Chinese Government to the importance of respecting and protecting the religious and cultural heritage of Tibet, and the identity of the Tibetan people.
Chairman Re Di, the leader of the delegation from the National People's Congress of the Tibetan Autonomous Region that visited Parliament last month - whom some of you met and also referred to today - gave assurances that the Chinese Government pays a lot of attention to the protection of minorities and to their religious freedoms.
We attach great importance to these issues and were happy to note these assurances, but we will of course continue to be vigilant about Tibet and will continue to call for a direct dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama.
Mr Patten also discussed these issues with Foreign Minister Tang and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen.
As regards the issue of our cooperation with China I will take the liberty of informing Mr Dell'Alba that we are cooperating at a level of about EUR 50 million annually.
We started from a traditional situation where we were funding quite a wide range of different activities.
We are now at a point that is quite important, having approved in the Commission on 1 March this year a country strategy paper which brings our cooperation with China into the same mainstream as our global development policy, and which, is the responsibility of the Commissioner responsible for development cooperation.
The future priorities of our cooperation in China will be support for the social economic reform process, sustainable development and environment, and the promotion of good governance, human rights and the rule of law.
We have singled out these issues from an analysis of what is needed in order to use our basic general principles of fighting poverty in a manner that fits China's situation.
Alongside the different aspects I have singled out here, there are several other issues to which we attach great importance, such as relations with Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and international issues such as global warming and illegal migration that, unfortunately, I do not have sufficient time to comment on today.
However, I welcome the report's reconfirmation that the EU has a profound interest in a stable, prosperous and open China, which embraces democratic practices, free market principles, human rights and the rule of law, and that the EU must pursue policies which will help China further its endeavours in this direction.
That is what we fully intend to do through our increased dialogues and cooperation across the board.
Lastly, I would like to reiterate the observation that for China some of our desired goals will take longer to achieve than others.
As ever, there is a Chinese proverb that neatly encapsulates this very point, which is: "You won't help shoots grow by pulling them up higher".
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0071/2002) by Mr Fatuzzo, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication 'Supporting national strategies for safe and sustainable pensions through an integrated approach' [COM(2001) 362 - C5-0012/2002 - 2002/2017(COS)].
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating the Commission, represented here by Mrs Diamantopolou, who I am afraid has to turn round in order to be able to hear me.
I would move to a different seat in front of her so that I could see her while I am speaking if I had more time, for I do not like to see her having to perform contortions.
That said, I would like to inform you that this report places on the table the issues and the importance of elderly people in Europe.
Without a doubt, there will soon be as many as 100 or 120 million people in Europe and, in the near future, in the enlarged Europe, and so this report concerns a very large number of European Union citizens.
I am stressing this because, when pensioners and elderly people stop working, I regret to say that they are considered by governments, particularly the Ministers for the Budget, no longer to exist, to be citizens of which there should be as few as possible in a country, to be people who are a burden on the public purse, whereas, clearly, we are all agreed that being old means having worked for a lifetime, having suffered for a lifetime and having built up everything around us.
It would therefore be appropriate for elderly people to be able to enjoy their lives more than young people.
I have to say that, in the meetings and discussions held within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with all the group representatives, there was complete consensus on the objectives: we all want Europe to do something, if possible, to improve the lot of pensioners.
It is extremely important that we do this first.
There may be some disagreement as to how we go about this, but that is democracy and it is the right way to address such important matters.
At this point, I want to focus, in particular, on the bone of contention.
It is better to get the bad news over with first, if possible, and I will therefore start by making it quite clear that I personally do not support the statement of the Barcelona European Council, which, in the space of a day, without warning - nobody expected it - called for the average working age of citizens throughout Europe, of workers throughout Europe, to be increased by five years by 2010.
Together with the opposition groups and, in particular, the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Cercas, among others, we have drawn up an amendment opposing this decision, on which the European Parliament was not consulted.
I must also say, moreover, that I am totally against this decision; two amendments have been tabled by a group on the other side of the House, opposing this decision, and I personally cannot do anything but vote for these amendments, for I feel that citizens should be able to continue working on two conditions.
What I mean is, after they have paid enough contributions for a pension and have worked for a sufficient number of years of their lives, people must only continue to work on two conditions: the first being that the decision to work is voluntary, in other words that they are not forced to work for 45, 50 or 60 years of their lives - and the Commission states this in its report - and the second, I would add, being that there are no young people out of work.
As long as there is a young person who is unemployed, I feel that the elderly who have been able to work and can now draw a pension should leave their jobs for the young people.
I have now run out of time but I reserve the right to continue in my explanation of vote on this report.
Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo.
To tell the truth, you have an excellent track record when it comes to explanations of vote!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur has mentioned that it was not exactly easy to draw up an opinion for Parliament.
It contains a diversity of ideas, and I would like to pick up two main points, which refer to the procedure involved.
I can see the danger in the open coordination process being conducted only by officials and so-called experts without public discussion.
This topic is far too important to be permitted to be left exclusively to a closed circle in which far-reaching options are decided on.
We MEPs must therefore be involved in this issue as representatives of the public interest.
I will take this opportunity to reiterate the demand that we should have an interinstitutional agreement on the method of open coordination.
In conclusion, addressing the Commission and the Member States, I will repeat that we must achieve definite progress on the problems that bear down on Europe's people.
Pensions are one example of these.
We need a speedy revision of Regulation 1408/71 on the coordination of social security schemes.
We need simple rules on the transferability of occupational pensions.
We need solutions to the taxation of occupational pensions, which cannot be founded on open coordination alone, so Parliament must be brought in to represent the interests of Europe's people.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Fatuzzo warmly for the report before us.
It is very important that, when citizens reach pensionable age, they can count on a reasonable and fair pension scheme, whether they live in Finland or in Portugal.
That applies to men and women alike. I should like to home in on this latter group and present three points which affect women, in particular.
First of all, the pension schemes must be designed effectively to prevent poverty and social exclusion.
In many of the current schemes, it is still too often the case that mainly older, single women live far below the poverty line.
Often, through their choice to devote themselves to their families and not to develop a professional career, they hardly have individual pension rights.
I would therefore expressly call on the Member States to review their schemes in such a way as to ensure that women, but also men who, through family circumstances, are not active in the labour market, are nevertheless able to build up individual pension rights.
Part-time work, mainly done by women, makes it difficult to accrue pension rights and, in this area too, there should be scope for building up additional rights.
Secondly, in its communication, the Commission notes that, in order to keep pension schemes affordable, it is essential for total participation in the labour market to increase, as Mr Fatuzzo pointed out a moment ago.
In Laeken, a target figure of 60% was mentioned for women by 2010.
An impressive target, but I would cast doubt on whether women, as is the case in some countries, would be prepared to increase their premium contributions for their pensions thanks to the so-called actuarial factors.
The fact that, statistically, they have a longer life expectancy should not lead to discrimination.
This is precisely where the principle of gender solidarity should come into play.
I call on the Member States to give due consideration to this point.
Thirdly, the Commission suggests using the open co-ordination method to back the national strategies, and this requires gender-specific data and indicators.
This too must be borne in mind.
Finally, for the future of an ageing Europe, it is of the utmost importance for safe, adequate and affordable pension schemes to be set up which guarantee that retired men and women can lead dignified and independent lives and can take a full part in social and cultural life.
Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are all aware that retirement provision with a secure future has become one of the greatest challenges to budgetary policy, social security provision, our policies in the social sphere, and hence to humanity, in our time. This is due to demographic developments, that is, the fact that the coming years will see around one-third of the population past pensionable age, and by reason of the fortunate increase in life expectancy.
We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are right behind the Commission in its three main proposals for doing everything possible in order to achieve an appropriate level of pension, to ensure the financial sustainability of public and private means of retirement provision and to modernise pension systems, so that, in future, they too will be able to offer security despite changed overall conditions.
We are always talking about a great deal of mobility and flexibility, and about the internal market.
Today, it must also be said loud and clear that mobility, flexibility and a functioning internal market presuppose social security - security for people when they are required to be mobile.
As a group, too, we are very clearly in favour of extending the three-pillar model, meaning public systems, occupational systems involving both employers and employees, and private or individual schemes.
What we are dealing with is the way in which all three pillars of the retirement provision system relate to each other.
The load cannot be left to rest on one pillar alone.
Reference should also be made in this context to the differing competences that we have at present.
Responsibility for the systems, for the way the pillars relate to each other, for tax law, for labour and social security law, falls on the nation states.
Responsibility for the internal market, for mobility, for cross-border activities, lies at the European level.
We therefore favour greater coordination, but not to the exclusion of politics and Parliament, bypassing us, as it were.
Yes to coordination, but with codecision for those with political responsibility and for the citizens' representatives.
We are responsible for occupational retirement provision, and on a cross-border basis.
This is an important aspect of the Action Plan for Financial Services.
Again, in the Barcelona Final Document, there is the call for the second pillar to be regulated also on a European level.
In July 2001, Parliament set out our position with over 460 votes.
To this day, we are waiting for the Council's Common Position.
Things have come to such a pass that the Commissioner responsible said yesterday, in an interview with the 'Financial Times', that he was withdrawing the Commission proposal, despite our calling on him for there to be a regulation in Europe, and even though Barcelona puts us under pressure of time.
Of those who are competent and bear responsibility, we demand that they do what they have undertaken to do and set themselves a time limit. Let them at last act, or else new reports and resolutions will not help us, for action will be dragging its feet on the way to the political objectives.
Do something, Council!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. My first request is addressed to you, Mr President.
I should first of all like to say that this report comes at least one month, maybe many months, too late.
This report should have been ready to take to the Barcelona Summit, where pensions were on the agenda.
Parliament has, as it is, such a modest role in the open method of co-ordination that we must urgently find ways in this Presidency of improving our response time as Parliament.
If not, we will lose any credibility in this debate.
I hope, Mr President, that you will be able to inform the Presidency of this and that you will also find a solution to the problem.
I should now like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Fatuzzo, for the fact that, in this report, he has consistently adopted Parliament's line and the views we expressed in the report by Mr Cercas Alonso, for that is very important for my group.
After years, the silence has at long last been broken in an important debate such as that on pensions.
Silence is a very relative concept.
For, since forever and a day, the ECOFIN Council has been working on pensions, but viewed from the angle of the Stability Pact and the broad economic guidelines and, thus, only from the point of view of the fundability of pensions.
It is therefore a huge achievement on the part of the Commission, the Social Protection Committee and my own Minister, Mr Frank Vandenbroucke, under the Belgian Presidency, to have placed this issue on the agenda whilst adding the social dimension.
For let us be quite honest: if we want to safeguard our European social model, if we want to preserve the solidarity between, and within, the generations in pensions, if we want pensions also to form part of a strategy against poverty and in favour of guaranteed income, then this debate should clearly be placed on a social footing.
Although this issue mainly falls within the remit of the Member States, that does not mean that we cannot reach agreement at European level about the social objectives of the pension system.
And this is why this report is so important, in my view.
My group is also of the view that the objectives are currently still vague and general, but this is exactly why we need reports of this kind in order to ensure that this open method of co-ordination becomes more concrete in years to come.
And I am therefore particularly anxious about, and particularly surprised at, the attitude of the GUE/NGL Group on the one hand, and that of the PPE-DE on the other which now - at this of all times - wants to back-track and scale down a number of our positions, not only on the open method of co-ordination, but also on the social objectives of the pension system.
This is really the limit.
If we champion rights in the second pension pillar, then I fail to grasp why we should not do so for the statutory pension systems.
This is, in fact, another cause of my concern.
I have the impression that some reticence has crept in recently in the Council too.
Following the panache that was displayed under the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies, I have the feeling that the Council under Spanish Presidency is taking a bit of a back seat.
And that, indeed, respite is being given to countries that do not have their pension plans ready and that no more work is being done on indicators which can make this open method of co-ordination more concrete.
And that moreover, Barcelona was merely a summit where some of the preparatory work was done.
Finally, let there be no mistake: my group too is convinced of the fact that more people will need to enter employment in order to make future pension schemes affordable.
But let us also be quite clear about these social objectives; let us spell out clearly that this is not about raising the statutory retirement age but about introducing incentives which encourage people to stay in the labour market and about a resolute fight against any form of age discrimination within the labour market.
I hope that we will be able to demonstrate in our vote that this is what this is all about for us.
And I also hope that the PPE-DE will not play any games with this open method of co-ordination and will join us in voting in favour of Mr Fatuzzo's report.
Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Fatuzzo on his report on a subject I know is close to his heart.
I have two points to make, and they are in actual fact the same two points Mr Kuckelkorn touched upon, one concerning the open method of coordination for pensions and the other concerning the internal market for supplementary pension schemes.
Open coordination, through which the Member States set common objectives and guidelines for future policy in the pensions area, analyse developments and exchange experiences, is in many ways a fruitful form of cooperation.
It is especially heartening that the debate on future pensions is no longer concerned only with national finances and with how expensive it will become over the next ten years because of the many pensioners.
It is a good thing that the Member States are talking together about how we ensure that good, secure conditions for pensioners can be afforded in the future.
However, I wish nonetheless to highlight the problem that exists with open coordination, namely the democratic deficit.
The objectives and guidelines agreed by the Member States for future pensions are initially drawn up by so-called 'high level' representatives in the shape of officials despatched by the governments of the Member States. The agreements are then confirmed by ministers of the Member States who, it must then be assumed, have popular mandates.
It is a case of having to 'assume' because there is no democratic debate on this matter here.
When we adopt legislation in the EU, there are public debates in the Member States, that is to say in the national parliaments.
There is a system for consulting special interest groups so that the politicians have an objective basis for making decisions.
Here in the European Parliament, we have our open debates so that the public can hear and understand what the arguments are behind our decisions and so that special interest groups can make their presence felt in the debates.
Open debate and this basis for decision-making are totally absent when countries cooperate by means of open coordination.
If we are serious about this cooperation and want to see it reflected in actual policy, then the doors must be thrown open when decisions are made concerning objectives and guidelines.
The national parliaments must be far more actively involved, and local authorities and special interest groups must play their part.
The European Parliament can also play a positive role in this cooperation, for it is in this context that we of course bring all cultures together and look at things in their overall context.
It cannot be emphasised enough that efforts must be made to democratise open coordination, and I would urge the Council to address this subject.
Cooperation on a subject such as future pensions, in particular, demands transparency, for this is a subject that deeply affects us all, and I believe that a lot of the fear concerning the possible implications of pension reforms could be exorcised through greater openness.
The second point I wish to mention briefly is that of calling upon the Council and the Commission to bring about the speedy adoption of the Directive on Supplementary Pensions.
It must, of course, be the right form of directive that we adopt.
We must avoid constricting rules that hamper existing schemes.
With that in mind, however, it is important to get things moving. By means of common rules, we can make life easier for employees in companies that operate across borders and can promote competition and efficiency on the part of pension providers.
Mr President, I also would to thank our rapporteur.
We all know that this is subject on which he feels very strongly - at last he has got his five minutes on it.
I would agree with much of what has already been said in this debate.
When we are looking at safe and sustainable pensions, it is a particular problem for women.
There is a very strong gender dimension to the pension issue.
We see many severe disparities, especially in relation to occupational pensions and even State pension entitlements, where women are effectively penalised for taking on domestic responsibilities; for having worked part-time or flexibly.
As new working patterns become more common, it is clear that we need to ensure that pension provision is guaranteed for both men and women in those different working environments.
Perhaps, as is usually the case, once more men start working flexibly, we will suddenly see much more interest in pensions keeping up with different forms of work.
That is maybe cynical if truthful.
It is also, as Mr Van Lancker has said, an issue, which touches very strongly on poverty.
We already see in far too many countries, pensioners with an inadequate basic pension unable to participate fully in society and often unable to meet their basic needs.
The key, of course, is decent State pensions, and funding them is a political choice.
My group does not believe that pension costs will necessarily destabilise economies or society, if such choices on spending are made carefully.
Indeed, the cases of people playing by the rules and investing either in their companies - with the Enron example before us or indeed in Equitable Life in my own country - and making private pension provision, show that you cannot trust the markets any more than you can sometimes trust governments.
The democratic deficit in open co-ordination is also becoming even clearer.
This is obviously an issue we need to address extremely rapidly.
Mr President, the backdrop of the debate on the development of pensions systems is the new demographic context in Europe, a true challenge which has arisen due to the constant increase in the number of people reaching retiring age, which is linked to rising longevity.
In this context, the Commission and the Council have often called for pensions system reform in the name of the Stability and Growth Pact and combating state deficits.
Whilst national competence with regard to pensions is not called into question, the open method of coordination, an integrated approach serving national strategies aiming to ensure safe and sustainable pensions, is being proposed and this is the subject of Mr Fatuzzo's report.
We must find out the reason for this type of cooperation and how the objective of safe and sustainable pensions will be achieved.
The issues of retirement age, guaranteed rights, the payment of pensions, in other words, retirement conditions, are all the more sensitive as they arise at the end of a lifetime of professional and human endeavours and are a guarantee of positive relations of mutual support between generations.
It is good that Mr Fatuzzo's report recognises that the debate on pensions must not be restricted to financing problems, but that rights must also be guaranteed.
It is also good that he proposes to strengthen the open coordination method by democratic will, involving NGOs, the social partners, the candidate countries and the European Parliament in defining effective indicators and mechanisms with a view to assessing reforms and achieving modernisation.
However, the report does support the Commission's basic plan for a universal pensions system, although it waters them down by asking for collective systems of funded pensions to be promoted over individual financial pension and savings schemes.
I do not know whether that will answer Mrs Van Lancker's question, but the report basically supports the Commission's desire to move towards more ad hoc reserve pension funds and not to use state spending within the framework of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.
Nevertheless, we are all thinking about the Barcelona European Council which called for Member States to raise the retirement age by five years by 2010.
Clearly, the question of financing arises.
The development of the contributory system cannot be considered in the new demographic context without an increase in funds.
That would be irresponsible.
New resources must therefore be found.
We believe that there should be greater focus in two areas: the development and creation of quality employment for new contributors, and alongside that, making financial income subject to social security contributions at the same rate as wages and salaries, as advocated by an amendment tabled by my group.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Fatuzzo on a report on which he has certainly worked with passion and on his devotion to the subject over many years.
The report certainly has good points.
For instance, I especially welcome the emphasis placed on the link between the labour market and social protection.
As long as rigid labour markets prevail in Europe, as long as employment rates, particularly among the youngest and oldest members of the active population, are prevented by corporate and protectionist policies from rising above their current low levels, as long as the labour market is organised in this way, it will be difficult or even impossible to guarantee to today's and tomorrow's pensioners conditions which are both dignified and sustainable in the medium and long term.
I feel, however, that certain points need further emphasis.
The issue of pensions is not an easy question to deal with, and it is not one that can be resolved without cost.
There are legitimate, quite specific interests involved.
There are interests that are protected and interests that are not.
On the one hand, we have powerful lobbies - and quite rightly so - including politicians and pensioners who vote, who belong to trade unions, and on the other, we have a lobby which has absolutely no power at all because it does not vote and does not belong to a trade union, namely the younger generations.
I feel that the arguments surrounding the issue of pensions are first and foremost - for that is how things are - representative of a battle of interests between generations.
At this stage, it is the poorly represented younger generations who are losing the battle, and who should be represented differently in Parliament and, I feel, in this report.
The labour market and pension reforms were intended to avoid the explosion of this intergenerational dispute.
There are few guidelines to be followed for the reforms that are necessary, the first certainly being the need to raise the retirement age limit.
We are familiar with population trends, life expectancies and the quality of life of elderly people, and so we must not continue to work with pension parameters that were appropriate maybe thirty or forty years ago.
In conclusion, Mr President, we need to eliminate corporate privileges and make increasing use of second- and third-tier funded schemes, leaving public welfare expenditure with the sole task of guaranteeing the minimum level.
All the rest must be entrusted to funding mechanisms.
Mr President, I in turn would like to thank Mr Fatuzzo for his report, presented as always with a great deal of passion, which is situated in a demographic context, as indeed the United Nations Secretary-General has just emphasised at the Second World Assembly on Ageing, currently being held in Madrid.
He reiterated on this occasion that in 2040, there will be more people in the world who are over 60 years old than there will be under fifteen.
The forecasts for European demographic change are even more significant, as 40% of the European population will be 65 or over in 2025, according to Eurostat.
Therefore, the consequences for the balance of pensions systems, in particular, of this ageing of the population - which is in fact an undeniable sign of progress in terms of health and social aspects - give cause for concern, as the current proportion of four workers to one pensioner will only be two workers to one pensioner in 2030.
That is why the European debate particularly welcomes the Commission's communication, which aims to guarantee safe and sustainable pensions through an integrated approach to the strategies of the Member States, whose pension schemes, especially state schemes, are managed at national level.
It should be noted that many countries of the European Union have begun to take bold steps to perpetuate their pensions systems.
This is not the case of the French Government, which has not implemented the urgent and essential reforms, and, what is more, the national debate with which we are faced in France is evidence of this.
What I would like to point out here, in particular by referring to the Fatuzzo report, is that although the organisation and financing of state pensions must remain the responsibility of the Member States, the open coordination method proposed in this field by the Gothenburg Council should certainly encourage national reforms and enrich them with experiences of other States.
In this regard, Commissioner, we look forward to the presentation of the first national plans in the autumn, while insisting once again that the European Parliament should be more closely involved in this procedure.
Also from this perspective, unlike others, I am delighted that the Barcelona European Council of 15 and 16 March 2002 committed, on the one hand, to stepping up efforts to provide mature workers with greater possibilities of remaining in the job market, for example by means of flexible gradual retirement programmes and guaranteeing genuine access to education and life-long training, and, on the other, to gradually increasing the average retirement age in the European Union by about five years by 2010.
It seems to me that we should be able to offer, in the current context, an approach of free choice, based on employees' individual careers and their various life stages, which sometimes require them to keep working past retirement age, as obligatory retirement can lead to an immeasurable waste of human resources.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a big day for Mr Fatuzzo, as the pensioners' ambassador par excellence.
The main aim of today's report is in fact to investigate how we can help national pension systems achieve the three basic objectives of retaining their capacity to achieve the social objectives which they have set, staying financially viable in the long term and responding to society's changing needs.
To put it plainly, they are being asked to adapt without reducing the level of protection or standard of services which they provide.
Consequently, as our political group sees it, collective state pensions systems still take priority over purely private systems and are still one of the main ways of redistributing wealth, which is why they must continue to be funded by society as a whole.
As I see it, the amendments proposed by the PPE-DE undermine this basis and the balance struck in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Proposing that only health care and social protection should be funded from the state budget, with workers' pensions paid for solely out of workers' and employers' contributions, does away with any notion of solidarity.
Similarly, expecting Member States to include the positive impact which reducing the pension burden on contributions would have on the cost of labour and increasing pro rata contributions would have on auxiliary pension funds in their strategies means, to all intents and purposes, that the entire burden of pensions is shifted on to the workers.
On the contrary, the whole point of the reform should be to broaden the base of contributors and extend alternative forms of funding.
Likewise, the proposal to ensure the reforms are democratically legitimate, by giving the European Parliament a more active role in commenting on national strategy reports and indicators to evaluate results and by extending the social dialogue to include representatives of pensioners, non-governmental organisations and women's organisations, is fundamental to the success of the reform process, which is why I feel that Amendment No 17 should be withdrawn.
Mr President, it is a pity that our opinion is only being submitted after Barcelona, thus limiting the scope of tomorrow's vote.
At Barcelona, the Council set itself the objective of increasing the retirement age by five years by 2010, without any conclusion from Parliament or the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the subject, and, most importantly, without taking account of the expectations of the citizens and the social partners, for whom this idea is completely unacceptable.
The European Union, which is not competent to decide on matters of social protection but which, in fact, is exercising this competence in the name of establishing the single market in funded pensions, should play a greater part in extending the public debate on the future of pensions.
How should this be done?
First of all, by noting, as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done, that this is essentially a social challenge with financial aspects, and not the other way round.
Second, this challenge will only be taken up if we accept that the determining factor will be the employment rate rather than population ageing.
We already knew that pension funds do not affect the key choices that have to be made by society: what is this question? What is this choice?
What proportion of overall wealth do we want to allocate to pensioners?
In the past, we upheld the contributory pension system as a collective system of inter-generational support that creates a social link.
Now, we should be completely immune to capitalisation, in view of the Enron affair and the situation of British insurers who are begging their clients to use contributory pension services.
For many companies, employment remains a factor in cost adjustment.
The oldest workers, who are also the best paid, often pay the price of company exclusion policies.
Under these conditions, we cannot pretend to be astonished that those under threat of unemployment and poverty choose early retirement.
An entirely different goal would be necessary in order to achieve modernisation that takes in to account developments in work and life stages and to create a genuine right to gradual retirement.
Mr President, one of the central issues in the whole approach to the social security system is the need to ensure that the new method of open coordination guarantees the right to pensions that enable pensioners to live a dignified and independent life and does not impose reforms on the system that are designed to privatise it, albeit partially, and I am referring here specifically to pensions funds.
It is certainly important, as stated by the rapporteur, Mr Fatuzzo, that we guarantee the right to adequate pensions, regardless of the problem of financing, and avoid the risk of making workers and pensioners responsible for any imbalances in pension systems, since maintaining a fair system is more a problem of distribution than of demographics. It is, therefore, important that we guarantee a public and universal social security system, which is able to combat poverty and maintain a satisfactory standard of living for all pensioners, as we proposed in the amendments we tabled.
It is not acceptable that, on the pretext of the budgetary consolidation stipulated in the Stability Pact, we move towards laying down rules and recommendations which, in practice, threaten the right to pensions that enable pensioners to lead a dignified and independent life and to participate in social and cultural activities.
Hence the importance of expanding the base of contributors, of exploring alternative forms of financing statutory pension systems, for example, by extending social contributions to financial profits, and by conducting a thorough review of some legislative initiatives, specifically the directive on the activities and prudential supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision.
Of equal concern is the approach outlined by the Council in the conclusions of the Barcelona Summit, proposing a progressive increase of around five years in the effective average age at which people stop working in the European Union by 2010.
We are opposed to any attempt by the Member States to take the Council conclusion to be a starting point for increasing the legal retirement age or for extending the periods in which contributions are made in order to acquire full pension rights.
We therefore hope that the proposals we tabled are approved so as to improve the content of the report.
Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mr Fatuzzo on his report.
When he first came into this House and made his maiden speech, he spoke about the rights of pensioners and the duty that each of us had towards them for the future.
A lot of people derided him or laughed at him because of what he had said.
However, all I can say to Mr Fatuzzo is: "veni, vidi, vici".
The issue of pensions, future contributions and necessity of securing pensions, is partly financial, no matter what anybody says.
Of course, first and foremost, we have a social obligation and social concern for the most vulnerable within our society.
Unless we put in place a proper financial model and basis for securing universal pensions for all, the system is bound to fail because of demographics and other priorities that may arise.
I think that each of us has to come to this debate and to this argument from the basis of guaranteeing maximum opportunities for employment, maximum opportunities for social protection and maximum opportunities for forward-planning with regard to pension needs.
Many people have spoken about how best we can deal with this.
I would point Members to the example of Ireland, my own country, where over recent years, we have been putting aside one percent of gross national product to deal with future public pension provision for the year 2025 and onwards.
We do not have the same demographic problem in Ireland as there would be other countries, but we have taken that decision now, even though at the moment we could use the money for other things: infrastructure and so on. But we have given that commitment.
That is one of the issues that has to be looked at: making a tough long-term political choice rather than a short-term political choice with regard to how we use funding.
The final point I will make, Mr President, is that I agree with the rapporteur when he says that the pension system should include individualisation of pensions, social security and taxation systems.
However, we should be opposed to a harmonised and uniform system across the Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Carlo Fatuzzo on his excellent work, and in particular on his efforts to introduce the many amendments suggested.
In my view, the stereotype of old age has itself become old and outdated. It bears no relation to contemporary society.
If asked to think of someone aged 60 or 65, one does not conjure up a picture of a decrepit individual whose physical and mental capacities are significantly impaired.
That longer life span, extending well beyond the age of 65, represents a considerable achievement as regards culture, society, health and economics.
Nonetheless, this achievement may become a problem if we fail to appreciate its deeper meaning and adapt accordingly. It is important to take advantage of its full potential.
It has been said that ageing is the most far-reaching social phenomenon of the beginning of this century.
As Mrs Hermange already stated, the ratio between the potentially active population and that over the age of 65, currently 4 to 1 in many Member States, will become 2 to 1 towards the year 2050.
It is essential to adjust to such changes so as to minimise their negative aspects.
Achievements in the areas of culture, society, health and economics mean senior citizens should be able to enjoy a good quality of life at that age too, and society should benefit from their experience and wisdom.
It will therefore be necessary to provide for a combination of public pensions and offer older people the opportunity to work if they so wish. Flexible working patterns and equal opportunities are very important in this connection and need to be promoted.
Women often work on a part-time basis, or may have done so in the past. Sometimes they join the labour force later in life, or return to it after perhaps bringing up a family.
I believe the best approach is an open method of coordination.
This makes it possible to approximate legislation on social matters between Member States.
It also makes it possible to ensure that these people do not endure poverty at that stage of their lives. In addition, it facilitates mobility by recognising that pensions can be exported, as stated just recently at the Barcelona Council.
Further, it also allows the skills of the so-called third age to be put to good use through social ventures and voluntary work, though not exclusively in these areas. Above all, it means senior citizens can be encouraged to be actively involved in the workplace, by promoting the policy of gender equality, as I said earlier.
Mr President, this Parliament is today debating a subject related to an issue that is of concern to everyone.
At this very moment, the second United Nations World Assembly on Ageing is taking place in Madrid.
I therefore congratulate Mr Fatuzzo on having drafted this report, which highlights just how crucial it is that we come up with a solution to the problem of the future sustainability of pensions systems.
The European Union is facing an enormous challenge in the forthcoming decades as a result of the increased ageing of the population, which is related to the falling birth rate and to greater life expectancy.
The ageing of the population and the reduction in the number of people of working age requires innovative and effective policies to be drafted and implemented.
It is crucial that the Member States of the European Union undertake a speedy reform of their pension schemes, which will require changes in the organisation of labour, the creation of more and better jobs, specifically for older people, and a redrafting of demographic, birth and immigration policies.
If it takes too long to implement these reforms, as the rapporteur states, the European social model and the growth and economic stability of the European Union will suffer serious consequences.
In this field, one of the most important measures is the promotion of policies that foster the idea of active ageing; in other words, every citizen must have the option to retire or to remain in the labour market on a full or part-time basis.
Incentives must therefore be provided for later retirement, lifelong learning must be promoted and health systems must be improved.
Legislation regulating social security systems falls within the sole competence of the Member States, as we all know, which explains the considerable differences between these systems.
The importance of this issue and its economic and social effects, however, require a global approach and global strategies.
The European Union must, therefore, play a leading role in supporting national strategies, by means of an open method of coordination, setting common objectives and working methods, and by promoting the exchange of experiences and of good practices in addition to undertaking an ongoing and coherent evaluation of the progress that has been made.
Another aspect that should be emphasised is the considerable proportion of elderly people in the Member States who are victims of poverty and social exclusion.
Pension schemes must contribute to eliminating such problems and to maintaining standards of living that are worthy of the third age.
Lastly, I feel obliged to state that current pension schemes are particularly unfavourable to women, and the Member States must, therefore, give priority to gender equality and European legislation that effectively guarantees the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender in pension schemes must be promoted.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one disputes that the subject of today's debate lies at the heart of one of the biggest challenges facing the European Union if it is to update its social model and achieve the Lisbon objectives.
And the size of the challenge is matched by our responsibility at European and national level to achieve these targets and reform our pension systems.
Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Commissioner, supports your efforts to highlight the importance of these reforms and their financial as well as their social implications and it supports the initiatives being taken to coordinate pension policies through joint objectives, joint working methods and joint monitoring and evaluation of the progress made.
We maintain that these policies must be cohesive and must complement coordinated policies on employment, social exclusion and poverty.
Because these policies are so sweeping and so important to Europe both now and in the future, they have to be democratic and they have to increase the involvement of the social partners and of social and regional agencies and women's organisations because these social reforms are particularly important to women; and, come what way, the method of open coordination must guarantee that the European Parliament is fully involved.
But that alone is not enough.
The reforms needed will only be viable if they are supported by the whole of society.
Public opinion is unprepared and uninformed.
I think the European Commission urgently needs to organise information campaigns in liaison with the national governments and social partners.
This is particularly important in Member States which have neglected or do not have the courage to implement suitable reforms and in order to prepare the candidate countries.
I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Fatuzzo, on a serious and detailed report which has our full support.
Mr President, to our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - less so, though, to our highly-committed rapporteur, Mr Fatuzzo, who was sent to Parliament by the Italian Pensioners' Party - I would like to say that less would have been more.
That, though, is the fault of - among other things - the over 200 amendments that our rapporteur had to deal with, the final result of which is the interminable resolution containing the relevant and the irrelevant along with, unfortunately, several contradictions and repetitions.
Despite that, this report is important because we indeed do not want to be left out of the European dialogue on safe pensions, not least because of the effects that unsustainable pension schemes could have on the value of the euro, quite apart from the pensioners' standard of living.
If the euro is weak, we all suffer from it.
Time means that I must, unfortunately, limit myself to a few fundamental principles. One is that, even if the decision-makers at national level retain responsibility for pension systems, it is still for the EU to call on them to introduce in due time reforms to secure the long-term sustainability of their systems, in order to guarantee pensions that are adequate and safe.
It is for that reason that one should also welcome the Commission's effort to monitor and promote these processes of reform through more in-depth cooperation between the Member States and on the basis of an open method of coordination.
We can agree to the three guidelines on safe and sustainable pensions, as endorsed at Gothenburg.
We may therefore expect the Member States to help to bring about a consensus capable of sustaining them in the solution of their common problems.
We know that reforms of the pension systems have been introduced too hesitantly in various Member States, because they shrink from politically unpopular decisions.
We therefore hope that the non-binding method of open coordination can contribute to the setting of common objectives and to speedily turning these into national policies.
As a woman - and, having been the youngest Member by far in 1965, I have since, unfortunately, become the oldest female in this House - I of course welcome the call, in the communication from the Commission, for pension systems to be examined with a view to their modernisation, with priority being given to the removal from all three pillars of all existing discrimination on the grounds of gender.
That should have been done long ago in view of the directives from the 1970s on the equal treatment of women and men, which are still current.
The Member States must of course ensure that women, and also house-husbands, who are for family reasons not represented in the labour market, as well as spouses who help out in family businesses, get opportunities to accrue individual pension entitlements.
I would like to make particular reference to the spouses helping in businesses; there is a report on them by me dating back to 1995, and the Commission has still not yet responded to it.
Mr President, if you would allow me, as the oldest woman in this House, to say something further, it will be to those who have today resisted the idea that we, in view of our longer life expectancy should, of course, be able voluntarily to work for longer.
I would like to add to that that they should perhaps take me as an example of how work and commitment are excellent ways of preventing premature ageing.
Mr President, Commissioner, the speech we just heard was in fact an excellent bridge to mine.
Mrs Lulling represents my older female colleagues here, whereas I am the youngest female member of the PPE-DE Group.
I can fully endorse what Mrs Lulling said in her speech just now.
This shows that there is no generation gap in the European Parliament at least.
If the post of EU liaison officer for senior citizens were to be created the rapporteur, our colleague, Carlo Fatuzzo, would be the most likely candidate for the job.
I am sure that young people in Finland, at least, would support his election.
The way in which he devotes himself to his work is unequalled.
Pleasantries aside, however, Mr Fatuzzo has focused his efforts on defending the interests of senior citizens in Europe.
For several decades he has had professional experience of elderly people's issues, which is also evident from this thorough and very professionally prepared report.
The report is based on significant social phenomena.
The growth in the number of pensioners, which is due to increased life expectancy and relatively early retirement, will eat away at the funding of the present pension schemes unless essential and sufficiently radical reforms are implemented in good time.
We need solutions at both national and Union level.
There are such considerable differences between pension systems in the various Member States that the responsibility for regulating the organisation and funding of statutory pensions must be that of the Member States alone in the future also.
At Union level we can participate, instead, in defusing the pensions bomb by promoting the development of cross-border personal pension and savings schemes. Firstly, these will be sustainable in terms of their financing; secondly, they will provide the capital companies need in the form of investments; and thirdly, they will serve the changing needs of individuals better than universal statutory schemes.
Unfortunately, the Member States are shrinking from making the decisions necessary for all this to come about.
The drafting of the directives on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision in particular has been painfully slow.
It is hardly far-sighted to bury one's head in the sand.
Like my colleagues, I too urge the Council to face up to the challenges of our population growth at long last and take the necessary decisions, while Spain still holds the Presidency, that would enable institutions that offer supplementary occupational pensions to operate constructively in our internal market.
The guarantee of a secure old age has played a key role in different cultures throughout the ages and all over the world.
Care of the elderly is a yardstick of a civilised society.
Making the decisions in good time is above all in the interests of the younger generation as every wasted day increases the costs of reform and aggravates the problem.
Mr President, I should like to bring a slightly different dimension to the debate and bring in the experience of Parliament's Committee on Petitions where pensions and social security issues constitute 20% of the petitions brought to the committee's attention.
I add my own congratulations to Mr Fatuzzo and his own way of pressing the needs of pensioners.
Pensioners across Europe have reason to be grateful to him for the work he has done.
The issue that tends to be raised most with the Committee on Petitions is increasingly that of people who in their working lives exercise their right to move across and work in various countries in Europe and then retire elsewhere.
I well remember the case of a German citizen, married to a French woman, who had spent much of his working life in Belgium, had then retired to Spain and wanted to know who was going to help him in filling in his pension claim forms.
There was also an Italian citizen who worked much of his time in Luxembourg and then retired to Italy.
He pointed out that the arrangements (in place at the time) made it possible to accumulate benefits, but nevertheless penalised migrant workers who found themselves having to deal with any number of national pension schemes.
In another case earlier this year we considered a petition from a British citizen, on behalf of 40,000 British pensioners living in Spain, who complained that the British Government was refusing to pay them the winter fuel allowance.
His argument was that it was paid to all pensioners living in Britain, regardless of means, regardless of how cold or warm it was in the part of Britain they lived in.
I represent the Isle of Wight - the sunniest part of the United Kingdom - but the same winter fuel allowance is paid to people living in the cold north of Scotland; the British Government refused to pay this to the UK citizens in Spain.
These citizens appealed to the European Parliament and I am delighted to say that as a result of that petition, the winter fuel allowance is now to be paid to British pensioners wherever they live.
The point I make is that British pensioners have to look to the British Government, German pensioners to the German Government and so on.
I do not disagree that it is the responsibility of national governments, but the point that needs to be made, is that more and more thousands of citizens who are pensioners, who work in different countries in Europe, will retire to different countries in Europe.
It is very important that the Member States that have responsibility for pension schemes bear in mind the needs of citizens who use their European rights to work and retire in different countries of the Union.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Fatuzzo's report paints an unvarnished picture of the thoroughly problematic retirement provision situation in all the European Union's Member States, in particular of the problems that already exist, and will certainly get worse in the future, in financing the national systems for providing pensions and other benefits.
It is quite beyond dispute that the EU needs to be active in this area as well as in others and to make its contribution to a possible solution of these problems, but it must do this within the framework of the legal bases in the Treaty establishing the European Community.
Social security systems differ very widely from one EU Member State to another.
More so than nearly all other legislative areas, they have grown from historic roots and have therefore evaded harmonisation of any kind at the European level.
My criticism is directed at the method of so-called open coordination for pensions that the Council has introduced, a method that the Fatuzzo report welcomes.
This procedure would lead to the European Union appropriating for itself, without any basis in the Treaties and, so to speak, cold-bloodedly, a legislative authority that belongs to nations.
Council resolutions cause Member States to subject themselves to ever more restrictive and more detailed demands, the result being a quasi-legal obligation and liability.
We have, indeed, already been able to observe this development in the area of policy on the labour market and employment.
We are in favour of a clear demarcation of legislative competences between the EU and the Member States, that being the only way to guarantee the citizens of Europe comprehensibility and transparency, in short, legal clarity.
In addition, the most fatal side effect of what is termed open coordination is that the only institution of the European Union to have any democratic legitimacy, namely Parliament, is completely sidelined.
The Council has announced the extension of open coordination to other highly sensitive areas such as health provision and care for the elderly.
It is therefore high time for Parliament to show the Council where the lines are drawn and take a position on this, above all in defence of its own interests.
The CSU delegation within the European People's Party, because of its substantial misgivings about open coordination, will not be voting in favour of the Fatuzzo report.
I would like to see wide-ranging discussion on this issue in Parliament in the future - with specific reference too to the legislative work of the Convention.
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Fatuzzo for his report and to express my admiration for his enthusiasm and staying power on the subject of the reform of pensions systems.
Monetary Union and the increasingly integrated economic policies of the Member States of the European Union undeniably give all policies a European dimension, even policies which were strictly national until just a few years ago.
In December, both the ECOFIN and the Social Affairs Council agreed on joint objectives and working methods for pensions.
The fact that both Councils - both ECOFIN and the Social Affairs and Employment Council - are taking an equally categorical and focused approach to the issue of pensions is an important political step.
As we have said time and again in this Chamber, this is not an economic issue, it is a social issue with economic implications.
In today's report, Parliament has, I think, put an optimistic foot forward on the road to cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, a new, ambitious programme of cooperation on the subject of pensions.
The Commission presented its report on pensions in June 2001.
Let me reiterate what transpires from both the Commission report and the European Parliament report, because I think it is important.
Pension systems cannot be reformed in a vacuum.
This issue does not impinge on just one type of legislation.
It impinges on a set of policies whose repercussions will be felt by the pension systems.
I need only mention policies to resolve Europe's demographic problem.
The demographic problem was initially aired at the Madrid conference on the ageing population, which discussed the twin problems of the rise in life expectancy and the European countries' inability to make up their populations.
A second important chapter is employment and I would remind you of the important steps taken by the European Council on specific objectives and on the involvement of older workers in the job market.
There is an important point to be made here.
We cannot simply focus on increasing age limits, justified as they are by the rise in life expectancy and economic problems.
No, that is not enough.
We also need to present and implement a set of policies to keep and motivate older workers to stay in the job market.
It is extremely difficult for people over 50 to stay in or find work in numerous industries in the private sector.
So we need investment and specific policies in the employment sector to train these people and to ensure that the education system and the training system commit to specific quotas for older people.
Policies on poverty and social exclusion also need to be mentioned here.
Several Members defined the connection between policies on poverty and the reform of the pensions systems and the Commission is currently working on new indicators for pension adequacy in relation to data on poverty.
Ladies and gentlemen, the question of pensions is, of course, a question of national policy; in numerous countries it is a question of regional policy.
The European Union has no desire - and it would, I think, be impossible - to intervene in national systems or issue guidelines as to which is the best system and which is the worst.
However, it is clear, both for reasons of mobility - several members referred to numerous new problems with worker mobility in the European Union - and because there are common causes for the problem of viability, that there is a need for cooperation.
This need appears to be met by the method of open cooperation.
This method is a new tool which we have tried in policies on employment and policies on poverty and exclusion and now we are really putting it to the test with pensions.
Are there democratic lacunae?
Indeed there are!
Is there more room for cooperation with Parliament?
Indeed there is!
I should like, if I may, to reiterate where exactly the European Parliament fits into the method of open cooperation on employment.
Every year Parliament's presence is more keenly felt, greater account is taken of its proposals and it has a very important role in the application in question.
The cooperation method on pensions has only just begun.
In September, the Member States will submit their first reports.
Parliament will be able to contribute to the Commission's joint report.
And may I say I have no objection to sending all the reports to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, so that we can really work together right from the start.
Finally, two issues with a European and a specific dimension.
The first is the dimension of gender equality which, because of the acquis communautaire and European legislation, have to be mainstreamed in all reforms.
The second, as has quite rightly been stressed, is that enlargement and the candidate countries must be included in any plans.
The conference which you have organised in May with authorities from the candidate countries is a good starting point for cooperation, given that the candidate countries will have to take part in this joint exercise in two years' time.
I think the agreed joint report with its three basic lines of approach and eleven points which all the countries must use as a basis for reform contains two important victories: the first is that the economic and social dimensions sit side by side and the second is that it gives maximum European added value to national policies.
The next item is the report (A5-0091/2002) by Mrs DamiÃ£o, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 83/477/EEC, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work (COM(2001) 417 - C5-0347/2001 - 2001/0165(COD)).
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission and by saying that this initiative can be criticised only for its lateness and for the modesty of its ambition.
Nevertheless, it has the merit of focusing on the groups of workers currently at greatest risk and also of including sectors that it would have been quite unjustifiable to exclude, such as the shipbuilding and aeronautical industries.
The Commission rightly affirms the need to expand protection for workers who are subject to risks of asbestos and also the need to increase the effectiveness of monitoring and prevention, especially in the civil construction industry, for certain tasks, such as the repair and removal of materials containing various types of asbestos.
I congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and its rapporteur, Mr Meyer, on the proposals he has presented us with and which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs made the effort to include, despite the limited prospect of their becoming law.
We also feel that this is, in fact, a public health issue, which should be looked at on the basis of Article 174, in another context.
I should like to draw your attention to the efforts made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and to emphasise that my colleagues have helped to ensure that this report is today a more ambitious, more wide-ranging report, which also makes greater demands for the follow-up process.
We hope that the Commission and the Council will take account of these efforts.
Amongst the proposals are new limits, a new organisation to oversee risk prevention and a greater effort by all parties involved, specifically by employers, who are asked to provide more training, and who are asked not to shirk their responsibilities by hiring workers without proper contracts, or who are subcontracted.
There must be guarantees that workplaces subject to risks of asbestos are properly protected and that every precaution is taken to prevent the diseases that can result, which are serious diseases and as a rule carcinogenic, with a high mortality rate, which must be eradicated.
In order to eradicate these diseases, the Member States, the public authorities, must also be required to accept other responsibilities; specifically, when local authorities, civil protection services, and site inspectors are consulted, before demolition or maintenance work, hiring workers or opening a work-site begins, they must verify whether or not the legislation of the Member States and Community guidelines in this field is being complied with.
This is the rigorous evaluation we needed in order to make a legislative proposal that can, once and for all, put an end to certain arguments, which have more to do with vested interests than with what should be guiding us, which must respect the primacy of people's integrity at work and in society.
This being the case, we would like the Commission to provide this Parliament with epidemiological studies that clearly show the consequences of each asbestos fibre for the health of workers, which groups are at risk, to supply statistics that will enable a reliable study to be conducted and also to prevent some countries in the Union, six to be specific, from maintaining higher limits than those now being proposed.
Enlargement will, furthermore, lead to discrepancies between the preventive practices of the various countries in the Union.
Compensation for accidents and diseases is another issue that we would like the Commission to look into.
Compensation paid to victims, specifically to fatal victims, is lower than that paid out for road accidents, which we do not find acceptable.
We also think that the Commission, regardless of the fact that the Member States clearly bear full responsibility in this area, must steer this debate in such a way that companies that cause their workers, by means of concealing the truth, to contract these diseases are punished and that the compensation paid out is, in light of all the criteria, acceptable and socially fair.
The Commission must also take advantage of this range of packages - which it presented to Parliament in good time - to review the legal and conceptual criteria of hygiene and safety.
There are striking differences between the organisation that is proposed for this directive and the directive on building sites and others and, we hope, therefore, that the Commission supports this revision in order to establish best legislative practice in this field.
Mr President, in the 60s and 70s, asbestos was considered a universal remedy in construction, in industry and as a subsurface for roads.
Meanwhile, many victims who have inhaled asbestos dust have died from it.
Long after it was known how destructive asbestos is in people, this relatively cheap material was still used in different countries.
Even now that its use will end in 2005 at the latest, we will still be contending with its harmful legacy for a long time.
In the next 30 years, half a million people will become disabled and die prematurely in western Europe alone, because the illness often does not become apparent until long after infection.
The demand for damages, other forms of compensation, disability pension and widows' and orphans' pensions is only right and proper.
Asbestos is used in buildings, appliances and vehicles in numerous locations, and it must be disposed of expertly.
In the Eastern states that wish to join the European Union, the problem is even greater, partly because, in the countryside, houses there are built using roofs and facades that are entirely made of asbestos sheets of Russian origin.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has, in 15 additional amendments, mainly attempted to draw attention to people who have never worked with asbestos themselves, but who can become infected, such as family members, residents of dwellings that contain asbestos or people in the vicinity of asbestos-removal activities.
We must assume that every building from the asbestos era contains asbestos unless, on the basis of independent evidence, it is proven otherwise beyond any doubt.
The proposals which I support are also aimed at making registers for all Member States and candidate countries compulsory, together with inspections of authorised scrapyards and a restriction on the transport of disposed asbestos to a distance of 500 km.
In addition, the European Commission is invited to make proposals before the end of 2003 for the compensation and protection of victims who are not exposed to asbestos through their work, also in those cases in which the source of contamination is unknown or the company responsible no longer exists.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs DamiÃ£o very much for her work on such a sensitive aspect of health in the workplace.
Discussion on improvements in the labour market and on a better quality of work within the culture in which stable work was an underlying principle of labour law usually focuses more on what is now termed health in the workplace and used to be referred to as health and safety in the workplace. There is a tendency to overlook a fundamental issue.
Work always entails a risk.
No situation is free from risk. Worse, that risk is sometimes hidden, not immediately obvious, does not strike us at once, and is difficult to detect.
This, I believe, is the situation in which those who work with asbestos find themselves.
Working with asbestos can be dangerous.
It can result in very serious illnesses such as lung fibrosis, pleural fibrosis or mesothelioma. A number of doubts and unanswered questions still surround the use of this substance.
These concern for example the effect of inhaling small doses on the risk of cancer, the limits below which one can be certain that cancer will not arise and the carcinogenic properties of various types of amphibolic asbestos or chrysothile asbestos. Then there are the many jobs in which asbestos is or has been used, jobs undertaken by small and medium-sized enterprises with inadequate personal safety equipment.
Further, the equipment is often incomplete or is incorrectly used. I refer to jobs such as maintenance, repair, overhaul or refurbishment of buildings, and also to the repair or scrapping of vessels, motor vehicles or industrial equipment.
Another equally significant uncertainty relates to the length of time it takes for the disease to manifest itself. This has a bearing on establishing responsibility for it, and on the need for preliminary or regular medical examinations for workers at risk from asbestos.
As was stated previously, preventive measures are also needed for those who happen to live in the vicinity and may be indirectly affected. I have to say in this regard that we do not agree at all with the rapporteur that the directive should cover more than the protection of workers.
I should like to be very clear.
I mean all types of workers at risk of contracting asbestos-related diseases. This is because in our view a different legal basis is called for.
We do not believe either that the onus of proof should be reversed automatically in cases where the cause of the pathology is in doubt.
On the other hand, we do totally agree with the rapporteur on the need to change the culture on risk prevention in the workplace in general and on prevention of risks related to asbestos in particular.
We agree on the need to raise awareness at all levels that is, at state level and amongst employers and workers. We also agree that more training and information would be useful and indeed necessary.
In short, we do feel it is time for a change of culture.
I appeal to the Commissioner on this.
The change should be set in train and promoted by the Commission and the Council.
We agree too on the importance of social dialogue as a way of achieving an effective policy on health in the workplace. We would also encourage administrations to collaborate amongst themselves.
We would possibly ascribe less importance to a third interlocutor, namely the state. This is because the state clearly has a great many other concerns, and a large number of new regulations are not what is needed in this case, unless new risks become apparent.
Action at a non-regulatory level will prove much more important. In conclusion Commissioner, I feel the Commission could make a significant contribution in this area.
Mr President, we all know that asbestos is one of the biggest threats of all to the health of workers in the EU.
It is estimated, as a previous speaker has also said, that getting on for half a million deaths over the next 35 years will be directly linked to the serious illnesses caused by asbestos.
The history of asbestos and the debate we have had about it show, in my view, how incredibly important it is that we take the precautionary principle seriously.
For many years, asbestos was used without a thought for the harmful effects it might have and, as a precise consequence of this, the asbestos problem will dog us for many years to come.
The proposal tabled by the Commission will ensure better protection of workers who are in danger of being exposed to asbestos in the course of their work, and it is on the whole a really sound proposal.
The proposal reduces the limit value for the number of asbestos particles to which workers may be exposed. In view, however, of the danger presented by asbestos, it is good that the rapporteur try to have the limit value reduced further.
What is crucial is that the employer be obliged to provide a relevant training programme for everyone at risk of being exposed to asbestos in the course of their work.
Workers must be clear about how to protect themselves and others.
In accordance with the Commission's proposal, common guidelines concerning the content of the training programme must be set up, and these must be as precise and exhaustive as possible.
I should like today to call upon the Member States to go still further and set up proper, formal training schemes for working with asbestos.
I would also comment on the ban on asbestos.
The 1999 directive bans chrysotile, which is the last type of asbestos it is permitted to use.
The total ban on all use and marketing of asbestos is to be implemented in all the Member States from January 2005.
I learn, however, that it is apparently uncertain whether the ban also applies to the export of asbestos to countries outside the EU.
If the ban is indeed uncertain, the problem should be tackled.
It would be ethically quite wrong if the EU were to export asbestos for use in third countries.
It would be contrary to all the principles on the basis of which we normally proceed.
I do not know how we are to approach the matter legally. I will adopt a political approach to the matter, and I should like to take the opportunity to ask the Commissioner to give an account today of the Commission's interpretation of this problem.
Is it uncertain whether the 1999 directive does in fact ban exports to countries outside the EU?
It would be interesting to be given an answer to that question.
I also wish finally to say a big thank-you to the rapporteur, who has done an incredible amount of work to get this report up and running. I am entirely in favour of the report.
Mr President, every year 100 people die in my West Midlands constituency of asbestos-related diseases.
Every year 4,500 people die in the UK from these diseases according to the trade unions, and studies predict, as Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said, that in excess of between 250,000 and 500,000 will die cross Western Europe in the next 35 years.
The evidence is there.
The facts are clear, based on scientific studies.
Exposure to asbestos can maim and kill and asbestos workers have to be protected.
Manufacturing of asbestos has been banned in almost all Member States, but there are still millions of tonnes of asbestos left in Europe's buildings, industrial plants, railway carriages that were built in the 1950s and the 1960s, etc. I agree with the report that the presence of asbestos has to be presumed in a building if it has not been proved otherwise.
Workers will continue to be exposed for many years because of demolition, removal, refurbishment and maintenance still having to take place.
That is why I sought further tightening of exposure levels in committee by proposing an amendment, which was accepted by committee, which would effectively halve the exposure allowed.
Instead of the eight-hour exposure limit, it was opting for a four-hour exposure limit.
It would also reflect the current working patterns within an industry because shifts are a lot less than they are in other sections of the industry.
An eight-hour reference period will allow higher levels of exposure over a shorter period like one to two hours, which to my mind is unacceptable.
I would like to see this limit for all workers who are exposed to asbestos, with the exception of people working in asbestos cement.
I genuinely believe that is a separate case.
It is important we do not have different exposure limits, however, depending on the type of work, as Amendment No 21 has, but this will be dealt with in conciliation.
I urge you to vote for Amendment No 21 and for the last six words of Amendment No 42.
My understanding is that if Amendment No 21 is accepted then we can vote for the last sentence of Amendment No 42 which deals with asbestos cement, but we need clarification on that from the President.
I urge you to vote for this excellent report.
It is one example of an EU directive where there is compelling scientific and medical evidence that it is needed to save lives across the European Union.
Commissioner, Mr President, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteurs, both Mrs DamiÃ£o and Mr Meijer, for yet another important building block that has been added to the edifice of - in this case - legislation concerning conditions at work at European level.
In my view, this will be a constant process, and so it should be. I will return to this point in a moment.
Prevention is what is desperately needed in activities of this kind, and we are all too aware of this.
In the past, I too handled asbestos when making and connecting pipes and tubing.
In retrospect, I probably consumed incredible amounts of fibres, and I am unsure of the end result, but I must stress at this point that it was in the context of DIY.
And this is exactly where the problem lies for, at the moment, we can ascertain quite clearly that, although we are drafting decisions on behalf of workers, we are doing too little for all kinds of related factors: subcontracting has been mentioned, DIY is a factor, and there is the problem of people living in the vicinity of asbestos.
I would therefore call on the Commission, possibly via the Environment Commissioner, to lay down additional legislation which we could use.
I will overlook for a moment all the other elements which demonstrate the importance of this legislation, including these half million people, for everyone has mentioned them.
I would like to return to what Mrs Lynne mentioned a moment ago, namely the aspects relating to asbestos cement and air-placed asbestos.
These have, in fact, been mentioned by Mrs Smet in the past.
I have noted that what is important here is the handling of asbestos, air-placed asbestos or asbestos cement, the processes they undergo and the amount of fibres released per cubic centimetre.
This must be measured, and certain substances should not be excluded for no apparent reason.
Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs DamiÃ£o on the report.
