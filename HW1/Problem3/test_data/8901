I feel that the European Union should also use the coming International Year of Mountains as an opportunity to express the specific concerns of mountain regions and recognise mountain regions as indispensable habitats.
At the same time, the quality of life in mountain regions must be maintained and protected and the constant threat of exodus must be stopped.
This report is also, by definition, the European Parliament's position on the International Year of Mountains and should be seen by the Commission and the Council as our basic wish list.
Basically I call in this report, which was adopted almost unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for a comprehensive EU strategy for mountain regions.
The report contains numerous new and, to my mind, practical proposals which I call on you to support during the coming vote.
The Commission is thus called on, first, to submit a communication this year setting out EU actions in connection with the International Year of Mountains.
I think this communication should contain a comprehensive concept for the regions in question with regard to the period after 2006 and with regard to enlargement.
This will, of necessity, include revising Directive 268/75 and subsequent amendments.
At the same time, I should like to clarify that the overall concept needed must take account of the principle of subsidiarity.
Despite what are often similar problems and difficulties, it is a fact that even mountain regions differ in their individual characteristics, meaning that there is no universal patent solution.
Common problems can be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach.
My report therefore advocates an approach which takes equal account of the following areas: farming and forestry, transport, tourism, energy and water, regional planning, nature conservation and the maintenance of the common cultural heritage.
Now a few words on individual demands set out in the report.
Agriculture: basically it calls for the second pillar of agricultural policy, the development of rural areas, to be extended, taking appropriate account of the contribution made by farming to the environment and the countryside and the multifunctional character of agriculture.
We need to find common problem-solving strategies in the form of regional conventions, set and update criteria and data on mountain areas and fund practical, mountain-related projects under the sixth framework programme, extend the basic infrastructure needed and provide training and further training so that the population keeps abreast of events and strengthen transport networks in mountain regions, taking account of the principle of sustainability, in order to safeguard these regions as habitats and economic areas and nature areas.
This means, for example, that access roads to farms and alpine pastures must be guaranteed, while bigger roads must comply with criteria of strict eco-compatibility.
Finally, last but not least, mountain regions need special treatment in the run up to enlargement.
The forthcoming International Year of Mountains is an ideal time, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the specifics of tomorrow's proposal.
You, ladies and gentlemen, by voting in favour of my report, and more importantly you, Commissioner, and the Commission, by implementing the ideas contained in it can make a fundamental contribution to this development.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I should like to start by thanking Mr Ebner for his own initiative report.
This is a report which I can wholeheartedly support.
Given that, as Mr Ebner has just said, mountain regions account for around 30% of the land area in the EU, while in many Member States, such as Austria, they account for as much as 50%, I welcome and support this own initiative report.
The importance of mountain ecosystems is a cultural heritage.
The maintenance and sustainable management of resources is very important in numerous regions of Europe.
The protection of mountain regions, forests, water, the ecological balance and biodiversity needs to be set out in an overall European concept.
Many mountains straddle frontiers.
Many problems can only be solved more efficiently by means of a cross-border approach and by joining forces.
I must stress that farming and forestry have a multifunctional role in mountain regions and that this will be hugely important in an enlarged Union.
Both the people who live in the mountains and the tourists who visit every year looking for rest and relaxation value this unique natural and cultural landscape, which is why we must create appropriate incentives for people to live and work there.
We must take precautions to prevent the ecological and socio-economic consequences of exodus and depopulation.
Sustainable cultivation by mountain farmers not only provides quality food, it also renders a huge service to mankind as a whole.
The United Nations have rightly proclaimed 2002 as the International Year of Mountains.
I think it is important for Europe to take a stance now and for the Commission to present a communication as quickly as possible, setting out a really clear definition, taking account of criteria such as altitude, gradient and the vegetation which has been cut down so that we can really address the various problems throughout Europe, and proposing appropriate concepts for strategies and development mechanisms.
Mr President, the Ebner report is going to offer the Commission a very good model to follow when producing its communication for the International Year of Mountains 2002.
However, amongst its many and, I believe, very valuable, proposals, I would like to draw your attention to certain issues which, on this forthcoming celebration of the silver wedding of mountain farming, should receive very special, and in some cases new, attention.
I am referring, firstly, to the role which should be recognised for women in this new multifunctional mountain farming.
For them, a new approach is required today which is very different from their obsolete marginalisation within the traditional CAP.
This proposal appears in section 19 of the Ebner report, but if we want to do it well, Mr Fischler, coordinated approach is required.
Within the new agriculture of the mountain regions, women currently play many important roles, both in relation to agriculture and in relation to tourism, rural development, rural tourism, new technologies and in relation to craft-industry, commercial and economic policies.
I hope you understand, Commissioner, that their potential could be enormous.
Secondly, I would like to draw your attention to the proposal contained in section 22, which also relates to another of today' s pressing problems, that of migration policies.
It is proposed that mountain regions where population is decreasing could serve as reception areas for absorbing immigrants, given suitable socio-economic planning.
Thirdly, Commissioner, I believe that compensation measures should be taken to prevent mountain regions receiving less structural aid than they receive at the moment as a result of enlargement.
This must be prevented, because enlargement must not under any circumstances have a negative impact on these areas.
Lastly, I think that small and medium-sized farms should be promoted by means of a modulation of aid that stimulates employment.
Commissioner, I hope that if you really want to provide new impetus and a new strategy for mountain farming, you will take these proposals into account.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank Mr Ebner very much for the work he has done and also for accepting my amendments to the text.
The report speaks for itself: it is complete and exhaustive and also has the merit of setting mountain farming in a wider and more general context of mountain problems.
I think this approach is the right one for achieving a genuine European policy in 2002: International Year of Mountains.
You see, Commissioner, Agenda 2000 does mention mountain farming, but everything gets more complicated at the implementation stage, for instance when Italian regions give notification of intervention laws for mountain areas, for example on animal husbandry or indeed on natural disasters which have already occurred.
Well, your 'Agriculture' Directorate is turning into a worthy and legitimate control body.
It is beginning a long correspondence made up of requests for minute details. It will take at least six months or even more for definite replies to come in, frequently stamped on the closing date, sometimes using the competition rules which always seem to deny the particular characteristics of mountain agriculture.
Sooner or later, especially in the Alpine areas of the Union - lucky Switzerland takes care of its mountains without this network of controls - this could lead to an anti-European backlash.
That is why we ask you, Commissioner, to publicise the principles of this report on agriculture and remember, not just occasionally, that the Union has signed the Agriculture Protocol of the Alpine Convention.
Mr President, Mr Ebner, well done! A good report.
Like under a burning glass, mountain farming shows what happens when you try and master sustainable land management tailored to a particular location.
Your report also has a drawback, however. It only focuses on this aspect.
It is interesting that the House, or rather those still in it - although they do, after all, represent the majorities - can reach a majority understanding on these numerous excellent proposals and warnings.
It is true of agriculture as a whole that we should have fostered sustainable management in general, but then there would have been no agreement here, so that this acts as an alibi and that is a pity.
However, that should not detract from the usefulness of this report and we shall, of course, vote in favour of it.
We should like, however, to widen this debate to agriculture as a whole in order to achieve sustainable land management tailored to each particular location.
Mr President, apart from what is now the standard generalised wish list in the report, the fact that the new regulation will operate within the framework of Agenda 2000 leaves no room for any hope that the present frightful situation will improve or that the survival of farmers, most of whom run small or medium-sized holdings, will be assured. As we know, the trend is towards greater liberalisation of agricultural production and the concentration of land and production in the hands of fewer and fewer people, with the result that mountain regions are sinking faster and faster into economic and social stagnation.
All that the proposal to offset the reduction in Community support for these regions by applying national and regional measures means in practice is that the European Union will completely abandon mountain regions and will attempt to shift even the miserable and ineffective support of the last 25 years on to its Member States.
This shift will have a massively adverse impact on countries such as Greece, which have a high proportion of mountain regions and a small budget, with the result that it will be impossible to support these regions from national funds.
In addition, this sort of proposal recommends nationalising the financing for policies formulated by the European Union, meaning that the poorest countries will be forced to apply anti-farming Community policy without any compensation or support measures and pay for it out of their own pockets.
Furthermore, the proposal to reject the removal of the milk quota system in mountain regions on the grounds of reduced competitiveness and high production costs is proof of the total lack of any social criteria and the annoying hypocrisy of the European Union's environmentally-friendly pronouncements, given that the same restrictive measures are being applied to mountain and industrial livestock farming, while we all know the differences between them as regards both the environment and public health.
What with grim neo-liberal criteria and the profit and competition argument, mountain regions are condemned to stagnation and abandonment.
It is for these reasons that we shall be voting against the report, because we believe that the specific measures proposed, operating within the more general framework of Agenda 2000 and the so-called competitiveness argument will not only reverse, they will speed up the economic stagnation and desertification of mountain regions, with huge economic, social and environmental consequences.
Commissioner, without waiting for 2002 and its International Year of Mountains, we twenty Members who are still here all agree that we should protect hill and mountain farming, which is said to represent 20% of our land.
I myself come from a region where there are mountains and where transhumance is practised, in our case with flocks of sheep.
It really is an ideal form of farming, especially for the European Commission.
You have the countryside, forests, biodiversity and the environment, you are preventing soil erosion and producing high-quality products, honey, meat and fruit, you have the tourist industry, and you put the accent on quality of life.
Above all, you are not practising productivism, you are not farming intensively, you are not annoying the United States in the world markets in wheat, oilseeds and animal proteins.
Basically, hill and mountain farming is multi-functionalism without the quantities.
It is the Austrian model that the 2006 reform of the CAP intends to generalise throughout Europe, including the lowland areas.
It conjures up a picture of rosy-cheeked milkmaids, accompanied, of course, by Commissioner Fischler, frolicking among haystacks, cow-bells, marmots and alpine pastures, and stroking rare-breed cows, while Mr Bush' s Texans have a monopoly in the meat market.
So let us say yes to hill and mountain farming, in the hills and mountains, but no to a European farming industry reduced by WTO negotiations to a series of theme parks with peasants dressed up by Mike Moore to look like Walt Disney characters, whose job would be to entertain Anglo-Saxon tourists and conserve the landscape.
Mr President, I want to thank Mr Ebner for a very comprehensive and stimulating report.
We could return to the subject at a later stage in another way and produce some costings and a tighter, more comprehensive proposal as to how we will put the ideals expressed in this report into effect.
We have to consider too that we will have a conflict.
Firstly there is the size of the budget we have and enlargement, which will also lead to an increase in the mountainous area within the European Union, while at the same time we refuse to produce any resources to finance the very idealistic proposals in this report which most people in this House would subscribe to.
In parts of the European Union at this moment people drive two hours to work in their cars, two hours home and live in overcrowded circumstances.
All the utilities are over-utilised while in other areas we are closing down public services.
Roads are under-utilised, we are withdrawing police stations and closing down little churches and schools.
We in the European Union should not make the mistake the Americans made.
We should not abandon vast areas of our countries, where human activity will fade away.
These mountains will not be attractive if there are no villages, if there are no variable scenes of farms and livestock and people living there.
They will not provide the tourist amenities we need in the future.
If we allow this to happen, it will be like what we did in my country 50 years ago when we closed down our railways.
We will regret it in 40 or 50 years from now.
If we lose these areas as habitats for human beings and everything that goes with that then Europe will be so much the poorer and we will regret it.
We should fight within the European Union because individual States have failed.
I was in Scotland during the summer and I have seen the extent to which the Highlands have been denuded of their population.
Britain is much the poorer for that.
If we allow this to happen elsewhere we will have a Europe that will be much poorer.
We should return to this subject later and make firm proposals for the budgetary resources that we, as a Union, could use towards this end.
Mr President, the figures some Members have quoted amply demonstrate that the mountains are the minority of minorities in this House.
We represent only a little over 5% of the inhabitants of Europe, of European citizens, but, as documented in the annals of the European Parliament over fifty years of the European Union, this is only the third time that the word 'mountain' and a motion for a resolution about mountains have been heard in this Chamber.
The first time was in 1983. The rapporteur then was Mr Colleselli, from Cadore, in the North of Italy.
The second time, fifteen years later, I myself had the honour and the duty of bringing the problems of the mountains to this House, with my report on a new strategy for mountain regions, approved on 23 October 1998.
My report started from an overall view of the problems of mountain regions, in all their complexity, and concluded that mountain farming was and remains the key.
The Ebner report - and I congratulate the rapporteur on the specific detail he has been able to put into it - takes this aspect further and opens up another horizon.
I can state that he starts precisely from the conclusions of the previous report by indicating that the salvation of the mountains we are all calling for can start from the farming sector itself.
However, we are all aware, once again, that farming cannot do it alone.
That is why there are also proposals in Mr Ebner' s report which involve the whole mountain world: transport, infrastructure, tourism, the eco-system.
There is another factor we must protect and safeguard; the vital factor for the mountains, Commissioner, is and remains man.
The average age of farmers in Europe - as you know -is about 50.
Some mountain farmers are over 60.
That is a dire statistic for the future of the mountains.
We must make mountain farming attractive again, give the farmers confidence, and give them resources.
Above all we must have the courage to recognise, Commissioner, that a specific type of farming called mountain farming exists.
Let us do so with conviction so that the mountains themselves can continue to exist!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission has always seen hill and mountain farming as a very important and highly interesting subject.
I should like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, more importantly, the rapporteur, Mr Ebner, for this own initiative report on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming.
Starting with the 1998 Santini report on a new strategy for hill and mountain farming and with the International Year of Mountains coming up next year, the Ebner report highlights the importance of mountain regions to the European Union.
In particular, it stresses the importance of environmental protection and the need to maintain natural beauty spots, produce quality products and urgently maintain the cultural heritage.
It also points out that the viability of the countryside in mountain regions goes far beyond agriculture and depends on a multitude of factors.
It is clear from this starting premise that the same questions preoccupy us.
Multifunctionality is also the cornerstone of our new rural development policy.
It aims to promote farming in which all functions and services are recognised, every function which farmers offer our society.
This is an integral part of the European farming model and I can assure you, in response to a number of concerns expressed in the report, that the Commission will stand squarely behind the need to take account of this aspect during trade negotiations at the World Trade Association.
With enlargement impending, the report calls on the Commission to create a global strategy for mountain regions and hill and mountain farming both in the Member States and in the candidate countries.
On this point, I must say, the Commission approach differs from the approach taken in the report.
May I remind you that the new rural development policy only started up last year.
We placed subsidiarity right at the forefront of this new policy, so that the Member States could set their own priorities and include what they consider are the most suitable measures for making the best of their regions and dealing with local drawbacks or difficulties in their rural development plans or Structural Fund planning documents.
This decentralised approach, which also applies to the SAPARD programmes, means that the rural development programme can be properly tailored to mountain regions and can accommodate the differences between them. For example, the Pyrenees need different concepts from the Alps.
This fosters sustainable development which takes account both of socio-economic problems and the environmental challenges facing each of these regions.
Instead of laying down central guidelines, as was recently the case, we should be discussing how best to implement the mountain region policy in detail not just with all the Union institutions and bodies, the Member States, the regions and the local authorities but also with our economic and social partners, non-governmental organisations and scientific circles.
I should like to point out, Ã  propos, that the Commission accepted the second report on economic and social cohesion on 31 January this year. This report raises the question of setting priorities for the balanced and sustained development of the regions in an enlarged Union and the question of covering increased cohesion requirements, to mention just two, and calls for discussion on the subject.
This report offers numerous opportunities to develop regions lagging behind.
The main aim of the Commission's contribution to the International Year of Mountains, therefore, is to advertise our current development mechanisms more widely.
The Commission will organise a seminar in the second half of the year at Commissioner Barnier's and my initiative, the purpose of which will be to present and advertise the opportunities which Community policy offers mountain regions.
You and any other interested parties are also invited to attend.
To come back to the report, I should like to emphasise that it is already possible as the law now stands to provide targeted support for hill and mountain farming through compensatory payments, which form and shall continue to form our basic support for mountain regions, and through environmental measures, through aid for forestry, through processing aid and marketing aid or through diversification aid, for example in the tourism sector.
I should also like to remind you, Mrs Rojo, that the instructions for drawing up rural development programmes state that express reference must be made to programmes specifically for women and that each of the rural development programmes must contain a chapter describing specific help for women.
The same rules apply to rural development and the common organisations of the market.
These too take account of the specific nature of extensive farming, especially in mountain regions, either through specific, customised measures such as beef extensification premiums or premiums for sheepmeat or goatmeat production or by giving the Member States additional room to manoeuvre by allowing them to give special support to regions of their choice.
The Commission will address special treatment for farmers in mountain regions in relation to milk quotas, as proposed in the report, as part of its midterm review.
Finally, we should not forget, with reference to the Structural Funds, that 95% of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2.
These mountain regions can all apply under current support rules and the Member States can tailor the measures needed to individual demands, be it in relation to transport or telecommunications networks, basic public services or support for economic activities.
In principle, this can be complemented by national aid, as Mr Caveri mentioned.
Here too, however, the golden rule is that we continue to require notification a) because this gives regions the security of knowing that their measures will be seen to be compatible with EU law and b) because we must not allow unfair competition between individual regions.
I cannot address all the suggestions in the report, but I hope that the seminar organised by the Commission to coincide with the International Year of Mountains will give plenty of opportunity to come back to these suggestions.
In the meantime, the Commission will exercise its powers and right of initiative in order to examine the conclusions of the report in greater detail and continue the dialogue started today.
I am positive that this will allow us to successfully raise the profile of mountain regions and highlight their importance to Europe.
Thank you very much Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m.
Basic education in developing countries
The next item is the report (A5Â­0278/2001) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on basic education in developing countries in the context of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in September 2001 [2001/2030(INI)].
Mr President, as you suggested, this report is meant to focus on the real opportunity that the UN Special Conference on Children and Children's Rights which takes place later this month gives this Parliament to focus on a fundamental way in which we can tackle global poverty.
It is an opportunity for us not only to give a profile to this subject but also to call for action.
Let me set out what the targets are: free and compulsory education for all, halving adult illiteracy by 2015, eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary schools by 2005 and extending learning opportunities for adults and young people and improvements in the quality of education provided.
We are quite tired of hearing about development targets.
They are set and they are endless.
We know the 'whys' for all these development concerns.
What we from the Committee on Development and Cooperation are asking is 'how' we are going to deliver on these targets.
The subject is at the heart of the global strategy that we, in our committee, discuss on poverty.
The EU clearly has a key and central role to play here.
Clear commitments were made at Dakar in Senegal last year.
But neither from the EU nor anyone else really are we getting practical strategies.
I was a teacher myself for 30 years, mostly in primary education so I think I am quite justified in having a passion about looking at the reasons for this crisis.
One in six of the world's population are functionally illiterate.
One hundred and thirty million - one in five - of the total number of children are not in any kind of primary education.
One terrible statistic is that two-thirds of those are little girls.
Their learning situation is terrible.
Many of will have seen children trying to learn sitting under a tree with not even a blackboard to assist the teacher.
When we talk about information technology we are often talking about children who have never even held a pencil in their hand, never mind being likely to sit at the keyboard of a computer.
In these schools too the quality of their education is often affected by the fact that they are not taught in their own language.
There is a clear link between illiteracy and income poverty.
Average incomes in a country mirror very clearly the levels of access to education.
There is a clear link between child mortality rates and the level of parental education.
A 10% increase in girls' enrolment in primary school would bring a substantial improvement in infant and maternal mortality rates.
And yet we see aid from developed countries to basic education being slashed from budgets across the globe.
It is only 1% of the total.
Developing countries themselves take insufficient interest in the importance of education.
The sub-continent of India spends less than 1% of GDP on education.
As far as the EU is concerned, I hope the Commissioner will agree that this is not enough.
I hope you are not going to state in your presentation that all of this will be incorporated into existing procedures.
We need an answer from the Commissioner on how we intend to implement the goals.
I would like to hear how he intends to improve coordination of the national indicative programmes for Cotonou and about our involvement in the steering committee working on education in Africa.
I also know that there is a promise of a communication on basic education from the Commission during the Belgian Presidency.
I would like to know when we might expect to see that.
Let me just touch on one or two issues.
Priority for girls obviously, and I suspect that Mrs Junker will speak about that.
Last in, first out; that is what happens to girls.
Girls have a low status and therefore there is no priority for getting them into school.
I would like to see a lot more training in ministries in developing countries and concrete programmes to ensure that we get girls into school.
The impact of HIV is enormous.
There are millions of AIDS orphans in the developing world and in a country like Zambia there are more teachers infected annually with HIV than they are able to train to put in their schools.
These are clearly very critical issues for us to discuss.
Meeting the targets looks difficult.
Is there sufficient political commitment in current circumstances to ensure that we will get all the girls into school by 2005?
The reality is, and I hope that people will admit this very clearly at the UN Conference the week after next, that as things are going all of these targets are unachievable.
Meeting the target of universal primary education looks extremely difficult.
I would like to know from the Commission how its work in trying to achieve these targets includes NGOs and civil society and all those people who are involved in the Global Education Campaign.
It is a very successful, active and dynamic campaign.
I would hope that the European Commission is very much engaged with them but I suspect that is not the case.
According to the Global Education Campaign, the targets on education would require USD 8 billion a year.
This is the equivalent of four days of global military spending and 9 minutes of international currency speculation.
Therefore it seems to me that if the commitment was there, we could deliver.
It is a price worth paying.
The current inequities that I have described are untenable and certainly indefensible.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is fair that I begin my speech on behalf of the PPE Group by congratulating Mrs Kinnock on her excellent report and on the passion with which she is defending it.
I believe that the proposals in this report, together with the resolution which we approved at the last part-session in July, represent the best contribution this Parliament could have made to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children, because there is no question, unfortunately, that education is still the great unresolved issue within development cooperation, despite the formal declarations and the commitments given at the various international conferences which have addressed this issue.
The figures on the millions of children not attending school, which Mrs Kinnock pointed out, speak for themselves in this respect.
While it is a grave situation that so many children are being deprived of their fundamental right to education, it is even more grave that, as a result of the violation of this right, millions of people are immersed in poverty and under-development. Because the key to prosperity and progress, especially in the context of the information and communication society which we live in today, lies in the level of education the people have access to.
The conviction that, by not dealing vigorously with the issue of education in the developing countries, we will not only fail to eradicate poverty, but that the gap between the rich and poor countries will increase, has certainly led us to place education at the centre of the global strategy for eradicating poverty.
In this respect, we have to recognise that the Dakar Conference on education for all represented a great step forward, but it is a step which will take us nowhere if action is not taken and if, in accordance with the decisions at Dakar, we do not quickly adopt a concrete world initiative directed towards creating strategies and mobilising the resources required to provide effective support for the efforts made on a national level - as one of the Dakar commitments states.
The European Union, as the main donor and insofar as it has made solidarity and the defence of human rights an essential dimension of its international action, has the responsibility to promote these strategies in close coordination with the other donors, including the Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the participation of civil society and, with them, policies aimed at overcoming the obstacles which deny children access to a quality education.
And the European Union has the moral and political obligation to provide the financial resources necessary to achieve free education for all between now and 2015.
All of this can be done in accordance with the excellent proposals contained in the Kinnock report, which reflect both the practically unanimous feelings of the Committee on Development and the feelings of my group.
However, achieving this objective will also require us to urgently either cancel or restructure the debts of the developing countries in exchange for the funds made available as a result being directed to education programmes.
It will require making the developing countries themselves responsible and encouraging them, through persuasive measures if necessary, to fulfil the commitments given in Dakar and to give absolute priority to education.
Above all, it will require an increase in financial contributions and the allocation of at least 8% of official aid to development and to basic education, in line with the views of the people promoting the campaign for education for all.
Only through resources which match the challenge we have to face will it be possible to win the battle against illiteracy in the world.
I will end by saying that only in this way will it be possible for millions of children to exercise their fundamental right to education, an education which will allow them to open the doors to progress and one day become free men and women.
Mr President, the report by Mrs Kinnock is one of those which the Socialist Group has followed with the greatest interest and affection.
The text gives figures which are often so scandalous that they should provide little comfort for our consciences, because, at the end of the day, they demonstrate the incoherence of almost all of us who believe that the education of children is important for the success of any development process.
There are plenty of declarations recognising that child education in the under-developed world is one of the main conditions if those countries are to be able to begin to free themselves from the situation of justice and backwardness they are in.
Mrs Kinnock' s report mentions the numerous commitments made in this regard by the international community on different occasions. The latest was the world conference on education, which took place in Dakar last year.
The report, however, is also a compendium and a condemnation of incoherences and irresponsibilities.
Incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the developed countries which, despite their promises, have not only failed to increase their programmes in favour of education and care for children in the developing world, but in fact have reduced their efforts in that area.
And incoherence and irresponsibility on the part of the countries of the South which, apart from very few exceptions, are still neglecting the education of their youngest citizens in the face of other priorities such as military expenditure which, in the majority of cases, is still above what is invested in education.
The resolution which we are voting on should not remain, like so many others, as a worthless piece of paper.
This call for coherence and responsibility is a genuine demonstration that our Parliament should promote this issue as a European Union objective.
Furthermore, however, this report should serve as a reference for the action of the Union and many European States, members or candidates for accession, at the United Nations General Assembly which will take place in New York in a few days time.
Glenys Kinnock will be there and will speak out clearly, in the knowledge that we all support her and with the strength which the support deriving from our approving her proposals will give her.
Documents such as this are the best way to respond with specific proposals to a form of globalisation which, since it is mainly focused on the market, is creating inequalities, poverty and exclusion on a world scale and is therefore becoming repellent to many people throughout the world.
I will end by offering our thanks and congratulations to Mrs Kinnock on her work. It will be important to implement what is expressed here, but we must start by broadly distributing the report.
This will convince and guide many people and will increase the credibility of the European Parliament amongst the citizens of Europe.
It will also contribute to some people outside our territory recovering their confidence in us as well as their own sense of hope.
What does the practice of education in the developing countries teach us?
Above all, that good primary education is still far from being granted the priority status that it deserves.
Good, free education is essential for development.
Nine hundred million people are still illiterate.
The Dakar objectives are in danger of not being achieved by a long chalk.
For this reason, new impetus is necessary at the highest political level, particularly from Europe, America and Japan.
There is an urgent need for a strategically developed initiative with a realistic timescale and more financial resources.
Indicative programmes must be drawn up for each country.
Up to now, the European Union has paid far too little attention to education.
The argument that other donors are already doing sufficient is simply and demonstrably untrue.
The cause for the shortfall in educational facilities lies not only with the donors.
Many developing countries themselves give it far too low a priority.
It is outrageous that in Africa twice as much money should be spent on military equipment as on education.
If India continues to spend less than 1% of its GDP on school facilities, of course, development will never come off the ground.
The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent.
Certainly, special attention will have to be paid to girls, early school-leavers, and also former child soldiers.
The basic rights of children will only be respected if adults draw the right political lessons from failing educational practice.
Mr President, we have, of course, far too little time to discuss Mrs Kinnock' s excellent report properly.
I share her scepticism about the great conferences where people in expensive suits and large expense accounts meet to talk about priorities that they afterwards immediately forget, while the education budgets of the poorest countries are falling and the number of children condemned to illiteracy continues to rise.
I really have the impression that a number of countries are acting like some governments in the nineteenth century: keep them poor and keep them stupid, then they will be less trouble.
That is, in fact, the strategic reason I can identify behind the manifest neglect of primary education.
That primary education has also had far too low a priority in our own budgets for development cooperation.
Fortunately, fellow MEPs have already said much that is true.
I will therefore restrict myself to a few suggestions relating to that primary education in Mrs Kinnock' s report, which are particularly pertinent.
That education must be free. Children must not be excluded because they cannot afford primary education; otherwise they are condemned to the street, condemned to exploitation through child labour, and so on.
On the contrary, we should actually give scholarships to children from poor families, so that they can go to school, to cover the miles, to pay for their uniforms, etc. The teachers must also be paid, they must be trained and they must receive a wage that enables them to survive in a decent way, so that they do not have to leave the children to their own devices because they must urgently earn something extra to at least give their own families some food.
It is clear that national action plans will need to be put in place.
I expect much more from governments that are aware of the problem, but in that case we must also be prepared to support those governments and increase their administrative efficiency.
We are far too inclined to sit on the sidelines with our expensive specialists and our expensive NGOs, while we, in fact, give far too little support to the meagre educational facilities in those countries themselves.
That does not detract from the fact that I expect the EU to translate all those words into action.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Kinnock's report is a huge achievement and is to be welcomed unreservedly.
The ACP countries of sub-Saharan Africa are some of the least developed countries.
There are depressing educational deficits here and women and children are deprived of even the most rudimentary basic education.
There are examples, however, which give cause for hope and it is these which I should like to address.
The government of Mali which, as you know, is a bitterly poor country in the Sahel, has imposed an ambitious political programme which courageously tackles decentralisation and comprehensive education reforms.
Children in Mali, boys and girls, are to receive a good school education, where possible in their regional or ethnic dialect.
That is easier said than done, however, because no teachers have been trained in the regional dialects and there are no corresponding curricula, let alone books.
Teachers need to be trained first and books need to be written first; and that is not something which can be done overnight and it is not something which can cover the whole country straight away.
You only have to think of the nomadic groups in the desert.
They require special schools and special arrangements, to name but one example.
This is an enormous challenge in education policy and is being extremely well supported by numerous donor organisations.
The radio can help, especially in sparsely populated regions.
The numerous local and regional stations which have started up in Mali, as in other developing countries, could easily be used for decentralised education plans, even if the tapes used are produced centrally.
Lessons over the radio have always been a way of life in the Australian outback.
In Africa, customised electronic methods and mobile schools could go a long way towards rectifying the education deficit.
It would be rewarding for the development cooperation of the European Union if we were to be involved in these new methods.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the resolution tabled in the run up to the UN Special Conference on Children and congratulates you, Mrs Kinnock, on your most comprehensive report.
Your report rightly highlights the need for urgent measures to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar.
The Commission has also decided to put development policy, especially the education and health sectors, at the top of its agenda in 2002.
Child welfare is a fundamental concern and a basic objective.
An objective that we want to pursue mainly though social policies in sectors such as education and health.
Related questions were addressed last year in the Council and Commission declaration on the European Community's development policy in connection with the fight against poverty.
They also play a pivotal role in the Cotonou partnership agreement.
The Commission has also stepped up support in the education sector and focused measures on basic education, especially primary school education, in recent years.
As a result, the Community has considerably increased the general funds allocated to this sector in comparison with others.
In addition, most programmes to promote primary school education contain special clauses for the benefit of girls, in order to counter gender-based drawbacks.
As far as the specific considerations and recommendations which relate to the Community are concerned, I have the following to say: first, the education sector is instrumental in the strategy to fight poverty, which is the overriding aim of the Community's development policy.
The Commission shares the view that clear objectives need to be defined, that education aspects need to be included in the fight against poverty and that civil society needs to be involved.
The Commission also takes this standpoint in negotiations with developing countries on strategies to fight poverty.
The Commission is determined to play an active role in these negotiations and to further international development objectives.
Secondly, the Community made a formal undertaking in Dakar last year by backing the vision of the world declaration on education for all based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that education is a human right.
This means that the Community has also subscribed to the call for countries seriously committed to education not to be impeded in implementing this objective by a lack of funds.
The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that better coordination and more complementarity between Community measures and national projects, with the help of the Group of Experts on Education, and more intensive cooperation with UNESCO and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa are of paramount importance in improving the effectiveness of Community aid.
The Commission is therefore stepping up its collaboration with UNESCO, especially by supporting UNESCO in coordinating education for all partners.
The Commission is also involved in the working party set up to implement the framework for action set out in Dakar.
It is also promoting the objectives of education for all in its negotiations on the ACP countries' strategies for the ninth EDF.
As far as the difficult question of setting up a global fund for basic education is concerned, the Commission feels, given the Commission procedure for programming and implementing aid, that this sort of fund is not a practicable solution.
However, the Commission does not in principle reject the idea of a global initiative, as provided for in the Dakar framework for action, even if the implementation methods need to be discussed in detail.
Thirdly, the question of children's rights is closely bound up with the gender problem in general.
Education targets for children, especially girls, will not be met until women have an equal status in the family and in the various societies.
The Commission is very firmly in favour of paying particular attention to the education needs of girls in developing countries.
It is currently preparing an action plan on equal treatment for men and women which should deal with this problem.
It is also taking gender-specific questions into account in all special education programmes.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
VOTE
The next item is the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Report (A5Â­0277/2001) by Mr Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming [2000/2222(INI)]
Mr President, there is a problem with the text at item 11, page 10, in the part about mountain wine-growing.
In the Italian text there is a contradiction in the third line from the end where it says that no distinction should be made between the costs of planting vineyards in lowland areas and on mountains. In fact, the sense of the committee' s work and, obviously, the sense of the amendments which have been tabled is that the costs of planting vineyards in lowland areas and on mountains should be compared with the costs of hill vineyards.
.
(NL) An agriculture that is increasingly relying on the world market will try to produce as cheaply as possible, at the expense of the quality of work, of nature, of the environment and of animal welfare.
The least productive regions will be abandoned first.
Those are areas that have been uninhabited over a long period, because it requires more effort to earn a living.
The people who had nevertheless finally settled there, were the outcasts of society.
Often they were ex-convicts, ethnic minorities and losers in the battle for the best land.
The least productive areas where the losers wound up are not only the mountain areas, but also low-lying wetlands, that is, old bogs, the bottom of which consists of peat, a water retaining vegetable material that, when dry, shrinks and disappears.
Farmers in mountains and wetlands now play an important role in nature conservation, recreation and water management.
In a free, unprotected market, they are doomed to disappear.
Then their working and living area will not return to primeval nature, but will go to the dogs.
Mechanising and destroying the landscape to allow it to be cultivated more easily is not an acceptable alternative.
That is why I should like to back the proposed supporting measures, but to register an objection if these are limited to the mountains alone.
We shall ask the services to compare the versions and to take account of your comments.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5Â­0278/2001) by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on basic education in developing countries in the context of the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children in September 2001 [2001/2030(INI)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Ebner Report (A5Â­0277/2001)
Kinnock Report (A5Â­0278/2001)
.
(FR) We support the author of the report in her demand that free, compulsory and high-quality education should be provided for all children up to the age of 15.
However, even in European countries where there are laws to that effect, the free aspect is largely a formality, since it does not include the equipment that children need for school, which penalises children from poorer families, not to mention the overloaded classes and under-equipped state of schools in working-class districts.
These troubles are even more keenly felt in developing countries, even where education is compulsory.
The report claims that solving the education crisis is one of the most effective strategies for breaking the poverty cycle.
This is turning reality upside-down.
Without breaking the poverty cycle, in other words without stopping the pillaging of poor countries and the impoverishment of their working populations, even the most well-intentioned speeches will remain speeches, and millions of children in poor countries will continue to be deprived of even a minimum education.
Our vote in favour of this report means that we agree with the intentions expressed but only subject to these conditions.
That concludes voting time.
Adjournment of the session
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 6.55 p.m.)
Acts of terrorism in the United States
Ladies and gentlemen, I open this extraordinary meeting with the emotion and the sadness that this horrific event, the scale of which would have seemed inconceivable, inspires in us all.
The purpose of this meeting is first of all to demonstrate our solidarity with the American people, who have just been struck by a barbaric act of terrorism, to show our compassion for the victims, for the final toll will certainly be appalling, and to demonstrate our support for all those who are working tirelessly to save what further lives they can.
Yesterday, I expressed this solidarity to President Bush, on my own behalf and on behalf of the entire European Parliament and gave him my assurance that the people of Europe are standing shoulder to shoulder with the United States in the tragic ordeal the American nation is suffering.
When terrorism strikes in a Member State of the European Union we all feel concerned, and these appalling attacks inspire in me the same feeling of disgust and indignation.
Today, we share the pain of the American people.
It is the United States, that great democracy which did so much to help Europe protect its freedom that has just been attacked, but a blow has also been dealt to the sacrosanct values of life and democracy.
The date of 11 September 2001 will remain forever engraved on the memory of humanity.
This tragedy calls for a calm reaction on our part but also for the closest cooperation between all countries that reject terrorism so that the perpetrators of these abominable crimes and those who have supported them can be identified, pursued, arrested and tried and so that blind terrorism can, at last, be eradicated from the surface of the globe.
It also requires the international community to commit itself to finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts that nourish and sustain fanaticism.
Over and above statements, over and above the common response to terrorism that we hope and pray for, all players on the international stage must now shoulder their responsibilities.
From now on resolute action must be the order of the day and I know that the European Union will have to take decisions of vital importance.
I welcome the presence here today of Prime Minister Verhofstadt, Mr Michel, Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Mr Prodi, President of the Commission.
The European Union will have no credibility if it does not establish a common policy on combating terrorism.
The European Commission and the European Parliament have stated this clearly, particularly during our last part-session.
I hope that the Council will study these proposals without delay.
Since the Tampere European Council, some tentative progress has, admittedly, been made with regard to the European area of freedom, security and justice, but this falls considerably short of what is needed.
We must go further.
Although the European Union has made its presence felt on the international stage, in the Middle East, at Durban and even in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, yesterday' s events are proof, if proof were needed, of the imperative need to establish a Europe of defence and a genuinely common foreign and security policy as quickly as possible.
An extraordinary European Council meeting could provide a timely boost to all these elements for, as we know, history waits for no man.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us now observe a minute' s silence for all the victims.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just over 24 hours ago the United States was hit by an attack of unprecedented scale and ferocity.
At this very moment men, women and children of all ages, of all convictions and of all origins are struggling for their lives, while others are mourning the loss of loved ones and others still are suffering the anguish of waiting for reassuring news about the fate of those who are missing.
Madam President, our thoughts are with our American friends who have been assailed by this despicable and barbaric violence.
We would like to be able to express just how much we share their suffering.
Today, we feel that we are all Americans.
I say that, and let there be no mistake about this, because it is not just the United States and its population that has been targeted, but democracy itself.
Democracy and its values of liberty, tolerance and humanity, which are the exact opposite of blind and suicidal terrorism.
As human beings, as believers in democracy, and as Europeans, we cannot nor will we ever be able to accept this barbarity.
Madam President, the Union that we want to build has its origins precisely in the rejection of the hate, fanaticism and murderous madness that nearly led to the downfall of our continent.
And in the face of these tragedies a comprehensive range of concrete and firm gestures is called for.
The various Member States have taken essential initiatives to come to the aid of the United States of America.
Madam President, on behalf of the Union, and following consultation with the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, and the leaders of all the Member States, I have conveyed our deepest sympathy to President Bush.
As a token of solidarity and sympathy, the Union has decided that on Friday, 14 September a day of mourning and solidarity with the American people will be observed.
The Heads of State and Government of the fifteen EU Member States will be issuing a joint political declaration in the morning.
At 12 noon, a three minutes' silence will be observed, during which all activity will be suspended.
(Loud applause) The candidate countries for accession to the European Union are also invited to join us in this act of solidarity.
With this expression of solidarity, in addition to the political decisions which we will be taking in the coming weeks, the people of the European Union wish to express their deep sympathy with the grief, and particularly the pain, which is affecting the American people today.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission took place this morning.
We observed a minute' s silence and then discussed the various political aspects of this appalling tragedy which fall within the direct remit of the Commission.
This afternoon, I stressed before the European Parliament and the General Affairs Council that Europe must demonstrate full solidarity with the American people and adopt a common European position on all aspects of these tragic events.
The Commission is appalled by these criminal, barbaric deeds and has already sent its condolences to the victims and their families and expressed its sympathy for the American people.
Our cooperation with the United States in the fight against terrorism is more essential than ever and must be pursued.
Over the next few days, the Commission will examine the other proposals made in order to be able to take increasingly effective action to fight terrorism.
We are fortunate in that the economic and social structure of our countries is strong and resilient.
Therefore, even in these sad circumstances, we can remain calm and confident, and we will not allow terrorism to divide us or to divide the world in its goals or in its endeavours to achieve them.
We must reflect at this time on the role of Europe.
This criminal action is an attack on all our common values and on freedom itself.
After this event, nothing will ever be the same.
We therefore need to show great solidarity and friendship towards the American people and their government, and the European institutions and governments will work closely with our US and other friends at this tragic time and in the future.
However, there is also a purely European dimension.
The tragic events we have witnessed highlight once again the need for a united, strong, resolute, unified Europe which protects freedom and safeguards peace in Europe and throughout the world, a Europe that acts united alongside countries which share our goals, that acts united to protect and promote the values of freedom and solidarity, the values which are the basis of the democracy preserved by Parliament.
I invite you, therefore, to reflect upon yesterday' s tragedy.
Our citizens will only be able ensure peace and stability for themselves and for their children if they are united in their actions and if they feel that they can count on Europe.
This is the path we must take to safeguard our people: we must follow it courageously, resolutely and responsibly.
(Loud applause)
- (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, first of all, on behalf of the Council, to express our immense horror, outrage and revulsion at the tragic events which hit the United States yesterday morning.
I wish here, on behalf of the European Union, on behalf not only of its leaders but also of all the citizens of Europe, to reiterate our most sincere sympathy for the victims and their families and for the American people and the government of the United States.
This abominable act, which has caused such pain to the American people, is of course also an attack on the universal values which Europe has always shared with America.
I would like, on behalf of the Council, to solemnly reaffirm here the unfailing solidarity of the peoples of Europe with the American people in defending these values.
We want the United States to be aware that Europe is by its side in combating the evil of terrorism, no matter what form it may take.
We cannot allow anonymous terror to undermine the values of the free and democratic world.
We will stand together in attacking the major threat represented by large-scale terrorism.
The battle against this scourge will be all the more effective to the extent that it is supported by preventive actions and a detailed political dialogue with the countries of those regions of the world where terrorism has its roots.
Yesterday' s terrorist attack on the territory of the United States is an unprecedented act of provocation and of particularly loathsome cruelty.
Acts of such barbarity, terror and cowardice cannot be tolerated.
The scale of this tragedy demands an appropriate response.
In conjunction with its allies, the European Union will examine all possible means of preventing such acts and of responding to them in an appropriate manner.
The European Union will step up its activity in the international bodies responsible for the fight against terrorism with a view to ensuring that the perpetrators, accomplices and sponsors of acts of terrorism are rendered powerless.
However, our determination should, under no circumstances, fail to go hand in hand with responsible prudence.
At this moment we do not know the identity of the perpetrators, sponsors and possible accomplices of these terrible attacks.
These are essential factors in being able to judge and react in a rational manner with a responsible and meaningful attitude.
We must avoid any type of impromptu action.
While awaiting a response to these questions, our governments have taken the necessary steps to protect their people.
The Council has been informed of security measures adopted as a matter of urgency by the Member States.
In order to maximise cooperation between us, the Council has asked the Justice, Home Affairs and Transport Councils to take whatever measures are necessary to maintain the highest level of security as quickly as possible, particularly in the area of air transport, together with all measures required to prevent other attacks.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council on 27 September and the informal Transport Council on 14 September will evaluate those measures already taken and any that may be necessary to complement them.
The Extraordinary Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers has condemned these acts of barbarity, which are an insult to our common values, in the strongest terms.
We have declared 14 September 2001 a day of mourning in the 15 Member States.
We have asked the presidency to maintain close contact with the United States so as to study with them how best to provide whatever help may be required.
At the request of several Member States, the Secretary General of NATO has informed the Council of the discussions in progress within that organisation.
I can now read to you the declaration by the European Union:
"The Council of the European Union, meeting in special session today, in the presence of the Secretary General of the Atlantic Alliance, expressed its horror at yesterday' s terrorist attacks in the United States.
The Council stressed its complete solidarity with the government of the United States and the American people at this terrible time and extended its deepest sympathy to all the victims and their families.
We ask all Europeans to observe three minutes of silence on Friday, 14 September at 12 noon and we also declare 14 September 2001 a day of mourning.
These horrendous acts are an attack not only on the United States but against humanity itself and the values and freedoms we all share.
The life and work of our open and democratic societies will continue undeterred.
The Union utterly condemns the perpetrators and sponsors of these acts of barbarism.
The Union and its Member States will spare no efforts in helping identify, bring to justice and punish those responsible: there will be no safe haven for terrorists and their sponsors.
The Union will work closely with the United States and all partners to combat international terrorism.
All international organisations, particularly the United Nations, must be engaged and all relevant international instruments, including those concerned with the financing of terrorism, must be fully implemented.
The Community and its Member States have offered the United States all possible assistance with search and rescue operations.
Discussions are underway to establish what help would be most useful.
Recalling the strong and enduring ties which exist between the European Union and the United States, the Council has asked the presidency to stay in close contact with the government of the United States in order to convey this message of solidarity."
Following on from that, Madam President, these are the conclusions of the Council, so that you will be in receipt of all the relevant information:
"The Council expressed the profound solidarity of the European Union with the American people and approved a declaration condemning the terrorist attacks in the United States.
The Council was informed of the security measures taken by the Member States.
To ensure maximum cooperation between the latter, the Council asks its Justice and Home Affairs and Transport compositions to take all the necessary measures as soon as possible to maintain the highest level of security, particularly in the field of air transport, and any other measures needed to combat terrorism and prevent terrorist attacks.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 27 and 28 September, or earlier if necessary, together with the informal Transport Council meeting on 14 and 15 September, will evaluate the measures which will already have been taken and those which should supplement them.
The Council reaffirms its determination to combat all forms of terrorism with all the resources at its disposal.
The Council also took note of the declaration by the Commission and the President of the ECOFIN Council.
The Council has requested the presidency, the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission submit, as soon as possible, a report on concrete measures that may be recommended to speed up the implementation and the strengthening of the operational instruments of both the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in the field of Justice and Home Affairs.
These measures will be aimed at increasing the capacity of the European Union to fight effectively, together with the United States and all our partners, international terrorism.
As for the Council, it intends to return to these measures regularly in order to ensure, in particular, that all the actions taken by the European Union are coordinated."
(Loud applause)
- (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my group' s sincere thanks to you, Madam President, for having convened this sitting, which gives us all an opportunity to express our deepest sympathy for and solidarity with those families that have suffered losses, with the President of the United States of America, with our colleagues in the US Congress and with everyone in the United States of America.
Yesterday' s horrendous attack in Washington and New York was not just an attack on the United States, but an attack on the entire civilised world, an attack against every one of us, including those in this Chamber.
It was an attack on our ideals of democracy, human rights and peace.
We are filled with grief and horror in the face of this disaster, a disaster which must never be repeated, and the forces of civilisation throughout the world must now work shoulder to shoulder with the United States to bring those responsible for this attack to account, and we must work closely together to prevent future terrorist attacks.
We must find a way to stop attacks of this kind being planned again, and this will also require a whole new dimension in European and international cooperation.
We must commit ourselves today to launching a fight against terrorism, so that the apocalyptic events in New York and Washington do not mean a global apocalypse tomorrow, and as a Parliament we can be proud of the fact that last week we adopted Mr Watson's anti-terrorism report by such a huge majority.
For a few hours yesterday I had the impression that the United States' ability to act had been compromised. The United States is a world power to which we owe a debt of gratitude for fighting against Nazism in the Second World War and thus guaranteeing a peaceful future for Europe and it is a world power which has firmly resisted totalitarian communism, which ultimately led to the collapse of the wall dividing Berlin, Germany and Europe.
On behalf of my group I would like to say that it is in our interest for America to retain its ability to act and to be strong, and for America to remain a good partner and friend to the European Union, and we should work together towards this goal in future.
(Loud applause)
We do not know who the perpetrators are.
There are certain assumptions, but I would counsel against surmising that these assumptions are true.
Above all, should these assumptions be confirmed, I would counsel us all against applying them to the Arab and Islamic world as a whole.
I have never forgotten an outstanding speech given by Anwar al Sadat, the assassinated President of Egypt, on 10 February 1981.
He said that Islam should never be judged by the misguided and irresponsible actions of people professing to be adherents of this great faith.
Islam is a religion based on tolerance, not fanaticism, a religion based on love, not hate, and it is a coherent religion based on order, not chaos.
We should beware of making generalisations, and we should make it clear that we not only wish to live in partnership with our American friends, but that we also want to live in partnership and, if possible, friendship with those Arab and Islamic countries that are committed to peace.
(Loud applause)
We should commit ourselves today to building an order in Europe and throughout the world in conjunction with all our neighbours - an order in which Europe is strong and united.
That is why, Mr President-in-Office, it gives such an impressive signal that both you and the President of the Commission are here today, a signal that we Europeans are united and strong, and that we wish to coexist in friendship and partnership with all our neighbours, on the basis of human rights, democracy, freedom, social well-being and, above all, peace.
That must be the message we send out today, the day after the dreadful events of 11 September 2001.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our group shares the indignation and horror at the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
We wish to express our solidarity with the families of the American victims of these horrendous attacks.
We would also like to express our profound sadness to the families of the European victims and all those who have lost relatives, whatever their colour or continent of origin, because this diabolical attack was not only directed against the American people, but also against the Europeans and the other people who live together in the cosmopolitan world of New York, and we must remember that the World Trade Centre is just a few steps from the headquarters of the United Nations.
This is an attack on our common values, on democracy, on the very foundations of our civilisation.
As the late lamented Francisco TomÃ¡s y Valiente, President of the Spanish Constitutional Court, who was murdered by terrorists, wrote in an almost posthumous article: "Every time a person is killed, something dies within us" .
Exactly a week ago, this Parliament unanimously approved the resolution against terrorism.
Then it was a European problem for certain States.
Today we can see that the situation has changed qualitatively: terrorism has also been globalised as a result of a lethal combination of fanaticism, cowardice and high technology.
Our film archives are full of horror and disaster movies, with monsters attacking New York and other cities.
What happened yesterday reminds us that we do not need monsters: we humans are monsters when we lose our minds.
And as in Goya' s painting, 'the illusion of reason produces monsters' .
We Europeans must play a very significant role in the fight against globalised terrorism, in the fight for common values, for a more peaceful and just world.
We want to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Americans, with our colleagues in the United States Congress, and also with the rest of our allies, in a joint action to resolve the most ferocious conflicts on the planet with perseverance and decisiveness.
We welcome the fact that the Americans, led by their President, despite this cowardly aggression, have so far acted with cool heads, containing their rage, as yesterday Kofi Annan rightly asked them to do.
We would ask the leaders not to change that attitude, not to respond to terror with terror, that we may act jointly, above all in order to achieve something very important, because now is the time to strengthen our alliance with the United States and with all the people of the world who share our ideal of peace, justice and freedom.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, colleagues, this is an important place in which to celebrate this important moment.
We in this Parliament are the tribune of the peoples of the European Union and we have gathered here today to declare solemnly our outrage, our sympathy, our solidarity and our common bond in humanity and democracy with the people of the United States of America, and with the people of New York City and Washington D.C.
We witnessed yesterday a profoundly shocking event.
It is a new and low threshold in the tide of human affairs.
We witnessed an act of war - without a declaration of war - by persons, movements or states, as yet, not fully determined, but who acted with a grim and focused determination.
We must make sure that our response is common and not isolated, shared and not unilateral, aimed at our common enemy, which is terrorism, but not at wider forces such as Islam or the wider Arab world, should that be the source whence this monster may have sprung.
This modern apocalypse is America' s injury, but the wounds are universally shared among the community of democratic nations.
To the people of the United States of America, to its President, its Congressional and civic leaders, and its communities throughout the country, especially the peoples of New York and Washington, to the grieving families of the missing and the dead and to those who have survived the ordeal, we express our sympathy in this hour of hardship and devastation.
New York is a very special place.
It is a multi-cultural microcosm of the whole world.
It is a special gateway between our old continent and the New World.
It was through Ellis Island that in earlier generations, before the spirit of democracy took the deep root it has right across our continent, that our huddled masses, our oppressed and our starving went to find freedom, democracy and opportunity.
It is no accident that when the French Republic gave the people of the United States a gift to celebrate 100 years of that great republic, that they called that statue 'Liberty': no accident either that her extended arms should carry a torch of freedom.
When someone touches that symbol, they touch us all deeply, because it is part of our common, human, democratic bond and inheritance.
I remember, as a schoolboy, seeing on television at home a visit by John Fitzgerald Kennedy to places I had never been in our divided continent.
I remember his visit to the great symbol of that gross division, Berlin, with its wall.
I remember as a boy I could understand, although I did not know about politics or international affairs, that when that man said, "I am a Berliner" , he said something deep and meaningful in terms of solidarity at that time.
Today, as the Prime Minister has remarked, we are all Americans, we are all New Yorkers, we are all Washingtonians.
We share the sense of shock and horror.
We share the bewildered outrage, we feel the vulnerability, for this is our common inheritance from yesterday's barbarous outrage.
We share common democratic values and interests and we stand together willing to fight against terrorism and promote those interests and values.
It is important that we as Europeans say to the Congressional leadership today: 'You do not stand alone.
You are not isolated.
We can make common cause in this matter, and we must do so.'
But, most of all, we stand today in our common bond of humanity as our American friends bravely search for their survivors and for their dead.
Language often fails us on these occasions.
My own colleagues have asked me to invite you, Madam President, in addition to this solemn moment, to open a book of condolence that we might also convey through that, at some appropriate time to the Congress, our interlocutor in US democracy, that in spite of the space which divides us across the Atlantic, we are resolutely united by the bonds of democracy and freedom and in the fight against terrorism.
Our message to them today, in this fight for democracy and against terrorism, is that our only choice is to stand united; for united we stand but divided we shall fall.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, President of the Commission and the Council, the world today seems much bleaker than it did before Tuesday' s shocking events.
The horrific images of the brutal and cowardly acts of terrorism on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington will stay in our minds forever.
No cause could ever justify such a terrifying act of cold-blooded barbarism.
On behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group, I want to express the deep sorrow we feel for the victims who died in this tragedy and wish to send my heartfelt condolences to the families and all those who have lost their loved ones.
Our thoughts are also with the rescue forces, the firefighters and policemen who risked and lost their lives to save others.
What the world witnessed yesterday - and there are no other words to express it - was a crime against humanity.
As soon as the terrorists are identified, they should be brought to an international court for crimes against humanity and judged accordingly.
This is the time to speed up the establishment of a permanent international criminal court.
In the aftermath of this tragedy, the United States of America should also recognise the need for such an institution.
If, on the other hand, the United States responds with attacks on possible suspect countries, they will not only be killing more innocent people, just like those who died so tragically on Tuesday, but they will also be encouraging further counter-attacks: two wrongs never make a right.
The devastating consequences of a spiral of revenge are nowhere more visible today than in the Middle East.
We should do everything possible to ensure that this attitude is not repeated on a global scale.
I would like to express our deep concern about the situation in the Middle East and call for international efforts to bring the peace negotiations back on track to be intensified.
In this regard, we welcome the clear commitment made along those lines by Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Louis Michel, in today' s press and as representative of the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union.
We need to be tough on terrorism, but we also need to be tough on the causes of terrorism.
We need a political response on a global scale to this unprecedented challenge in order to weed out the real roots of terrorism which stem from political, social and environmental conflicts: this concept underlies the report of Mr Watson, which this Parliament adopted last week.
If there is widespread fanaticism, which breeds and supports this sort of terrorism, we can assume that there is something wrong politically.
The European Union is well placed to engage in forms of conflict prevention and conflict resolution which address the causes and not merely treat the symptoms.
That is why we believe a European Union/United States Summit should be held to deal with all aspects of the new terrorist threats, including the social and political causes.
On Tuesday, our sense of security was shown to be illusory.
It became evident that high-tech measures, such as a missile defence system, would be powerless in the face of this new kind of low-tech terrorism.
What has happened in New York and Washington cannot be allowed to ever happen again.
All defenders of democracy must protect our precious civilisation and uphold the civilised rule of law.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, none of us, in fact, have the words to express the feelings aroused by the terrorist attack of unprecedented barbarity with which the United States has just been hit.
The American people is going to have to live through a deeply traumatic experience which is likely to become still more intense as the scale of the disaster they have just experienced becomes more apparent.
In this unimaginable ordeal, they must be able to count upon our unqualified solidarity.
I would add that, if these faceless monsters targeted the United States yesterday, they will be able, tomorrow, to bring terror and death to any region of the world, including, of course, the European continent.
Madam President, my group therefore fully supports the declarations you have made and the steps you have taken on our behalf.
These dismaying attacks constitute a challenge to the whole of the human community, a challenge we are now going to have to learn to take up.
I say 'learn' because, if we all agree that the guilty parties must be found and punished, we are obliged to acknowledge that, where every other aspect of the matter is concerned, more questions than certainties arise out of the tragedy of 11 September 2001.
In my view, nothing would be more inappropriate, indeed more dangerous, than to react to this radically new phenomenon with well-worn notions whose limitations have just been cruelly demonstrated.
After an outrage of this kind, there may, in other words, be a great temptation to call fervently for violent retaliation which would, however, have immeasurable consequences.
What is more, you are right, Mr Poettering. It would do no service to the cause of peace to allow criminal fanatics to be confused with entire peoples, a number of whose representatives have, sometimes with much dignity and in a deep spirit of responsibility, indeed just expressed both their radical condemnation of the terrorists and their solidarity with the American people.
Finally, and in more general terms, no one must forget ever again that we are all part of the same world.
Even the strongest nation of all is not invulnerable.
The entire international community is sentenced to confronting together the great problems facing the planet - the oceans of frustration, the great divisions that are opening up and the negotiations that have broken down - and to cooperating as closely as possible in the search for long-term solutions.
That is undoubtedly the decisive contribution that Europe can make to the world in order to join in taking up the challenge to civilisation facing us.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, Prime Minister, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the initial thoughts which we have to express at this time are feelings of compassion towards the victims and of solidarity with the American people.
The terrorist attack of which they have been the victims is not only aimed at themselves.
It is directed at the very heart of democracy itself.
Democracies are fragile things, and we are well aware that they have difficulty confronting this type of action.
In the light of history and of experience, however, I remain convinced of the American people' s ability to come through this ordeal and, at this time, I believe it is important for this House to express its solidarity with them.
That being the case, I should like to thank you, Madam President, for having organised this meeting which my group, in common with others, had requested.
I am glad that it is taking place.
I hope that it will be followed by a debate enabling us to examine the problems posed by international terrorism in greater depth.
Having, on two occasions, had responsibility for leading the fight against terrorism in my own country, I should like to say that there is, to start with, one false notion that it is necessary to get away from: that there are good terrorists and bad terrorists. There are not; there are only terrorists, full stop.
(Loud applause)
In so far as it involves a minority trying to use force and violent action to impose its point of view on the greatest number of people, terrorism is never anything other than a manifestation of the fascism and totalitarianism which we have fought in the past and which we must continue to combat resolutely.
However, the fight against terrorism presupposes a state of permanent mobilisation, and it is probably because we have rather lost sight of this idea and this obvious fact that we are now confronted with the tragic situation we see in the United States.
I think that the United States has made the mistake of believing it is probably immune from this type of action.
We in Europe have, unfortunately, already experienced such acts: in Germany, Italy, France, Spain and many other countries.
We know that terrorism is a blind force that can strike anywhere and at any time.
We also know that political will is needed in order to combat terrorism.
This will must be affirmed.
Cooperation is also required.
If each State wishes to reserve for itself the information it has managed to obtain and if there is no real cooperation at all between the services concerned, then we will be heading for further disasters.
If, on the other hand, there is a new awareness on the part of our countries and at the level of international cooperation, if there is the will to pool all the information that may be to hand and if, also, a decision is made to create, in one form or another, a permanent body for cooperation, with the ability to analyse this information and propose the necessary measures, then we shall have the opportunity to oppose terrorism with some success.
I should like, for my part too, to concur with what has been said in this House, firstly by our excellent fellow Member, Mr Poettering, and then by Mrs Hautala and Mr Wurtz.
There would be nothing worse at the present time than to speak in such thoughtless terms as to create a sense of solidarity between terrorists and the Muslim world.
That would be the worst of mistakes and the most stupid thing of all to do.
That is why, of course, none of us can be satisfied with declarations that do not mean very much.
I personally think, however, that I - indeed, our Community as a whole - would consider it to be of great value if Muslim religious leaders at the highest level were themselves to condemn these attacks and in that way demonstrate that terrorists proclaiming a perverted faith cannot possibly be identified with, or thought to share any common ground with, the Muslim religion, which deserves the respect of each one of us.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, I shall speak on behalf of the radical delegation.
I would first of all like to thank the Belgian presidency for their initiative on Friday.
I believe that it is all the more necessary since, while the majority of us feel great emotion and great compassion for our American friends, there are those who are saving their emotion and their compassion for the possible American reprisals.
I therefore warmly thank you.
I believe that we have a reason which has not been mentioned here today, another reason to feel compassion for our American friends, and that is that if it is they who have been attacked today, and not us, it is probably due to the lack of courage of our policy, to its ambiguities and its hypocrisies, which have not been demonstrated by our American friends.
Mr Poettering, you rightly talk about the need to confront the causes of terrorism, and I believe that it is crucial for the European Union to examine its policy over the last fifty years, which has been fundamentally racist in relation to the Arab world and the Islamic world, a policy which has done nothing but sustain the worst regimes in those countries, the worst regimes of Saddam Hussein, of Mr Gaddafi, of Mr Hafez El-Assad in the past and his son today, a policy which has hardly shown solidarity with past and present democrats, such as Mrs Ben Sedrin in Tunisia, Mrs Al-Sadaawi in Egypt, Mr Ibrahimi in Egypt, and so many others who fight for democracy in their countries, and I believe that it is a matter of urgency for our Union to make the establishment of democracy in those countries its political priority, since that is the only way to pursue and destroy the terrorist bases in those countries. Terrorism does not come from the Moon.
It is born and grows up in those countries which encourage it, which often finance it, and which are responsible for the fact that yesterday we saw the greatest tragedy since the end of the second world war, the greatest ever terrorist tragedy.
I would like to assure the Commission and the Council that I believe our Parliament must completely alter its position.
It has literally been taken hostage over recent months by certain crypto-Stalinists who have pushed it into excessively Palestinian unilateral positions which certainly have some connection with the current tragedy of our American friends.
We must finally have the courage to break the taboos.
We have an historic duty in relation to Israel, but we also have a duty in the present.
Israel is the only true democracy in that part of the world.
We must break the taboo.
Israel must be part of the European Union.
That is the only way to guarantee security and democracy in that country.
But it is also the only way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to guarantee secure borders for the Israelis, and therefore for the Palestinians.
Furthermore, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is intolerable that the democracies of the world continue to be made fools of, and Mr Louis Michel, our President-in-Office, has borne the brunt of this in Durban.
I thank Mr Michel for his determination and for the resolute fight he put up in Durban, but it is intolerable that the Syrian regime should do what it did in Durban.
Our democracies must create and organise themselves into a worldwide organisation of democracies, so that the empty shell known as the UN may recover its original purpose, which is to resolve the great problems of the world.
Madam President, dear American friends, our sympathy is with the many families who are now missing their loved ones.
Our tears are shed today for those who have lost a son or a daughter, a mother, a father, or both.
Our prayers are with those who are still alive but remain in peril.
Our thoughts are with President Bush and the people he leads.
Our hope is that in the pain of these terrible atrocities, the reaction of the American people will be tempered with wisdom.
Even as we weep, we know that this is not a time for hatred and revenge.
This a moment of truth, a time for reflection for all of us.
We only have one world and we are all responsible for it and its people.
World peace is something of which we all dream, but we have learned through bitter experience that it was not enough simply to tear down the wall between East and West.
We have learned that it is not only the superpowers who can acquire the methods and means of mass destruction.
Small, faceless groups intent on destruction have it within their power to destroy our whole world.
The answer is not only improved intelligence and sophisticated security.
The way to world peace is to work for it by respecting human rights and the right to national self-determination for all.
We must fight torture, terrorism and every crime against humanity.
We must take sustainable development seriously.
We must help the poor, the oppressed and the powerless before they become desperate, suicidal terrorists.
Just as terror can never be justified, neither can oppression.
Oppression breeds people who are prepared to take all life before them in the passionate intensity of their hatred.
We must bridge the gap between the West and the rest of the world, instead of fighting each other.
In this way we may remove the raison d'etre of terrorism.
It is still too early to foresee all the lessons to be learned from Tuesday' s shocking event but it is not too early to know that Tuesday, 11 September 2001 marked a turning point in history.
Our world will never be the same again.
Our thoughts are with the victims of these horrendous attacks and those who grieve for them.
Let the memory of these terrible events always call to mind our duty to take better care of this world.
(Loud applause)
Madam President, on this tragic day, we wish to express our solidarity and our friendship towards the American people, victims of the most horrendous terrorist crime.
Nor do we forget that many nationals of European countries work in the towers of the World Trade Centre, and that many of them have certainly died.
We have a profound feeling that it is not just the United States, but the whole of the Western world, of which we form an integral part, which has been targeted.
It is not in fact just the United States, but the whole of Western civilisation that has just been the victim of an act of war, of a new war, which is murderous but elusive, because it does not correspond to any traditional criteria.
Some people believed, after the fall of the Soviet Union, that the world was becoming less dangerous, and that was an easy excuse to relax the security effort.
That was a grave error.
In fact, we have entered a new era, in which there is a greater risk from rogue States led by people driven mad and blinded by hate and ideology.
Worse still, more elusive than the rogue States are the stateless terrorist organisations whose murderous folly does not correspond to any logic.
This new war is going to force us to review all our strategic ideas.
Firstly, Europe is going to have to understand that security must take priority over abolishing controls at borders and elsewhere.
I shall not dwell on this point, which you all understand.
Secondly, we must strengthen our fight against terrorism and criminal organisations through European cooperation and worldwide cooperation on the exchange of information and on action, but also by first of all putting our own countries in order.
It is terrifying to imagine what ideas may be implanted in other places by the attacks which have just been inflicted on the world' s most powerful country.
Thirdly, we must re-establish the defence effort where it has been relaxed, as it has in my country over recent years.
The threat is real and takes many forms.
The rapid reaction force set up by the countries of Europe is a good idea, provided that its democratic control, its variable geometry and the freedom of engagement of the members are better respected than they are at the moment, as can already be said.
But, above all, it is insufficient.
While seeking to eradicate terrorism, as you have said, Madam President, we must simultaneously make our territories safer in order to better protect our people.
In order to make our territories safer, all useful means must be implemented.
One of these is the idea that President Bush launched some time ago, which is an anti-missile shield for the United States.
The Europeans, for their part, took a rather negative view of this idea.
Today, we must review this issue.
Would it not also be in the interest of Europe to conduct studies into the possibility of having its own shield, alone or in cooperation with the United States?
That remains to be seen.
It would not protect against attacks such as yesterday' s, of course, but it would protect against other risks which we are obliged to anticipate.
Neither, of course, do we currently have the necessary technological means, but the quest to acquire them would be a challenge worthy of consideration.
That would undoubtedly be a European-scale project, Madam President, which would no doubt be a powerful demonstration to the public of the usefulness of respectful cooperation between national sovereign states, which is intended to protect them.
Ladies and gentlemen, today we have wished to hold a formal sitting.
We shall consider, together with the Group Chairmen, the possibility of organising a major fundamental debate at our part-session next week.
I should also like to say that I naturally take a very positive view of the suggestion made to me to establish a book of condolence addressed to our colleagues in the American Congress.
That book will be placed at the exit of the Chamber tomorrow morning at 10.00 a.m.
I should like to offer my most heartfelt thanks to Prime Minister Verhofstadt, to Minister Louis Michel, to Mr Romano Prodi, and to all of you, and declare this formal sitting closed.
(The sitting was closed at 6.10 p.m.)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament, adjourned on Wednesday 12 September 2001.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sittings
The Minutes of the sittings of Thursday 6 and Wednesday 12 September 2001 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Madam President, although I know that we have more important things to do today, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, on 6 September, I raised objections to the Minutes of the previous day and also asked - with a view to having these issues in general clarified, and not just this particular instance - that the committee responsible for dealing with agenda questions be asked to look into the matter of a vote result being retrospectively altered.
Towards midday, I raised another objection and referred to my first one, but I have to date received no reply, and I do think that a Member is entitled to be given answers.
So I ask you firstly: do you think that a Member is entitled to be given answers when he raises objections? And secondly: when can I expect to receive one?
Yes, Mr Swoboda, of course.
I believe that Members are entitled to receive a reply to their comments and I can assure you that this matter will be sorted out.
Madam President, of course Mr Swoboda is entitled to receive an accurate reply.
I just want to ask your services to give it on the basis of the midday debate.
Not to be too blunt about it, I had the feeling that Mr Swoboda, on the day itself, tried to use an amendment of the Minutes to change the outcome of this House's vote.
For this reason, I ask that the midday debate should be taken as the basis of any answer your services give to Mr Swoboda, and please be so kind as to let me have a copy of it.
I am quite sure that your services understood perfectly well what this House had in mind!
Mr Jarzembowski, we shall look into the whole matter very carefully.
(The Minutes were approved)
Tribute
Ladies and gentlemen, Commander Massoud visited the European Parliament on 4 April 2001.
He was recently assassinated in a cowardly attack by his opponents, a few days before the terrible attacks on New York and Washington.
I had invited him because he embodied the hopes of the overwhelming majority of people in Afghanistan for a future of peace and freedom.
He had warned us against the Taliban regime' s tacit support for international terrorism and he did everything in his power to fight against those who misused Islam in order to flout the most basic human rights.
He sent a strong message to us to help him to establish peace as soon as possible.
I regret that the West did not heed this message and did not do more to help this brave man.
Many of you met him and were impressed by his intellect and his human qualities.
I would like to ask you to pay tribute to him by observing a minute' s silence.
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to a communication that I shall now give to you on security measures at the European Parliament.
As you know, the dreadful terrorist attacks in the United States have fuelled quite legitimate feelings of concern within the European Parliament itself.
The Sunday Telegraph even reported that we were the target of very serious threats, which had been thwarted.
I would like to confirm that the European Parliament has never known of any threats.
On Monday, the prefect of the Bas Rhin department called me personally in order to tell me that he formally denied that these threats had been made.
As you know, the French authorities also formally denied the threats, as confirmed in an official press release.
I would add that the British Secret Services also claimed that they had no knowledge of them.
In fact, I intend to send a letter to the editor of the Sunday Telegraph to protest against the newspaper publishing such serious and inaccurate information.
I can assure you, however, that the staff of the Bureau are constantly monitoring the issue of security of the European Parliament, the vice-presidents, the Quaestors, the President and General Secretariat.
We took a number of measures to increase security, particularly in December 2000, at Christmas, when there were rumours circulating that Strasbourg cathedral was a target.
Given that the cathedral is close by, a series of measures was of course taken at that time.
Immediately after the events of 11 September, the Secretary-General and I were in contact, and we have introduced additional measures to further increase checks on people and luggage at the entrances of the three European Parliament buildings.
I would add that we are, of course, in constant contact with the other European institutions as well as with the governments of the host countries of the European Parliament.
Lastly, the Bureau is meeting this evening in order to consider a series of new measures proposed by the Secretary-General which aim to extend - and I did say 'extend' - security measures.
I trust everyone will cooperate so these necessary measures are a success.
Thank you in advance.
Welcome
It is my pleasure to welcome Mr Moussa TourÃ©, President of West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA), who is seated in the public gallery.
The UEMOA, whose structure is closely modelled on that of the European Union, plays a key role in the organisation of regional cooperation in West Africa.
This is why we hope to build further on the links that already exist between this organisation and the European Union.
This is the aim of Mr TourÃ©' s visit, and I would like to extend a very warm welcome to him.
Combating terrorism
I would like to welcome Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, Minister for European Affairs and President-in-Office of the Council.
I would also like to welcome Commissioner Vitorino.
The next item is the Council and Commission statements with a view to the informal and extraordinary meeting of the European Council on Friday 21 September, on the measures needed to tackle terrorism.
I shall now give the floor to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, its citizens and its institutions are still deeply shocked by the terrorist attack on the United States on Tuesday 11 September 2001.
The Presidency and the Council immediately condemned, in the strongest possible terms, the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these barbaric acts.
The strikes against the American nation are a direct attack on the values of democracy, tolerance, respect for human rights and the rule of law that are shared by America and Europe, and upon which our societies and others elsewhere in the world, are based.
At its emergency session on Wednesday 12 September, the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers expressed its profound solidarity with the American people.
We clearly stated that no effort would be spared to identify, bring to justice and punish those responsible.
To achieve this aim, the European Union will have to use and strengthen a number of operational instruments of our Common Foreign and Security Policy and our Justice and Home Affairs policy.
Terrorism is an international problem and as such requires a global response.
Madam President, at the instigation of the General Affairs Council, the Council of Transport Ministers held a meeting on 14 September.
The Council reviewed the urgent measures taken by each Member State in order to guarantee the safety of air travel.
It also set up a special working group, comprising representatives of the Member States and of the European Commission, which is responsible for increasing cooperation and coordination among the Member States to ensure the uniform and effective application of security measures, including by legislative means.
A preliminary report on this subject is to be laid before the Council of Transport Ministers meeting scheduled for 15 October next.
Lastly, the Transport Ministers have decided to draw up common proposals on the subject of security measures. On behalf of the Union, these proposals will then be put to the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on 25 September next.
The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will meet on 20 September.
It will assess the intelligence-sharing mechanism and the respective roles in this context of institutions such as Europol and Eurojust, as well as assessing the two proposals for framework decisions it received from the Commission.
The first proposal concerns the approximation of criminal law in the Member States with a view to developing a common definition of terrorist action and establishing a common system for punishing criminal acts.
The second proposal concerns the introduction of a European warrant of arrest.
The Council will consider instruments employed in the investigation of criminal acts and will ensure that a suitable balance is struck between the protection of privacy and the needs of the investigative authorities.
Finally, the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will examine a number of measures aimed at strengthening transatlantic judicial cooperation in the areas of policing, intelligence and immigration.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism requires the use of all kinds of instruments to monitor financial flows, to identify suspects, to make air travel safer, to monitor arms trafficking as well as many other aspects.
The European Union is the best placed organisation to provide a global response to the fight against terrorism.
The fight against international terrorism will be a long, drawn-out battle.
As the Heads of State and Governments have stated, the European Union will have to assume an even greater role in managing regional tension and conflicts if it is to stamp out international terrorism.
The inclusion of fragile nations and regions in a peaceful world governed by the rule of law will be a powerful weapon in the battle against the scourge of terrorism.
The EU will be much more effective if it can further develop its Common, Foreign and Security Policy and can activate its Common European Security Policy at the earliest opportunity.
The Common, Foreign and Security Policy will have to be used preventatively, rather than as a means of reprisal.
If the battle against terrorism is to be truly effective, we will also need to strengthen our policies with regard to the countries and the regions of the world that appear to nurture terrorism.
We will have to enhance and deepen our political dialogue and use every possible means at our disposal to combat, stifle and finally eradicate international terrorism.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is an emerging world power.
As such we have a greater number of responsibilities, which we must shoulder together.
The tragic events of 11 September 2001 will also prompt us to develop closer ties with the United States, which will go beyond the established mechanisms for cooperation.
The transatlantic dialogue will enable us to exchange information and share our respective assessments of the threat posed by terrorism, in all its guises.
The Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Louis Michel, will travel to Washington this evening for talks with the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, on transatlantic cooperation.
He will report back on his meeting to the extraordinary meeting of the European Council, which is scheduled for Friday 21 September.
This extraordinary meeting of the European Council was called to review all the political, diplomatic, economic, legal and financial resources that are at the Union' s disposal to combat terrorism.
The Council will also be an opportunity to reflect on the EU' s diplomatic role in stabilising regional conflicts.
In order to be effective, the fight against terrorism must be able to rely on the efforts of all the countries that share our values of freedom, tolerance and democracy.
For this reason, the Presidency has sought to ensure that third countries are fully involved in the actions taken by the European Union.
The candidate countries unanimously backed the declarations of the General Affairs Council and the declarations made by the Heads of State and Government.
Third countries have also been invited, via the foreign embassies of Member States, to confirm their commitment to the unrelenting fight against terrorism.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union can thus help to build a world of peace and legality for all nations.
(Applause)
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is actively preparing for the European Council meeting to be held next Friday, an important part of which is tomorrow' s European Union troika meeting in the United States.
This is why my colleague Chris Patten, who hoped to give a speech on external relations with particular emphasis on the fight against terrorism, could not attend this debate.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to stress that we support the principle that the Union must make more effort to give a consistent message where the fight against terrorism is concerned and that we need a European agenda to acknowledge the key role that must be assigned to the United Nations Organisation in the fight against global terrorism.
That is why we welcome the initiative by the Belgian Presidency to schedule an extraordinary and informal meeting of the European Council for next Friday and we are pleased to take part in today' s debate in the European Parliament.
We must show the American people and the American authorities that they have the solidarity of the whole European Union.
But in order for the Union to influence the guidelines on the fight against terrorism, we must give a consistent message.
Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon.
The threats are new, however, and the tools used by the terrorists are new and more sophisticated.
The tragic events in the United States of America sadly demonstrate the timeliness of the two proposals that were today approved by the Commission, which are closely related and which are also in response to a request by the European Parliament that was approved at the September plenary session in Strasbourg.
I would like to clarify that our proposals are not a response to the events that occurred in the United States of America.
The proposals are primarily a response to the fact that, even in our Member States, we have problems regarding terrorism that we must resolve.
The Commission has been working on these proposals for more than a year, working closely with the European Parliament, and we would like to stress that these proposals will help Europe to co-operate in a much more effective manner in the fight against terrorism, and therefore to collaborate in the fight at international level.
Terrorism constitutes one of the greatest threats to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and free economic and social development.
In recent years, we have witnessed an increase in terrorist activities both within the European Union' s borders and worldwide.
This increase in the power of terrorism is characterised by a profound change in the nature of terrorist attacks.
The actual or potential effects of armed attacks are increasingly devastating and fatal.
The increased dependence of our society on technological evolutions is giving rise to new forms of terrorism.
Increasingly, terrorism stems from the activities of networks operating at international level, which have very close links with other types of organised crime based in several countries, exploiting the legal loopholes arising from the geographical limits of investigations and sometimes enjoying extensive logistical and financial support.
Today more than any other time, therefore, we need measures to fight against this scourge.
The Treaty on European Union expressly lays down that the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice shall include progressively adopting measures establishing rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the field of terrorism.
The European Parliament recently adopted a resolution, which shows the determination of representatives of European citizens to conduct a fierce and effective battle against terrorism.
The Commission is proposing a two-fold response:
First of all, we are proposing a common definition of acts of terrorism and to set across the Member States levels of penalties that reflect the seriousness of these acts.
Terrorists take advantage of any differences in legal treatment in the Member States, particularly where the offence is not referred to in one of the State' s national legislation.
We must admit that the situation is very different from one Member State to another.
Most Member States have no specific regulations on terrorism and terrorist acts are punished as common offences.
On the other hand, six Member States have specific laws or legal instruments concerning terrorism where the words 'terrorism' or 'terrorist' are expressly mentioned.
The Commission' s proposal for a framework decision on terrorism aims to introduce approximation in this area and it provides a list of offences from murder to other actions that can be equally devastating, albeit more insidious, and which are described as terrorist acts if intentionally committed by individuals or by groups against one or more countries, their institutions or people, with the aim of intimidating them and seriously altering or destroying the political, economic or social structures of a country or to destroy them.
It is proposed that such acts incur prison sentences ranging from a minimum of 2 years to 20 years of prison depending on the severity of the offence.
Secondly, the Commission is presenting a proposal of a horizontal nature, a fairly ambitious proposal, I must admit, which is to replace the traditional extradition procedures by a system of surrendering persons to judicial authorities on the basis of a European arrest warrant.
This proposal, which also supplements the proposal on terrorism although its scope is wider, is based on the principle of mutual recognition of judgments, which the Tampere European Council hoped would become the cornerstone of European judicial cooperation.
The underlying idea is that where the judicial authority of one Member State requests the surrender of a person, either for final sentencing or because this person is undergoing criminal proceedings, the decision must be recognised and executed throughout the European Union in order to simplify and accelerate procedures as far as possible.
A time limit of three months is proposed and the reasons for refusing extradition are to be restricted to a limited number.
In particular, the principle of double criminal liability and the exception in favour of nationals are to be abolished.
The most important criterion in the European Union is not that of nationality but that of a person' s place of residence.
The proposal thus seeks to facilitate, wherever possible, the execution of the sentence in the country of arrest, if that is where the person is most likely to be successfully reintegrated into society.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, tomorrow I shall have the opportunity to present these proposals to the ministers at the extraordinary Council meeting called by the Belgian Presidency to discuss the European Union' s contribution to the fight against the threat of terrorism.
The benefit of this meeting is that it provides us with the opportunity to ask the ministers questions of principle at a political level and to try to resolve them.
This concerns our legislative proposals as well as a whole raft of measures that should be taken in order to step up our action at an operational level and to improve and make more effective our collaboration with our partners.
As you know, the Commission does not have any experience at an operational level, but it believes that the European Union should take a number of measures internally, including to ensure that Europol becomes an operational instrument in the fight against the various forms of crime, one of which is terrorism.
For this to be done, we must implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on Europol, which provide for its participation in joint enquiry teams and the possibility of inviting Member States to launch investigations, which also requires a major review of the content of the Europol convention, including questions of judicial control and democratic control.
We need strong commitment from the Member States straight away in order to establish genuine and effective cooperation between their intelligence services and to demonstrate that they share mutual trust.
This is also necessary in order to bring about a significant improvement in the conditions in which Member States' police and intelligence services provide Europol with the information needed to carry out their work, the most important part of which, in my opinion, is the prevention of terrorist acts.
Furthermore, it is important for the Union to strengthen international cooperation and this will involve taking all the necessary measures regarding judicial assistance, extradition, police and judicial cooperation in order to improve our ability to pre-empt and fight international terrorism.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, these are some ideas formulated by the Commission and which were put to the European Parliament and the European Council.
At this difficult time when the citizens of our Member States are, I am sure, contemplating an uncertain and insecure future, I believe that the best political message we can give them is that this gives us a unique opportunity to show that the European project really does have an added value and that is to guarantee them a future of freedom, security and justice.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats greatly welcomes the special summit of Heads of State and Government to be held on Friday at the Belgian Presidency's initiative, and you, Madam President, will of course be there too, to speak for the European Parliament.
We in the European Parliament can take real pride in passing the Watson Report in the last part-session; it points the way ahead for our common struggle against terrorism.
Next Friday's summit here in Brussels should, in many ways, be a signal.
It should again signal to our American friends that the diabolical attacks on Washington and New York were not only an assault on the United States, but on the whole of the civilised world and on every one of us.
These attacks struck at our ideals of democracy, human rights and peace.
What was said in our deeply moving session last week is still true today.
In the Conference of Presidents this morning, I asked the High Representative, Mr Solana - who is at this very moment on his way to Washington with Mr Michel and Mr Patten - to tell Secretary of State Powell, when they meet, that we, the freely-elected Parliament of Europeans in the European Union, expressed our solidarity in the immediate aftermath of these fearful events.
In Washington, however, we will also say that we expect not only decisions to be announced there for our European leaders to take note of, but also genuine discussions and consultation to take place, so that whatever action is necessary, and responsibility for it, may be shared by Europeans and Americans.
Madam President, I have the highest respect for Mr Solana.
In future, however, we must ensure that we can debate with the High Representative of the European Union here in the European Parliament as well.
I believe there is room for improvement here.
Friday's summit must also send a signal to the Middle East.
We urge Israel and the Palestinians to hold talks now.
Now is not the time to refuse to hold talks, or to cancel them, but a time for dialogue and confidence-building measures, so that peace may be achieved there.
(Applause)
We must repeat: those who now refuse dialogue shut themselves out from our sympathy and solidarity.
At this time most of all, we need peace developments and confidence-building measures in the Middle East.
(Applause)
We need a signal to the Arabic and Islamic world.
Our group's Bureau met this morning and decided to recommend to you, Madam President, that we should, as a European Parliament, meet as soon as possible with parliamentarians from the Arabic and Islamic world in the context of the Mediterranean Forum, that is to say, with those States with which we are linked in the Barcelona process and in the Mediterranean Dialogue.
Allow us now to send this signal, so that they may know that we seek partnership and friendship.
Let me now turn to another aspect, which I believe must be the essential operational content of the summit here in Brussels on Friday.
Mr Vitorino, we thank you for presenting these proposals today.
We must make Europol into a real instrument for combating crime, and we urge Member States to give Europol the information it needs to do this, something which has not happened in the past.
As we know, only one Member State does this reasonably adequately at present; the others have to date refused to.
We are very much in favour of introducing a European arrest warrant, and now is the time to act.
If there is anyone who now wants to stop Europeans going from strength to strength, who does not support European cooperation in the name of Europol, then they are fundamentally denying solidarity not only to Europeans, but also to our American friends, because in combating crime we must also be united against terrorism, if we are to stand alongside our American friends and partners.
(Applause)
For this reason, our group has tabled an amendment to the Budget for the year 2002.
We want to put the necessary resources at Europol's disposal to enable it to be truly operationally effective.
The time for words is now past!
We must act as Europeans.
At the same time, however, we must act calmly and with deliberation, and above all we must resolve conflicts peacefully wherever we can.
A military operation is never an act of retaliation, but must always lead to greater security.
Let us act calmly and with deliberation, but let us act consistently, and above all let us make our contribution to the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the Earth!
(Applause)
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last week we formally expressed our sympathies for all the victims of these attacks, who came from America, Europe and the whole of the world; we expressed our solidarity with the United States and, now, with pain but also with determination, we must respond to global terrorism, to this mixture of fanaticism and advanced technology which threatens our civilisation and our open, democratic and multicultural society.
We must send a very clear message to our fellow citizens: terrorism can injure, it can kill, but no democracy has ever been destroyed by terrorism and that is our greatest strength.
We must therefore work together: Parliament produced the Watson report, the Commission has speeded up its work and this week a Special Council has been called.
I must stress that yesterday and today the President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian Minister for External Affairs, Mr Michel, the High Representative for the CFSP, Mr Solana, and the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Patten, have taken part in debates in Parliament on this issue.
I believe that we should welcome this willingness to participate, which increases transparency and communication.
We Socialists must respond on the basis of one fundamental notion: the global response must be based on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368 of this year, which establishes that we must work together to bring the organisers, sponsors and perpetrators of the attacks and their accomplices to justice.
This is the basis of the worldwide coalition which we are building with the United States, with the candidate countries, with Russia and with all the states of the world which share our universal values.
I would add another point: the ratification of the International Criminal Court must be accelerated so that we may have a global instrument of justice in this very field.
We must also work firmly and with perseverance, acting within the framework of a multidimensional policy which relates to what we are doing in the United Nations.
This explains NATO' s decision to invoke Article 5.
We must state that poverty, injustice or conflict are not causes which can justify barbarism.
No conflict between East and West, between Islam and Christianity, between the traditional and the modern, can explain why killing innocent people can bring progress in the world.
I believe that the European Parliament, those of us sitting here from different peoples, of different beliefs, ideologies and religions, demonstrates that we Europeans have found a response to fanaticism and intolerance.
What can be done to create our policy? A series of contributions have been made here.
The Commission has brought forward certain measures and there are others which the Commission and the Council could activate more quickly. For example, they could speed up the implementation of the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam, they could speed up the ratification of the international conventions against terrorism - and this also falls within the competence of the Member States - and in particular the convention for the suppression of terrorist funding.
It must not be the case, as appears to be happening, that we are assisting in the funding of terrorist organisations through stock exchange speculation.
There must also be increasing cooperation between intelligence services and a strengthening of Europol.
Finally, Madam President - and this must be stressed - on the basis of the information given us by Mr Solana this morning, we must activate and pursue our policy of finding an opening, an opportunity, for peace in the Middle East, founded on the Mitchell report.
Confidence-building measures must not be viewed as recompense, but rather such measures must be an integral part of this process.
And we must do so jointly with the United States.
We must send them the message that they should not hide behind imaginary shields, that they should share with us in the responsibility to achieve a world which lives in peace, justice, freedom and security.
(Applause)
Madam President, last week's attacks on innocent civilians in New York and Washington shocked and outraged the civilised people across the world.
They show the difficulties faced by any state, especially a democracy, in defending its citizens against terrorists.
These atrocities and the subsequent search for those responsible also highlight the weaknesses of our defence of the civilian population and throw into sharp relief the painfully slow progress of EU cooperation in justice and home affairs, so boldly trumpeted in Amsterdam and in Tampere.
As the Americans seek the arrest of people on European soil who may be responsible, they must shake their heads in disbelief at the multitude of bilateral extradition agreements, which they will need to employ.
I welcome Commissioner Vitorino's statement.
The proposals he has put forward today take on board the key recommendations of the report we adopted on 5 September, to which Mr Poettering so kindly referred.
They deserve urgent consideration and swift action by Justice and Home Affairs Ministers at their meeting tomorrow.
If they are adopted by Council, they will represent a major step forward in forging a common EU anti-terrorism policy.
I challenge any minister who may resist these proposals in the secrecy of the Council chamber to explain publicly to citizens in their own country, or across Europe, why they are holding up effective common action in this field.
However welcome and important the Commission's proposals are, they are clearly insufficient.
They provide answers to the world as it was before last Tuesday.
They deal with terrorist crimes within the Union but do nothing to improve cooperation with countries outside the EU.
They fail to solve conflicts of competence between judicial authorities.
They leave cooperation and the vital matter of police affairs subject to a national veto, as Commissioner Vitorino said.
If the EU is serious about combating terrorism, we must gear up the operational instruments of common action.
We must enable Europol to cooperate effectively with third countries.
We must give an external dimension to Eurojust.
We must act decisively too, to combat money laundering in the conciliation currently under way and we must develop common policies for the collection and sharing of criminal intelligence, as Mrs Neyts pointed out.
Measures are needed too in foreign and security policy: greater cooperation in the UN, in the G8, in the Council of Europe, urging Member States to sign the UN Convention on the financing of terrorism; export controls on sensitive products and tighter association agreements with third countries.
But we must guard against a blurring of the second and the third pillars, which last week's Council declaration suggested, and guard too against upsetting the delicate balance between the needs of security and the civil liberties, which our citizens enjoy.
I ask whether now is not the time to consign to the rubble of history the clumsy, outdated second and third pillars of the EU cooperation and make their contents core competences of the European Union.
(Applause)
The fig leaf of national sovereignty serves only to hide the impotence of nation states.
Democracy faces supranational challenges and these require a supranational response.
Our policies will need public support, so our policymaking will need proper democratic oversight and control.
I believe that this House stands ready to play its part.
We must now call on our national leaders to show the courage and the vision which the moment demands.
(Applause)
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group and I believe, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, that the need to see the European Union display its character and show how useful it can be in world affairs has never been so great.
The coming period - perhaps the next few days - will certainly provide it with the opportunity to display its determination and ability to face three challenges, in particular, which are posed by this tragic situation.
I believe that the first challenge will be for countries to decide to be willing partners of the United States.
At yesterday' s debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, one of my colleagues spoke of 'allied but not aligned countries' .
This does not mean, of course, that they lack the necessary and legitimate solidarity, particularly in the common fight to seek out, judge and punish those responsible for this act of barbarism or, more generally, to break up the terrorist networks.
On the other hand, this means that we must have the courage to make clear to our American counterparts what we are perfectly willing to do and what do not sanction under any circumstances.
Yesterday and this morning, Mr Solana quite rightly stressed that it is vital that our fight against terrorism is not perceived by those in the Arab and Muslim world as a war against their civilisation, or even as a crusade, to use one of the most alarming expressions of President Bush.
Yesterday, the High Representative for the CFSP already recommended, in the same spirit, that we should be careful, that we should seek to humiliate nobody, avoid any confusion and not create rifts, which would be a huge mistake.
I welcome these responsible words.
My group hopes that these words will be translated into an outright refusal by the European Union to allow itself to be drawn into wartime thinking, into a trap which would produce more bloodshed and more innocent victims.
The second challenge that we must face is directly related to what I have just said.
We must avoid creating a division, but also review and revive the Euro-Mediterranean relationship.
Now is not the time, in my view, to discuss free-trade zones with our partners of the South-Eastern Mediterranean. We should instead talk about development, political dialogue, how to bring our societies closer and about human dignity.
And one of the practical commitments to make in line with this strategic choice is primarily to take concerted action to resolve the Middle East conflict fairly.
I appreciate the efforts made by Mr Solana and all the European Union representatives in the region.
These efforts are bearing initial fruit but we can all see that this situation is extremely fragile.
This is therefore the time to make every endeavour to work not against but in partnership with the United States and other actors, particularly in the region.
I believe that the third challenge we face is that of working on a new approach to international security.
Does the tragedy of 11 September not illustrate the failure of the way in which the world has been managed since the fall of the Berlin wall?
There are so many unresolved conflicts!
There are so many powerful but hidden forces at work!
There are so many destabilising forces!
Pursuing a unilateralist approach is not a response to this deep-rooted evil. We should combat it with genuine cooperation on a global scale which respects the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter.
Taking military action or clamping down with law and order is not the way to respond. We need an ambitious and multi-faceted policy for crisis prevention.
Citizens everywhere - in Africa, in the Mediterranean, in Latin America, in Eastern Europe, in the United States itself and often in the Member States - expect to see a revision of world governance.
At the moment, Europe, in particular, is being called upon to do this.
This is an opportunity to be seized.
From this perspective, the coming days could be the moment of truth.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe that we have already had the opportunity to discuss the root of the problem in the past and that we will have further opportunities to do so in the future.
In this debate, therefore, I shall not discuss the general philosophy of the course of action to take.
I would simply like to reiterate a few points, which some of our leaders now seem to have forgotten.
We must realise that our first problem is identifying our enemy.
We must not have any illusions - there are Islamic fundamentalists that have decided to carry out attacks against Western democracies.
We must be aware of this.
You must also be aware that there are more or less dormant terrorist organisations in all of our countries and they could very easily become active overnight.
In this respect, I would like to add something to the extremely interesting comments and thoughts of Commissioner Vitorino, and that is I hope the European Union will cease to subsidise the States that harbour or assist terrorists.
I believe that this is a practical step that we ourselves could take and one that could be taken fairly swiftly.
My second point is that we very clearly cannot contemplate taking any action worthy of that name, unless there is also sincere political cooperation between States, first and foremost between Member States of the European Union.
I can remember a time, not so long ago, and I am not sure that this period is behind us, when the 'every man for himself' mentality still prevailed and we accepted the presence of some organisations on our own soil on the condition that no action would be taken, even if this meant action would be carried out in a neighbouring country.
I therefore feel that we must have true solidarity and it must be clearly expressed.
My third point is that I believe we must realise that, in order for action combating terrorism to be worthwhile, it must be preventive.
We must, therefore, enhance the work of the intelligence services.
I listened very carefully to everything that was said earlier about the need for Europol to be effective.
I am fully in favour of enhancing Europol' s effectiveness, but this will not enable you to begin fighting against terrorism instantly.
We need genuine, immediate cooperation between the intelligence and security services, a sincere exchange of information and for States to be able to take the necessary measures, whatever some States might think - and, for the moment, it is the States who are responsible for security as part of their cooperation.
I shall not elaborate any further.
That is what I wanted to say this evening and I would stress one thing.
I have been listening to a philosophical debate on whether the action against the United States is an act of war or an act of terrorism.
Given the magnitude of these acts, I believe that they are acts of war.
And if we do not realise that they may well only be the first of many, then we will pay an extremely high price for our blindness.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the tragic events of 11 September do not only implicate the criminal organisation that carried out these dramatic attacks to express its hatred of the West, but they also reveal that there is immense frustration towards US Middle East policy, which dates back as far as 1991.
The United States has already lost some of its prestige by attacking Iraq for poor strategic reasons, and by failing to secure a victory.
It is primarily the United States' systematic alignment with the State of Israel' s expansionist policy, and which the Americans had tried to compensate for by supporting extremist Islamic organisations, that has caused a sense of the most profound injustice to spread throughout the Arab countries.
This means that the policy of colonisation put in place after the Six Day War as well as the unjustified presence of American troops in the region are therefore condemned.
Unless the State of Israel gives up its racist policy and evacuates the settlements established on the West Bank of Jordan, the Arab world, in response to a legitimate appeal, will rise up and will destabilise the leaders of the Arab peninsula.
And why is such importance given to the State of Israel, which has excessive military capabilities and only exists because of the will of the United States?
It is out of the question for France and Europe to take part in a new crusade against the Arab world, whether this takes the form of military action, extraditions or European arrest warrants.
France is not a member of NATO and NATO is not concerned by Afghanistan.
On the contrary, France will find its strategic interests lie in resolutely supporting the Arab world in its fight against racism in the policy pursued by the State of Israel.
Mr President, it is terrible what happened in New York and Washington.
We share in the grief and suffering of America.
The full scale of what exactly has happened is only just hitting home.
Within the European Union, it will be necessary for us to develop an anti-terrorist policy in harmony with the United States.
We owe this to the victims and those left behind.
I would therefore like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the speed with which proposals are now being submitted.
This fight is not a fight against Islam or its followers.
It is a fight against those who aim to reach their goals by terror, whatever so-called justification of their actions they try to put forward.
We must request unequivocally that all states and governments lend their unconditional support to this policy.
This fight is about the inviolability of human life as the highest value in our democracy.
I hope we can adopt this line in unison.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to make an effective contribution to the implementation of a global policy to fight international terrorism, as we say we do, the most effective way of doing this is surely to formally appeal to the Council to undertake an immediate examination of all the texts, particularly those which relate to the movement of people, from a security point of view rather than the perspective of the systematic abolition of checks.
However, this change of approach must apply to the forthcoming provisions and must also be evident through a systematic revision of the texts that have already been adopted, in the light of the need for the security and protection of our people, which is now a priority.
The Council must carry out this revision as soon as possible so that it can reform, and, if necessary, abolish all the provisions that may be used to establish and develop terrorist networks in our countries, whether they relate, for instance, to Community transit, border controls, family reunification or application for refugee status.
We cannot disregard the fact that people living on the fringes of the law are entering our countries and then also complain that terrorist networks are prospering on this breeding ground that we ourselves created.
We will have the opportunity tomorrow to align our actions with our words, since two reports are on the agenda, which contain recommendations that run counter to the requirement for security and for an anti-terrorism fight that we claim to want to prioritise.
We cannot possibly vote in favour of the Watson report, which has no explanatory statement, that dramatically widens the provisions on implementing the right to asylum, to the point where this essential right is changed beyond recognition and where the option to carry out checks is irresponsibly taken from Member States' authorities.
However, I would like to praise the courage of the first rapporteur, Mr Schmitt, who refused to have his name associated with such excesses.
In the same way, is this really the right time to adopt the Coelho report, the second paragraph of which calls on the United Kingdom and Ireland to abolish all their border controls as soon as possible?
Is this request not somewhat mistimed?
Ladies and gentlemen, we have the chance to be responsible and efficient by appealing to the Council to review our legislation in its entirety, in the light of the need for security.
Failing that, we can go into tomorrow' s debate trying not to be overly schizophrenic.
Mr President, as has been pointed out previously, we European citizens have witnessed, in astonishment and live on TV, a crime against humanity, as the president of my group pointed out, and an attempt to destroy our freedom and democracy.
The first thing we must do is to share in the pain of the American people.
Please allow me to say that we Spaniards fully understand the suffering of the victims.
But in the immediate aftermath we must react determinedly in order to defend our freedom and to do justice to the victims, showing the terrorists and their accomplices that their objectives have failed.
As in other eras of our history, it is essential that we reaffirm our democratic values in order to destroy the totalitarian course which terrorism takes us along.
The European Parliament has demonstrated its unequivocal commitment to combating terrorism, and the Watson report is a clear example of this.
But, now in particular, we must continue to put our political weight and impetus behind the concrete initiatives presented to us by the European Commission.
The President of my Group has presented certain budgetary initiatives aimed at strengthening the role of Europol.
Let us hope that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs - and I appeal to its Chairman - may, for its part, set an agenda allowing it to present to Parliament a proposal this year, which will allow the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies to finish their work in the coming months.
The European institutions have an inescapable responsibility to speed up procedures in order to provide the justice system with Community instruments which will make their work against terrorism and organised crime more effective.
The European Commission, and in particular Commissioner Vitorino, must be aware that it can count on the support of Parliament in order to guarantee concerted cooperation and action in tracking down these criminals, because this is the way to put an end to terror.
Mr President, as has been mentioned, on the 5th this Parliament approved the Watson report, with a series of measures which were essential to dealing with the issue of terrorism.
As has been mentioned here, a common definition of terrorism for all Member States, a European arrest warrant - which has been called for for some time - and the elimination of extradition seemed to us to be essential issues when Parliament asked for them on the 5th.
But in that same report Parliament also sent more than one political message to the other Community institutions: it asked for consideration of the fact that certain acts - and I quote - 'are orchestrated and carried out by groups organised at international level' and indicated that there were States behind these actions and that this must be confronted.
On 5 September, Mr President, this Parliament took the lead in asking the other institutions to adopt a firm attitude towards these issues.
We already had the commitment that Commissioner Vitorino would react positively.
On the 11th, Mr President, very soon afterwards, we realised that we had arrived late, dramatically late, and that the problem had exploded, not in the European Union, but in the United States, in an even more spectacular way - not dramatic, since it is always dramatic - than we have experienced here.
Mr Watson modestly tells us that what he asked for in his report is useful only within the European Union.
I do not agree.
I believe that, if we take this series of initiatives, we can make progress on an internal action which, as Mr Poettering said, would be a demonstration of our solidarity with the United States. If we, given the haste which is now required - and haste was already required - make more rapid progress in offering this example of how there can be an operational reaction on a supranational level in the fight against terrorism.
We will be sending the best indication of solidarity with the United States. We will be offering the best image, the best option for work in this supranational field against organised crime, as the United Nations recently requested in Palermo.
I hope that in the case of other measures, such as combating money laundering and so many others which are on the table in the Council, we will not wait until we have to act in haste, until there are other dramatic events, in order to implement them.
I believe that they are all essential to defending the world and, above all, freedom.
Mr President, when we visited Washington last week with this Parliament' s delegation, and stayed a few days longer than originally planned, not only myself but also our American colleagues became increasingly aware of a common interest.
I witnessed among the Americans, and certainly in their administration, more restraint than we generally give them credit for over here, or than we can infer from the sometimes unfortunately chosen words of the President.
Some of our American colleagues quite clearly said that the time for fine words is over.
I believe that they are right.
This is not only true of the relationship we have with them, but also of the action this Parliament intends to take.
If we want to talk about punishing terrorists, then we have, in fact, already missed the boat.
I hope that we can also talk about deterrence from time to time.
This would involve cooperation among police forces, examining magistrates and intelligence services.
Commissioner, I hope that your proposals will be dealt with as soon as possible, as I am sure they will be.
Then it will become clear who in this House is for or against cooperation, who truly wants to make headway and who does not.
