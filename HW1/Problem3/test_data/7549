The Commission feels that the newly tabled amendments would significantly weaken the support of the European Parliament for the proposed internal market approach.
In conclusion, I refer to the earlier discussion between Mrs Berger, Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen on the various merits and demerits of harmonisation, mutual recognition and the country of origin.
Large-scale harmonisation may waste time, prove unnecessarily bureaucratic and divert political goodwill and attention away from the key issues that Member States should agree on.
It may also contravene the subsidiarity principle in the Treaty.
On the other hand, it must be admitted that harmonisation may be necessary where there is a need to establish a high level of protection, notably for consumers.
Mutual recognition, on the other hand, can be made to work more satisfactorily if it is implemented through secondary Community legislation which clearly identifies the areas in which mutual recognition must be accepted.
Both principles have their merits and demerits, but by and large I am inclined to agree with Mr Harbour's view that the quickest way of achieving an adequate level of protection for the consumer is to adopt the country-of-origin principle.
In conclusion, may I thank Mr Beysen for his kind remarks on the sales promotion directive adopted by the Commission this week.
Lastly may I apologise to Mrs Berger for having omitted previously to thank her on the Commission's behalf for having withdrawn almost all of the amendments tabled on the previous matter.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Pre-contractual information on home loans
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0290/2001) by Mr Radwan, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the
Commission recommendation on pre-contractual information to be given to consumers by lenders offering home loans [C5-0256/2001 - 2001/2121(COS)]
Mr President, Commissioner, we have now reached the last item on the agenda and I hope that the crush of Members will not now be too much.
What is this report about?
It is about the question of precontractual information on home loans.
We are in the process of creating an EU internal market by 2005, and one of the objectives is that in future cross-border home loans should be offered and taken up by customers.
An agreement in the matter has been reached at European level between consumer associations and banking associations.
We need that to be put into effect relatively quickly.
It would be gratifying if that were to happen in less than twelve months.
I would like at this point to expressly highlight the positive role played by the Commission, which managed to bring the two sides together repeatedly and in the end achieve a result in this difficult moderation process.
This may become the first positive example of self-regulation in the European Union.
But there are still things that need to be done.
First, we must look at the moderation process itself. It took about four years and according to some participants was not always very transparent.
We call on the Commission to report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the experience gained from this moderation process and the conclusions to be drawn for future self-regulation processes.
As I have already said, it may be a positive example. But if it proves not to be a positive example of self-regulation, the Commission really will have to put forward its own proposal for a directive.
A few points are still outstanding here.
Firstly, of course, we need a commitment not only from the banking associations, but we need a Europe-wide commitment from the banks themselves.
The extent to which the banks will participate is an open question here.
Secondly, the register that is published must of course also be posted on the Internet.
We also need similar forms throughout Europe.
It is already foreseeable that some Member States that were very keen on producing a standard form, especially at the outset, will want to go their own way and may take a different route in future.
At all events, comparability must be preserved here, in the interests of the customer.
We ought to try to extend this agreement to the candidate countries.
We should also extend the mediation body you have just mentioned, Commissioner, to this field.
We should not retain the internal mediation body proposed in the agreements, but follow the Commission' s initiative here.
We also need comparability of data.
The effective annual interest rate in particular is highly important for the consumer.
The figure at the end is not the only important thing, but the basis on which it is calculated, too.
The effective annual interest rate is still calculated in different ways in Europe. We should work towards getting a uniform method of calculation.
I would very much welcome it if this did not have to come from the Commission, but if the banks themselves could manage to agree on a method within a very short space of time.
We should then also apply all this to services offered over the Internet.
We have, after all, just had the Huhne report, which also said we wanted to press forward with this.
We should have this information there in future, too.
And finally, as the Huhne report recommends, future legislation should be harmonised with the legal terms used in this code.
In conclusion I would like to stress that I very much welcome this voluntary code of conduct.
It now requires critical appraisal and monitoring.
We hope the Commission will before long present the Committee with a report on how successful the code has been and whether we can continue along that road or whether we must introduce legislation.
Mr President, I express my sincere appreciation of Mr Radwan' s motion for a resolution regarding pre-contractual information for home loans.
There is no doubt that work to reorganise and tidy up this rather confused sector has now begun. Unfortunately, some debatable if not downright censurable behaviour has been seen on the part of European lenders.
The importance of the work that has been done lies essentially in the fact that for the first time a collection of indications and regulations is not the result of self-regulation, as has often happened in the past.
I refer to the inter-bank agreements on conditions, in which the banks dictated the rules more so as not to have to face fierce competition within the sector rather than to set up transparent contractual schemes to supply to the end-customers, but by means of an agreement, even though a voluntary one, between banks and consumers' associations.
Also important is the choice of transparency and publicity laid down in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the Code itself, and especially Article 25, which states that an offer made over the Internet should be made in accordance with the European scheme and in compliance with all the provisions and indications that are laid down.
In conclusion, I should like to point out that this code will require further additions and corrections.
The practical stage will be to give the necessary indications.
I am just troubled by the fact that the committee did not accept an amendment I tabled to set a limit - the total amount - on the loan to be registered.
My reason for this amendment was the fact that in some Member States the credit institutions triple the loan figure registered compared with the amount actually lent, which is doubly harmful to the consumer: first, there is a question of image, in that, to an inexperienced person the debt might appear to be three times as large as it really is; and secondly, a matter of costs, particularly notarial costs, which are calculated on the registered amount of the loan.
I hope that in future this aspect can be reconsidered.
Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and thank him for his cooperation.
Completing the internal market for financial services and affording consumers a high level of protection is a Community priority.
Signing a home loan agreement is often the most important and the biggest financial obligation a consumer takes on in his working life.
We must therefore welcome the fact that a voluntary agreement has been reached at European level between banking and consumer associations on the duty to provide precontractual information.
That the code of conduct and the register of home loan providers to be kept by the Commission will also be made available on the Internet is also a positive move.
In this connection, in order to improve the comparability of consumer information, a precise definition of a common effective annual interest rate for home loans should be included in the European Standardised Information Sheet; it should be calculated in the same way throughout the Community and be consistent with the consumer protection directive.
The information sheet should be designed to include all the data needed to check how the loan is calculated.
This means, in particular, the manner in which advance and deferred interest is calculated.
That is one of the most important consumer policy concerns in this sector.
It is also desirable for Parliament to be included in talks about voluntary agreements in future so that absolute transparency can be guaranteed in drawing up the code of conduct.
I hope that this example of a voluntary agreement between market participants and consumer associations will prove successful so that it can be extended to other areas of financial services.
This will be a major contribution to the swift creation of the internal market in financial services.
But since the consumer side has relatively few resources available, concrete measures must be taken if the voluntary agreement is not kept.
Otherwise, the instrument of the voluntary agreement - a very good instrument in itself - might prove to be inexpedient because in the end the agreement is only kept by those who cause no problems anyway.
That alone would not be enough and would be of no benefit.
Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that the Commission is in a very comfortable position because it agrees entirely with the content of the resolution adopted almost unanimously on 28 August of this year by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The voluntary code of conduct which underpins the Commission's recommendation is the very first example of an agreement reached between banking and consumer associations on the standardisation of information which must be made available to consumers before a contract is concluded.
Its existence proves, as has rightly been pointed out in the resolution, that market participants are best placed to negotiate proper solutions and to ensure an appropriate balance of interests between contractual parties.
But however well placed they might be, market participants need a neutral and indefatigable broker to accompany, and sometimes remotivate them, during the long and difficult negotiations of this code.
Tribute has been paid by the rapporteur to the Commission's role and the Commission is duly appreciative and grateful to the rapporteur for that acknowledgement.
As agreed between and called for by all parties, the broker, that is, the Commission, will now transform itself into a notary and, if need be, into a referee.
As a notary, the Commission will, in line with the resolution, keep a register of home-loan lenders who adhere to the code.
That register will be kept up-to-date and made available online.
I say this in particular to Mr Radwan who wanted this code to be on the Internet and it will be.
It will be made available online on the Commission's website and appropriate transparency will therefore be ensured.
During the negotiation phase the lack of appropriate transparency was deplored in the report.
It is a point well taken by the Commission, but at least when the register is on the net then that transparency will be restored.
That is with the Commission as a notary.
As a referee the Commission will monitor compliance with its recommendation and assess its effectiveness.
The Commission made it clear in its recommendation that it will consider presenting binding legislation should the terms of its recommendation not be fully complied with.
Parliament will, as is rightly called for in the resolution, be closely informed - that also is a point that was raised tonight - about our monitoring and compliance-assessment work.
I am convinced that the code and our related recommendation will play a very significant role in the completion of the internal market for financial services to which Parliament regularly reiterates its support.
I am also hopeful, like the rapporteur, that this pioneer initiative, once again the first of its kind, will not be a one-off experience.
Its success will, however, depend on the commitment of all parties - and I am pleased to inform this Parliament that the number of companies having notified their adherence to the code is now already significant, although not entirely satisfactory in some Member States.
I can assure Parliament that the Commission will work hard in order to ensure adherence of the entire sector.
In conclusion, Mr Ettl has put forward certain wishes.
The Commission takes note of those wishes but would like to point out that this affair is restricted to precontractual information and therefore information on interest rates and so on is beyond the scope of this instrument.
So the Commission takes note of what Mr Ettl has just said but it does not see its way to complying with those wishes.
Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein, for your dedication to Parliament this evening.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 122, which allows the speaker three minutes.
I shall not abuse the Rule.
Yesterday, an Italian news agency reported a letter sent to President Fontaine by Mr Tajani regarding the speeches made during the debate of the Extraordinary Council of 21 September by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and myself.
First of all, I would ask you to check and find out whether the President received this letter.
In addition, I gather from the agency - because I have not read the letter - that our President is being asked to do something improper, which is to take an initiative in defence of the Italian Parliament.
I do not know with what prerogative the President of the European Parliament could do so.
I also assume that the Presidents of the Italian Parliament should be perfectly able to defend their own institutions.
I should like to make it clear, then, that neither Mr BarÃ³n Crespo nor I made any attack on that Parliament.
We did, however, point out what seemed to be extremely inconsistent behaviour on the part of the Italian Government, for, at Brussels, it did not submit any reservation when signing the action plan against terrorism at the close of the Extraordinary Council, nor did it raise any objection of the kind in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and yet Italy is promoting a law which makes judicial cooperation much more difficult.
The latter fact has been noted by prominent jurists, the international press and also, today, by the American judge, Mr Calabresi, head of the Court of Appeal in New York, who says that Italy is setting out in the opposite direction to that taken by the United States and the whole international community.
In any case, we freely expressed an opinion.
In the debate, Mr Tajani did the same, refuting these arguments with arguments of his own.
At this point, I frankly cannot see what our President should do other than uphold the prerogative of this Parliament, which, pursuant to Rule 2, guarantees the independence of the parliamentary mandate, and as neither I nor Mr BarÃ³n Crespo have violated any rule of behaviour laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I think Mrs Fontaine should do nothing.
It also seems odd to me that Mr Tajani should complain about alleged interference and then ask the President to do the same.
Having said that, I should like you, Mr President, to inform Mrs Fontaine that, before the end of this part-session, we would like to know if and how she intends to respond to Mr Tajani' s letter.
I shall, of course, inform the President of your request.
I am sure Mrs Fontaine will respond as soon as possible.
Mr President, a further personal statement.
I do not believe Mrs Fontaine needs lessons in parliamentary law to know what to do.
I refer to the letter that I sent to the President yesterday.
The agencies are not the source of the information, but rather the text of the letter that I sent to Mrs Fontaine to ask her if she thought it appropriate to intervene following certain statements made in this House by the President of the Socialist Group, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and other members of the same Group.
I do not think I mentioned Mrs Napoletano in the letter, but I do not mind contesting some of her statements.
The problem is not one of interference of the European Parliament in the Italian Parliament; it is that yesterday and the day before, that is since the beginning of this part-session, we have heard statements repeated in this House that interfere with the Italian Parliament.
Indeed, when someone asks repeatedly to check whether the laws that are passed are in accordance with the decisions of the Council of Ministers, and nobody questions the assessment of that Council, I repeat and continue to repeat, and I said so yesterday to Mrs Napoletano and the Socialist Group, who had spoken on an issue that concerns Italy' s internal affairs - the Italian Parliament, thank God, is still sovereign and must not be subjected to guardianship - that, in connection with the rules on international letters rogatory, the issue in question is about a verification of a law ratifying the agreement between Italy and Switzerland, and the basic law is that which implements Article 3 of the European Convention on Legal Assistance signed in Strasbourg by all the European countries and which has been in force in Italy since 1961.
Article 3 lays down the obligation of the country that receives a letter rogatory asking for legal assistance to send the petitioning country the originals of the documents having evidential value or, failing that, a copy with a certificate of authenticity.
This is not a matter of failing to combat terrorism: we have always been, as a political grouping and as the national government, the expression of this political movement with its Prime Minister strongly committed to fighting terrorism.
I would not like it to be said, wrongly, in this House, that the law being adopted implementing Article 3 of the European Convention on Legal Assistance, which has all too often been violated by magistrates in Italy, is actually a law favouring terrorism, because it is not.
Hence my request for Mrs Fontaine' s intervention, if she thinks fit.
The matter is now closed.
General product safety
The next item is the report (A5-0313/2001) by Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety [3644/2001 - C5-0298/2001 - 2000/0073(COD)].
Mr President, I do not think I will take up the whole five minutes.
This is a third reading and it is a conciliation procedure that we have been following for a long time.
I would like to welcome the dialogue that has existed between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, which has been very helpful.
Naturally, the result of a conciliation is never entirely good for all parties.
It is usually fairly good, but with a few drawbacks.
I believe that of the first amendments presented by the European Parliament at first reading, the other two institutions have accepted some important amendments.
For example, taking into account in product safety not only the producers' liability but also that of the distributors; clear information on the possible risks in the languages of the different States of the Union; faster exchange of information; greater cooperation between Member States to prevent dangerous products from reaching the market; and also, the withdrawal of products which are considered dangerous, even if they are already being marketed.
Furthermore, although not in the form that our colleagues from the United Kingdom wanted, an amendment aimed at including the special nature of several charities in the United Kingdom was accepted.
I believe that a major part of the European Parliament' s proposals were included.
However, not all of them were included, and at second reading we presented only seven amendments which intended to include what had not been accepted by the other institutions.
These amendments referred to something very important for us: the inclusion of the services in a proposal on which the Commission is working, the results of which it is committed to producing in 2003.
I believe this is a very important proposal for us, because safety of services should rank on the same level as the directive we are reviewing today.
We also need to take account of the precautionary principle; this means that when there is a well-founded suspicion that a product is not safe, we should apply this principle of precaution which people talk so much about and which is seldom applied in reality.
And the possibility that there is an external certificate which supplements the official certification.
There is also an agreement on comitology which in this case is not what Parliament wanted either, but there is a proposal of continued and regular information to the European Parliament and the Council.
Some matters which caused us concern in the final proposal were also clearly accepted.
I would just like to emphasise a matter proposed by the Commission itself at the beginning, which is the ban on exports to Third World countries of products which are not considered safe in Europe.
This proposal was not accepted by Parliament by a few votes, and is naturally not included in the final document.
I have to say, as rapporteur, that this is perhaps what concerns me most.
I believe that we run a real risk that, as we are seeing daily, unscrupulous people export to Third World countries products that are not safe.
This is an issue that is of enormous concern to me.
We have the verbal undertaking of the European Commission that there will be very strict controls to ensure that this does not occur, but it would have been safer for it to be included in the proposal and for there to be no risk of exporting products which we Europeans consider dangerous to Third World countries.
Therefore, Mr President, despite the rapporteur' s great regret that the express ban on the export of unsafe products to the Third World has not been included in the directive, I believe, as I said in the beginning, that it is not the best proposal for the Council and the Commission, perhaps it is not the best one for Parliament either, but it is the result of a conciliation procedure in which a very fruitful dialogue has indeed taken place between all the institutions and with which I am very satisfied.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the operation of the internal market is only guaranteed if, in an area without internal borders, appropriate and sensible measures are put in place and consumer safety is safeguarded.
We need uniform safety standards, not a range of different standards. The proposal before us is intended to create these uniform standards.
In recent years, consumer confidence has been badly dented, firstly by various acts of fraud against consumers, and secondly by the very welcome research in this area.
This has repeatedly revealed that some consumer goods on the market no longer complied with current safety criteria.
It is therefore even more important and necessary that this report is before us today. Our thanks are due to the rapporteur, whose efforts have made this possible.
It is very important that this general product safety directive should apply irrespective of the type of marketing undertaken, and that a decision is taken which reflects developments in the market place and therefore also includes distance marketing and electronic commerce.
As regards the issue of consumer safety, the task is not only to protect children and older persons as the weaker groups in our societies, which is always emphasised; safety standards must apply to everyone.
It is therefore only right and proper that we should seek to ensure that goods which no longer meet our safety standards and have to be withdrawn from sale do not end up by circuitous routes in third countries where they could pose a risk to health.
I think that one of the most important points arising in this context is the involvement of the trade.
Ensuring compliance with these current safety criteria cannot take place solely via the public authorities; the dealers themselves must play their part in ensuring that this relationship of trust between dealer and consumer is enhanced and improved in future.
However, this will still require appropriate controls, and the directive is only as good as its regulation.
Monitoring measures will therefore be very important.
This network of regulatory bodies in the Member States is essential, and we hope that it will come into operation as quickly as possible.
Let me add one final point, namely the speed of response by the European Parliament and the European institutions to this type of emergency and the consumer protection which had become necessary in the wake of the BSE crisis, foot and mouth disease, and other types of consumer fraud.
We have been discussing this issue for nearly a year now, and I think we should consider how we can respond to emergencies more quickly and introduce urgently-needed measures, and perhaps also how we can improve and, above all, speed up our internal processes and inter-institutional processes in this context.
Mr President, for those of us who have sat through the discussions in this conciliation, Mr Ebner's comments have come as a welcome and positive contribution to our deliberations.
For those of us who have to explain back home how this Parliament influences legislation, the timetable and content of the general product safety directive could be something of a model.
Progress here has been relatively swift; the Commission proposal submitted 15 months ago has now gone through every stage, with all of the three parts which make up the triangle of forces involved now having made their own distinctive contributions.
Secondly, as regards Parliament, there is the rapporteur.
Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez has taken a consistent, thorough and dedicated line throughout the passage of this legislation through Parliament.
She has known when to hold firm and when to make concessions.
Those of us who have felt that occasionally we did not prevail when we should, owe it to her that the door is open for further and better changes after these initial steps.
Twenty-one of our thirty amendments have been accepted by the Council.
I am particularly grateful, in respect of the UK, for the clarified exemption for charity shops and street markets from the obligation to provide information on origin, which would have been beyond them.
This was not a Community-wide problem, but in countries like the Irish Republic and Britain it mattered very greatly, and much good has been done by the clarification provided.
We have the clear recognition now of the precautionary principle itself.
There was an uncommon delay before the other institutions were prepared even to write this into the preambles, but they have done so and it is now one of the markers which will guide us as we look at how product safety legislation develops.
We were not as successful as I would have wanted on withdrawal and recall, and we shall return to that and other matters later.
It is important that we should be required to consider the safety of services and to examine proposals to this end in reasonably quick time.
In this we were simply holding the Commission to a principle which it supported in theory, but must now deliver in practice by 2003.
At the same time, we shall have to look hard at the failure to ban the export of unsafe products to the rest of the world, as the rapporteur has said, and the nature of the safety indications which imported products have to carry.
One has only to look at the CE mark to see the imperfections there.
This was one step forward, but an important one.
I congratulate the rapporteur.
She has certainly earned our quality mark in these debates.
Mr President, I would like to express my support and that of my Group for the report from the Conciliation Committee.
I also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez, who has done an excellent job.
The report before us makes for a significant improvement on current legislation governing the safety of products.
Of the points agreed, I particularly welcome the fact that stronger action can now be taken at Community level under the rapid alert system where there is a serious risk to consumers, so that dangerous products can be taken off the market.
It is important that we have adequate and independent certification to comply with the relevant product safety criteria and clear labelling for consumers.
The fact that the Commission will be reporting regularly to Parliament is significant, as is the reference to the precautionary principle and the duty of the relevant authorities in Member States to interpret this in relation to all products.
My Group believes that all consumers, both within and outside the European Union, should be treated equally.
As the rapporteur has stressed several times during discussions on this directive, safety should be assured for all consumers.
I am also glad that agreement has been reached on antique and charity shops and car boot sales, as by their nature they cannot provide information about second-hand goods but do provide a very valuable service.
Overall, we need a good balance between ensuring that products put on the market are safe and seeing to it that the measures proposed to that end can be implemented in practice.
This report partially achieves that and the consumer organisations which have welcomed earlier drafts of this directive will welcome this one, too.
Our top priority is to ensure that consumers are protected and that they have the right to know which products are dangerous and what is being done about them.
This report makes significant improvements to existing legislation and hopefully will have the support of Parliament.
Mr President, strong competition, increasing concentration and globalisation are now key features of manufacturing industry around the world.
This creates great advantages, but also disadvantages, for the consumer.
Although there are numerous institutions in the EU Member States which are responsible for quality assurance and consumer product regulation, product recall is unfortunately becoming far more common.
The purpose of this report is to enforce the precautionary principle in respect of any product placed on the market, and identify suitable approaches.
I myself am a producer of consumer goods and so I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for her proposed solutions, for the task is to protect producers as well as consumers.
One option is to harmonise the regulations governing the authorities responsible for product safety.
The network of information which will be required in this context will be broad.
It is therefore appropriate to expand the existing directive first of all and revise it after a thorough appraisal of the situation.
The market cannot be regulated. This is why preventive safety and health measures are especially important.
The report contains numerous references to the fact that in the Member States, operators' and producers' rights take precedence over the rights of consumers.
The purpose of the report is to change this situation. I fully support this objective.
Due to the wide range of products available and the resulting risks to consumer safety and health, a new legislative approach is required.
The report makes no secret of this fact. It also makes it clear that an export ban must be adopted for dangerous products.
This issue has yet to be considered in detail, and in my view, the proposed period until 2003 is not too long for this process.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the spirit in which Members have spoken in this House today, and also on previous occasions, over months and even longer, in addressing this issue. It is surely one of the issues which European and, I might say, world public opinion cares about most, as well as being one of the most important for Europe' s identity.
There are arguments on which Europe has intervened effectively but which do not receive the general support of public opinion and the citizens.
There are other, more specific and sector-based topics, on the other hand, which have received approval.
This, however, is a general topic which has received the general support of the citizens.
On reading the documentation relating to this procedure as a whole, on how it developed and how it is concluded today, I find a vagueness in many chapters and recitals, as well as in many expressions that are or will be binding on this subject.
It is a vagueness that is quite common in acts of the European Parliament, the Commission or the Council, but which, in this case, could perhaps have been more fully corrected.
My concern is not the delay in reaching the position that is emerging today in the report, but rather that more specific detail should be given regarding interventions, the form these take, controls and the procedures by which they are enforced, and the flexibility and dignity of the controls - in other words they should not be humiliating for the producer or the consumer.
I think that, in this sense, we could have been more specific and, at the same time, more respectful of the rights of producers and distributors, but always, of course, in the consumer' s interest.
For instance, I find that expressions such as 'dangerous' and 'serious risk' are insufficient; they could certainly be used in a standard or a regulation - at national or other levels - but, as these arguments are so delicate and liable to affect the daily lives of consumers and thus of society and the community, we could, perhaps, have been more explicit.
As for the future, bearing in mind what I have said regarding controls, I think that the three-yearly report required of the Commission should be drawn up at shorter intervals, without waiting three years, so as to prevent situations from arising over the three years that need to be remedied with specific provisions.
That is why I believe that this point may warrant further consideration.
Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Commission's endorsement of the outcome of the Conciliation Committee.
This directive recasts an existing directive of 1992, which has now been updated, reinforced and completed.
The overall aim of this directive is to impose a general obligation to market only safe products and to ensure both a consistent and a high level of protection of consumer health and safety throughout the EC and the proper functioning of the internal market.
Improvements in consumer health and safety represent one of the political priorities announced by this Commission.
The directive before you today is framed within the actions intended to achieve this objective.
Before us lies now the important task to ensure that the new provisions have full effect in practice.
Finally, let me again express my appreciation for your support and confidence in ensuring the rapid adoption of this important directive.
I hope it will be seen in coming years as a keystone of our efforts to ensure the safety of the European citizens.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Poverty reduction (combating the major transmissible diseases)
Mr President, a family in a mud hut in rural Africa without access to clean water, electricity, hospital or community centre is simply devastated when it discovers that a member of the family is suffering from any one of the three diseases HIV/AIDS, TB or malaria.
The patient has no access to a clinic nearby that can test, diagnose and treat him and, even if there is one, he cannot afford the treatment.
The patient's family is in crisis, not only because of illness but also because it has to find the money for treatment that will include the cost of transport and additional nutritional requirements.
This is the reality!
Therefore, my objective was to produce a report with recommendations that would support a programme of action that is possible to fund, practical to implement, and most beneficial to those who are the poor victims of such infections.
Such a report requires wide consultation with colleagues from all political groups, the European Commission, the pharmaceutical industry, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society, so that a consensus based on facts can be achieved and appropriate action taken to target the problem, making most efficient use of limited resources.
I had that wide consultation, and I want to thank all colleagues who were so helpful, in particular Dr Fransen and her team and Commissioner Nielson's department.
Dr Fransen has worked in Africa herself, so she was a mine of information.
I also want to thank all colleagues from all political parties, especially in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, related committees and, of course, the secretariats, who were extremely helpful.
The report promotes the following: a global fund financed by G8, the EU, oil-rich nations and others to finance access to and supply of medication and treatment; a global strategy to implement a programme of action to treat and prevent communicable diseases; tiered pricing of medicines from the pharmaceutical industry to ensure wide access to treatment; support for health infrastructure to scan, diagnose, treat and monitor patients, as supply of medicines in itself is inadequate; use of incentives - both financial and legislative - to enhance research and development to produce new medicines and vaccines by both industry and the public sector; the European Commission to work closely with the governments of developing countries, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society to implement the programme.
It promotes appropriate future legislation to give more flexibility in the implementation of TRIPS to encourage transfer of technology for local manufacture of essential medicines wherever this is viable.
There are four paragraphs in the report which require minor changes because of errors or difficulty in implementation.
My intention in paragraph 14 was to ensure that if we are to find the lowest prices for medicines for poor countries and for the patients in these countries, we must ensure that the developing countries do not impose import duty and taxes on imports of essential medicines.
Developed countries - the EU and the USA - do not impose export taxes when they export medicines from their countries.
So there is a mistake in paragraph 14.
I want to make an oral amendment, which I hope colleagues will accept.
It should read: "Calls on developing countries to abolish tariffs and taxes on imports of essential drugs and equipment in order to make health care more affordable;".
This paragraph really refers to import taxes in developing countries.
I also want to make an oral amendment to paragraph 9 to replace "10%" with the word "appropriate", because you cannot dictate to the European Commission and the Committee on Budgets what exact percentage of money should be spent - there are budget lines, which are already agreed in other committees and in other reports.
So "appropriate" is the word, rather than "10%".
In paragraph 20, I would like to propose an oral amendment, which I hope Members of this House will support, to delete the second part which begins "in which a doubling of the budget ....".
Again, the same problem applies: you cannot in a report like this put a fixed percentage when other committees have agreed budget lines and the Commission has budget appropriations fixed by the Council of Ministers for doing the job it is doing.
These are minor changes.
Finally, I wish to clarify the issue of the patent life of medicines, as some colleagues have expressed concern.
A new drug costs about USD 500 m to research, test and bring to market.
Unless this sum is recoverable, nobody will invest in research and the development of drugs for diseases of the poor.
No government can finance such investment so we must encourage the pharmaceutical industry to continue to finance research.
Their patent is in any case irrelevant after seven or ten years as new drugs are developed and doctors will change a treatment regime, thereby precipitating the fall in price of that medicine still under patent.
The real trick - and this is what I have been trying to do in this report - is to secure tiered pricing for all medication - new and old - so that the poor patients benefit whilst the industry continues to pay for research and development.
My Amendment No 1 addresses this problem and I have inserted the word "review" to replace the word "reduce", in order to cooperate with colleagues concerned about this issue.
So I am not throwing it out of the window, I am asking us to review it in WTO.
If there is justification for amending it, so be it.
I hope that this House will give me full support for this report, which I did not try to make political.
It concerns something that we must do for the poor so that we can tell the world, especially the poor, that the European Union is concerned about their problems and will take the lead in fighting disease and poverty throughout the world.
Mr President, five million people die each year of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries.
One of the reasons for this is that medicines are for the most part too expensive for the people of those countries.
And medicines are often unavailable altogether.
Of the more than 1 450 new medicines which have come onto the market in the last twenty years, only thirteen are intended for tropical diseases.
There is a severe lack of effective medicines in developing countries.
They are either non-existent or too expensive.
It would appear that investment in treatment of tropical diseases is not profitable enough for pharmaceutical companies.
A more tragic example of the failure of the market is hard to imagine.
These sad facts give the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy cause to propose drastic measures.
Firstly, we propose a system of differentiated pricing.
Medications should be made available free of charge or at affordable prices.
For this, it will be necessary to prevent re-importation, and the industry' s cooperation will be essential in this.
Secondly, there is the matter of patents.
Rapporteur Khanbhai mentioned the great importance of these.
Nevertheless, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proposes to shorten the period of patent protection for essential medicines in developing countries.
This is important, since in 2005 and 2006, the TRIPS Agreement is to be implemented in developing countries.
By then, there will be major problems in combating AIDS and also tuberculosis.
If the system of differentiated pricing works, this measure will not be necessary.
But should it not succeed completely, it would be an important weapon in the battle against disease in developing countries.
A third point which is also of extreme importance to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is an extensive European research programme.
This is necessary to tailor pharmaceutical research more to existing needs.
Therefore more research into, and investment in, treatment of tropical diseases, but also investment in remedies which can be used in developing countries.
Remedies which, for example, do not require refrigerated storage.
Cooperation with the developing countries is essential, and a substantial increase in the budget to go along with this.
I thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for his willingness to listen to other committees.
Mr President, the Commission' s initiative from last year to play a leading role in efforts to halt the spread of HIV, malaria and TB came not a day too soon - on the contrary.
The international community should long before have taken the HIV epidemic more seriously and generally gone to much more effort, through research and preventive measures, to reduce the spread of malaria in particular.
Lack of funds, especially in the area of research, has long been acute.
Of course, we welcome initiatives of the type which Bill Gates carried out, but this type of preventive work cannot, and must not, depend on the efforts of single individuals.
It must primarily be a task for public bodies.
The resolution under discussion today constitutes Parliament' s rather late response to the Commission' s initiative of last year.
The resolution should be seen in the context of the work we are currently carrying out with regard to the budget for next year, in which we propose, at least on a preliminary basis, considerable increases compared with the proposals of the Commission and the Council.
We believe there is a need for more capacity within the Commission in order for it to be able to play a leading role in this area.
There is also a need for more money for operational initiatives.
The situation with regard to the diseases we are discussing here today is critical.
More resources are needed, but there is also a need for new and innovative forms of partnership - especially between the public and private sectors.
We must ensure that incentives are created for increased research.
Partnership between the public and private sectors is vital, as too of course is partnership with non-governmental organisations.
I hope the Commission, and especially Mr Nielson, will see this resolution, as well as our efforts in other contexts to increase budget resources, as a strong incentive and support for the Commission with a view to the latter' s playing the leading role in the fight against HIV, malaria and TB, a fight which I believe we all feel is so important.
Ladies and gentlemen, we should indeed welcome the Khanbhai report, which is the result of some excellent work in reaching a compromise between the various political groups and the rapporteur, and I would like to thank him for his effort.
This report reflects a twofold realisation, both of the extent of the scourge and that of the financial and human resources necessary to combat it.
It enables us to take several steps forward in a debate that is essential for the very survival of part of the world.
It also clarifies Parliament' s position on many crucial points such as the need to significantly increase resources assigned to improving health systems and to fighting communicable diseases in developing countries, the will to overcome the opposition between prevention and treatment, which are two essential and complementary aspects of the fight against disease, and the emergence of a new concept of public health as a global public asset. In addition, it clarifies and provides an interpretation of the safeguard clauses in the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property.
It also confirms the fact that the issue of the price of drugs is at the heart of the debates on access to treatment and the importance of research and development and, above all, it stresses the need to focus efforts on diseases that particularly affect the South, as well as forgotten illnesses.
The European Parliament' s position is therefore now clear and coherent, but, above all, it is just and fair.
There is the feeling that we are finally beginning to ask the right questions and, from now on, we need to provide the right answers.
It is now time, ladies and gentlemen, to make the move from good intentions to positive action.
In the immediate future, there are two main areas of action in which we need to intervene.
The first involves interpreting agreements on intellectual property in a way that is more favourable to the health of the developing world.
Public opinion is ready for such progress to take place and the withdrawal of actions brought against South Africa and Brazil has created a very distinct psychological climate.
Many ambiguities still remain, however.
The fourth WTO ministerial conference in Doha should enable us to go further in officially and formally proposing guarantees on recourse to all the components of the safeguard clauses established in the TRIPS agreement, confirming in particular that in the case of compulsory licences, drugs can be produced in third countries.
The second front on which we should expect short-term progress is the global AIDS and health fund that was launched in New York and Genoa.
An interim working group has been implemented. It will make proposals in the next few days.
The principle is therefore now established.
We must insist, however, that this fund should start to operate in the coming weeks so that treatment gets to patients as soon as possible, and we must ensure that its statute and procedures are fair.
What does this mean in specific terms?
It means that the fund should be operational before 15 December, the deadline, so that the Commission can make its contribution to the 2001 budget, and so that the definitive structure of these funds and the composition of its statutory bodies respect the rule of equality between representatives from Northern and Southern States and also between the NGOs from these two areas.
It also involves, and I will end here, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, clarifications on the contribution of the European Union.
The Union committed itself in Genoa, as stated by Mr Prodi, to allocating a budget of EUR 120 million to the global health fund.
This amount is not currently entered under any budget item.
The Commission must confirm to us today that this amount will not come from and will not be deducted from other funds earmarked for development and that it is indeed an annual contribution that will be entered in the budget on the specific line from 2002.
I thank you in advance for including these particular details.
Mr President, what happened on 11 September does not reduce the need for development aid. On the contrary.
There is reason for calling upon all the EU countries to live up to their pledges in Gothenburg to increase their aid to the promised 0.7%.
The EU is most certainly the world' s largest donor region, but that does not say as much about our own efforts as about the deficiencies of others.
Even if we are not at present supposed to be criticising the United States but instead continuing to support them, it has to be said that the United States' role in this context has not been particularly distinguished, to put it mildly.
There is both their deficient contribution to the UN and the insufficient development aid they have provided.
The issue of their contribution to the UN has now been sorted out, so we can hope that the issue of development aid will also be sorted out.
Prevention is, of course, better than cure, and development aid is an effort at prevention.
It is sad that it is so easy to get expenditure on military systems authorised and that it is so difficult to get expenditure on the preventative work of development aid authorised.
We must be clear that, in our contemporary world with its TV channels, the very poorest people also know that there are very large inequalities in the world.
In reality, it is amazing that they do not react more strongly than they in fact do.
There is no doubt that the refugee ship we heard about this summer is only the first small portent of what is to come.
Following this introduction, I wish to turn to the rapporteur' s report and thank him for all the work he has put into this matter.
Crisis conditions, to put it mildly, prevail in a long list of developing countries.
A huge effort is therefore necessary when it comes to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Anyone who has been in any doubt as to whether this can simply be left to private companies can no longer, after the debate that has been conducted in recent years, be in any doubt that an effort is required, partly from the donor countries.
We cannot leave this to the free market.
It has actually been rather humiliating to discuss this matter, but that is why it is all the more gratifying that the EU has now done something in this area and, for example, totally untied the funds, which means that developing countries can buy wherever it is best and cheapest to do so.
We must not only concentrate on medicine. We must, of course, also concentrate on restructuring.
It is incredibly important that we should ensure that people are helped to help themselves and that we should see to it that systems are devised for which developing countries themselves can take responsibility and which they can, above all, manage, including when we are not there to support them.
Both medicines and infrastructure are required in this matter, and I would urge us to continue to make a major effort to help developing countries to help themselves.
Mr President, given the millions of deaths in developing countries, the European Commission' s proposal for an action programme against communicable diseases in developing countries is a strong initiative that contributes to affirming the right to health on the international stage.
If the European Union wishes to play a distinguished role in this fight and to make its action have a real impact, public health must become a priority for its cooperation in developing countries, and therefore be actually reflected in its budget.
This is why we are opposed on this point to the rapporteur' s oral amendments.
This is a shame, because we have done a great deal of preparatory work with Mr Khanbhai, in order to strengthen his initial resolution, and the votes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation enabled us to achieve a broad consensus.
At the same time, the media coverage of the actions brought by the pharmaceutical industry and the United States against South Africa and Brazil, which produce or import generic anti-AIDS drugs, lifted the veil on the economic stakes and pushed the European Union to specifically commit itself to the side of those poor populations needing access to treatment.
Although it makes sense to tackle the fight against tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS in a single programme, we do, however, need to distinguish between the specific problems posed by these three diseases.
In the case of tuberculosis, although there is a vaccine for the prevention of this disease, its effectiveness is highly disputed and there is an ever-increasing amount of resistance to treatment.
There is no vaccine for malaria and although drugs to treat the disease are inexpensive, they are decreasingly effective due to increased incidences of resistance.
There is no vaccine for AIDS nor any treatment that is accessible to the people from the South, as the pharmaceutical laboratories that own the patents keep the prices at an exorbitant level.
Moreover, we regret that diseases such as filariasis, trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness, the Ebola virus or various forms of diarrhoea are not the subject of the Commission' s communication as they are causing an ever-increasing number of deaths.
Effective and coherent action against these diseases should therefore offer different solutions depending on the case, but also combine measures on several levels.
First of all, prevention involves education and information campaigns, particularly aimed at at-risk groups, such as women and young people, conducted on the ground by influential local figures.
For the prevention of AIDS, therefore, promoting the use of condoms is a public health duty.
The best form of prevention remains the guarantee of good housing and working conditions, nutrition and health.
Development policy as a whole and all Community policies should therefore contribute to the key objective of improving public health.
In the same way, we need a more general discussion about the environment.
For example, by increasing the amount of stagnant water surfaces, damming policy has caused the number of parasite diseases to rocket.
Secondly, it is essential that we improve or even create health structures and train the staff required for the detection, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of these diseases.
The European Community development aid programme, specifically within the framework of the EDF, should be focused on health services, which have been neglected for too long due to budgetary restrictions imposed by structural adjustment.
The local health NGOs should be able to receive funds in order to carry out their day-to-day work of prevention and of supporting patients.
They should be involved in drawing up aid programmes in this field and be incorporated into public health action.
Thirdly, everyone should have access to treatment.
This means that medication should be sold at cost price to people in developing countries.
Another solution would be for these countries to have licences that authorise them to produce generic drugs.
In fact, the only way to free the people of the South from the grip of the multinational firms on price fixing for drugs in the long term is to establish a regional or local pharmaceutical industry.
The TRIP agreements should be interpreted in the same fashion, and should reaffirm the right of developing countries to use compulsory licences in the event of a health emergency.
Pharmaceutical firms need to be made to respect human rights.
In fact, following the media pressure over recent months, some of them are taking a greater interest and have promised to reduce their prices.
These measures are isolated, however, limited to a few products for a few countries and will take time.
Moreover, they are still rejecting the principle of compulsory licences.
This rejection of compulsory licences forces us to question the duration of the protection of patents.
We could also ask ourselves whether a reduction in the duration of patents is not, after all, an excellent stimulant for research.
Fourthly, we need to give new impetus to research, and this is a fundamental point.
We need to find new preventive and curative treatments that are more effective, and more importantly better adapted to local populations.
For this purpose, an international research centre on Southern diseases, financed by public and private funds, would enable us to completely free research from the purely mercenary interests of certain manufacturers.
Finally, and this is what I believe to be the most important point in this debate, is the fact that we know that the very people in the South who are dying from these diseases are urgently waiting for our help, and have been for a long time.
I think that we should broadly develop all of these structures.
All these concerns have been largely incorporated into Mr Khanbhai' s report.
This is why we call on you to vote in favour of the report, and we hope that all of these speeches will for once not go unheeded, because the people of the South need us.
Mr President, as Mr Khanbhai' s report indicates very clearly, five million people die each year basically from these three contagious diseases and ten thousand people die each day in Africa.
This seems to me to be a silent genocide that is hardly mentioned in the international press.
It seems to me that some of the proposals in the report are very good, in the sense that these deaths will not be eradicated unless basic health services are available in each one of those countries and unless, as other Members have said, there is access to the treatments, to the medicines which can put an end to these illnesses.
At present, they are not available.
Therefore, the proposal for a Commission plan and also the proposal that we contribute to an international fund to fight against these diseases seems right to us.
However, I believe that we have to look into the deeper causes.
The rapporteur rightly indicates in paragraph 13 of the resolution the fact that demanding structural changes of these countries sometimes prevents them from using sufficient public funds for the health services.
It is an infernal vicious circle, because unless there are sufficient resources for these basic health services, for improving the people' s quality of life, for them to have access to housing, food and work, it will be difficult to eradicate these diseases.
It is a vicious circle that causes a very large part of the population of the Third World countries to be in this situation.
I believe, Mr President, that prevention, better quality of life for these people, access to medicines and access to a basic health service, as the report proposes, are essential elements for a solution.
The rapporteur also points out very clearly that it is necessary to increase development aid.
It is already more than twenty years since the United Nations proposed that 0.7% of the GDP should be allocated to development.
Today, only a few Nordic countries in Europe attain that 0.7%. The majority of European countries do not reach 0.7%.
Some, like mine, do not give 0.25%.
It is deplorable, because this development aid is vital precisely for these populations to be able to access basic health services.
I would like to end, Mr President, by recalling the multiplier effect that the participation of women may have in each of these programmes.
As a member of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, I was involved in projects financed by the European Union and I could see how the participation of native women in that zone had a multiplier effect, because women can help their daughters and their fellow women to learn.
Therefore, the participation of women in these plans to eradicate these diseases is fundamental.
Mr President, it is now already a year since I took part in the round-table conference on 29 September, in which everyone agreed that no time was to be wasted in obtaining practical results in the fight against transmissible diseases. Since then, however, nothing much has happened.
The Commission has acknowledged the right of poor countries to issue compulsory licences, but what does the Commission intend to do to bring about the necessary transfer of technology so that poor countries themselves can produce medicine?
Why have we not yet seen initiatives to enable African technicians in African factories to produce medicines to combat tuberculosis, malaria and HIV?
Economically speaking, this is possible.
We are not talking in terms of huge investments to start up local production.
The necessary transfer of technology might, in addition, be envisaged in terms of allowing those employed in the medical sector in the EU to spend a couple of years in developing countries, working on such technology transfer programmes.
It is crucial to improve the skills of doctors, scientists, nurses and technicians in the poorest countries.
They must be involved in research and development, not by inviting them to European conferences - where they are likely to receive subsistence allowances - but by providing the institutions in which they work with equipment, training and communication facilities so that well-educated people living and working under incredibly difficult conditions are motivated to remain in their own countries.
Five malaria vaccines have now been developed - an extremely important step, given the fact that malaria is the disease that kills most people.
And what is the EU doing?
True, we have plans to set up a European platform to test the vaccine, even if there is already a fully developed African platform.
Does it not make sense for the vaccine to be tested by Africans in Africa, or are Africans only good enough to act as subjects of experiments by European scientists?
Let us forget all about setting up this European Clinical Trials Platform and instead support the pan-African network, AMVTN, which is just about to be converted into a fund.
It would save a huge amount of time and thus save millions of human lives, and it would save money.
It would also show that we recognise other people' s right to take charge of their own destinies, and it would provide them with the necessary transfer of technology.
It would be a fantastic first step on the way to taking action.
We have heard enough fine, but empty, words.
I should like, then, to thank Mr Khanbhai.
Mr President, despite global growth over recent decades, progress remains inadequate and unequally distributed.
Poverty, injustice and appalling conditions, from both a social and a health point of view, are still the bitter reality for many developing countries.
Thirty per cent of the world' s population live in conditions of extreme poverty, a situation exacerbated by continuous population growth and the inadequacy - or, rather, the decline - of policies for development aid, assistance and cooperation.
Europe is a relative exception, but not to the extent of correcting a worldwide downward trend.
New challenges in the developing world, such as urbanisation, environmental degradation and pollution, local warfare and the scourge of AIDS, together with the previously unthinkable resurgence of malaria and TB, threaten to drive us back.
In general, I am suspicious of statistics, which all differ, anyway, between the various Directorates-General of the Commission, as we have seen, and not uncommonly seem subservient to ideological prejudices.
There is no doubt, however, that the explosive growth of the richest countries has left the poorest countries even farther behind.
Among the indicators of poverty, that of women' s poverty stands out: the majority of poor people, the poorest of the poor, are women, just as most illiterate people are women and women continue to work more and to earn and count for less.
It would be difficult to deny or underestimate the importance of the link that still persists between poverty, disease, illiteracy and population growth, a link which has its most obvious proof in the scale of women' s poverty, the suffering of women and gender inequalities.
On the other hand, the reports of both the Commission and Parliament seem to me to be evasive, not to say reticent, on the subject of population.
The reports concentrate on the fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, going at length into sophisticated technical analyses and proposals for reforms, which may serve to improve our measures for combating poverty - especially on the question of drugs and health services - but do not propose any measures to improve the effectiveness of policies on population control, healthy and sustainable fertility, or free and informed maternity, as if this subject had disappeared from our view.
Yet this is still the crucial issue.
Let us consider the facts: in purely numerical terms, never have so many people been torn by poverty as this year.
Yet, because of the continuing population growth, today there are more poor people in the world than all those that have ever lived throughout history.
Since the end of the last century, the world population has grown fourfold, from one and a half billion to six billion.
The greatest growth has been in Asia: India, China, Indochina and, in particular, Indonesia.
The population trend in the rich countries is, conversely, now stationary, but the balance achieved depends on a longer life expectancy, which makes up for the slump in the birth rate.
Africa, in turn, has seen a population explosion, mainly due to the fall in infant mortality.
This trend seems today to be more contained, not because population policies have been successful but because of epidemics, especially, as has been said, of AIDS, TB and malaria.
Africa challenges us and moves us, but Africa is not the whole world and is itself diverse in its various parts. It certainly has more need than any other region of a population policy more concerned with the condition of women.
Throughout the rest of the world, not only in the rich countries, population growth has slowed down somewhat over recent decades, but if you look more closely you will see both that the birth rate has fallen and that life expectancy has increased, and that means a population that is continuing to grow and which, in most situations, is ageing, as well as cases of overpopulation in certain regional and local areas.
In conclusion, if we want to be more effective in fighting poverty, we cannot avoid or ignore the matter of population control. It is true that it is linked to economic and cultural growth, but we are not without suitable tools and appropriate experience in the field of prevention and contraception.
History teaches us that there has never been so much growth and so much poverty. Experience shows that it is no use trying to dry out a flooded room without turning off the taps.
Mr President, Mr Khanbhai has produced a balanced report, whose proposals we gladly lend our support to.
The report draws specific attention to the triangle of poverty, health and education, no part of which can be ignored without action in the other two areas coming to nothing.
Poverty has sometimes been compared to war: it takes prisoners and it kills.
The only difference is that death from poverty is slow and the victim him/herself is branded as the culprit.
I therefore also want to remind our Member States of the 0.7% target, to give some credibility to our calls for altruism in the pharmaceutical industry.
I would particularly support the establishment of a global infectious disease fund and the introduction of compulsory licences to improve the availability of medicines.
Both will take great initiative on the part of the EU and their successful implementation will require the goodwill of key global movers and shakers as well as institutions.
In any action taken, however, it has to be borne in mind that, without viable basic health care, no other developments are possible.
Good basic health in itself also prevents more dangerous infections, and it makes it easier to identify infections early on and stop them if basic health care has been provided for.
We must not forget the importance of people' s attitudes: if there is not even any functional basic health care in place, apathy grows and then people cannot in all fairness be asked to take seriously infection risks that might develop into fatal illnesses in the years to come.
No matter how fearful the prospects of communicable disease are, making us feel a spontaneous need to take specific action as a consequence, it should never be done at the expense of basic health care.
It can, therefore, be said with some justification that EU aid with regard to basic health care has been totally inadequate for a long time now.
For that reason, doubling the EU' s financial aid resources for basic health care can be considered to be the most essential matter from the point of view of all the other objectives.
We should bear in mind the Copenhagen Social Summit pledge to attain universal and equitable access to primary health care.
Mr President, I should like to begin by commending both the Commission communication and Mr Khanbhai's report.
Access to medicines will be a key issue at Doha in a few weeks' time simply because developing countries feel hugely disadvantaged by rules which are applied universally, even though countries are of unequal strength, both economically and institutionally.
They will be calling clearly for the TRIPS Agreement to be applied fairly.
The global spotlight, therefore, will be firmly on the role played by pharmaceutical companies in the HIV/AIDS catastrophe.
Only 0.1% of the 25 million people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa have access to lifesaving drugs or indeed for the drugs for the opportunistic infections such as meningitis, drug-resistant diarrhoea, oral thrush and those other infections.
There are now alternatives - cheap copies of life-saving medicines.
In Brazil, Thailand and India their laws allow them to ignore drug patents.
In India for instance, companies are marketing a drug for the treatment of that drug-resistant diarrhoea, at 1.8% of the price charged in Pakistan where only the patented version can be bought.
Four years ago Brazil waived the patent rights on HIV drugs and allowed local companies to produce cheap versions.
Prices in Brazil have fallen by 80% and they have halved the number of deaths from HIV/AIDS.
I come to the point made by Mr Khanbhai on research and development.
If so much commitment is made by the pharmaceutical companies to R&D, how come they actually spend twice as much on marketing as they do on research and development?
According to the UNDP's recent figures less than 10% of global spending on health research addresses 90% of the global disease burden.
Of the 1223 new drugs marketed between 1975 and 1996, only 13 of those drugs were developed to treat tropical diseases and only 4 of those 13 were the result of the pharmaceutical industry's research.
And why is it that they charge more for the same drugs in Africa, than they charge in the northern hemisphere?
I would argue that these facts very clearly speak for themselves.
They have - and this is a very important point to make and it will be made in Doha - a virtual monopoly which means that they can control prices.
They are virtually saying "no" to cheap, affordable generics for very sick people in poor countries.
Globalisation is meant to be about freer markets and about increased competition.
The big four pharmaceutical companies act like a cartel: they bully developing countries and they deny them their rights to those drugs.
During the Uruguay Round they secured agreement on patent rights for 20 years.
The TRIPS Agreement was a clear example of the powerful vested interests of the developed world at this time.
All this threatens the whole credibility of the World Trade Organisation and any chance we have of believing in the developments at Doha, or if we ever have a new round of fair, multilateral trading systems.
There is now a clear need for a clear and new interpretation of TRIPS allowing for the flexibility which clearly exists in that agreement.
We need to ensure that it is the interests of poor countries that are put first.
This is an issue of fundamental social justice.
Mr President, it is unacceptable that millions of people continue to die unnecessarily from AIDS, malaria and TB.
We have here a global problem of the highest order.
Our own citizens who are HIV positive are able to access long-term treatment with effective medication.
For patients in developing countries, the medicines are too expensive and the medical infrastructure to provide care for them is lacking.
Also, if a patient is not disciplined in taking his medicines regularly and in the correct dosage, they lose their effect.
The pharmaceutical industry only lowered its prices under the heavy pressure of global public opinion, and those prices are still far too high.
A further lowering of prices must be realised through industrial and government cooperation.
Only a very broadly established, very expensive and dogged international campaign can effectively tackle this large-scale problem.
Mr Khanbhai' s excellent report provides a clear overview of all the important aspects of the transmittable disease.
We join him in welcoming the European Union' s campaign programme.
It is well thought out and deserves to be carried out with the greatest urgency.
May I ask the Commissioner whether he has sufficient personnel resources available for this?
I advocate a very substantial provision in the budget over the coming years for the AIDS fund, without detriment to present provision for poverty relief.
Does the Commissioner consider this feasible and can he also tell us the situation regarding the setting up of the fund?
It is also a requirement that the twenty-year patent protection term specified in the TRIPS Agreement be considerably reduced for essential medicines.
The pharmaceutical industry must, of course, be able to continue investing in research into vaccines and cheap medicines, but must gain its profits in the rich countries and not in the epidemic-ridden Third World.
Results will not be achieved without large-scale information campaigns.
Sexual behaviour and attitudes towards women, in particular, will have to change dramatically.
Women' s right of self-determination is fundamentally at issue here.
A great responsibility also rests with the developing countries themselves, not only with the governments and the NGOs, but especially with the religious leaders who can wield moral authority.
If they refuse to cooperate, they will be partly responsible for the misery.
Only a collective effort can end the situation whereby millions of our fellow humans die, countless children are orphaned and economies are ruined needlessly.
Members of the Lutte OuvriÃšre party will vote in favour of this report, despite its shortcomings, due to the realistic account it gives of the catastrophic situation in poor countries and the few limited, yet positive, measures that it proposes.
It is appalling when we take account of the fact that three communicable diseases are killing five million people per year in poor countries and ten thousand people per day in Africa alone and that, moreover, the number of victims is increasing.
This is very true in the case of AIDS, where there is no known cure, whereas there are cures available for tuberculosis and malaria.
Despite this, malaria, which a few years ago appeared to be on course for total eradication has, as the report highlights, become the main cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, whilst tuberculosis, for which there are simple and effective treatments, continues to be the disease most widespread throughout the world.
The cause of this situation is simple.
Drug manufacturing is monopolised by large pharmaceutical corporations, whose prime concern is not public health, but profit.
The recent ignominious action brought by certain pharmaceutical corporations against South Africa is characteristic of this intolerable situation, even though public opinion did, to a certain extent, cause these corporations to back off.
The report' s proposal that aims for the European Union to recognise on the international level the right of developing countries to produce and sell generic drugs within their countries, without costs resulting from intellectual property rights, is the least we can do.
Another example of this would be to impose specifications on the pharmaceutical corporations obliging them to produce drugs for these diseases, which the report says are neglected by the industry because they are not profitable enough.
The report limits itself to mentioning a reduction in prices.
Millions of people in poor countries will only be able to have access to minimum treatment if certain drugs, particularly malaria drugs, are free of charge.
The report tries to reconcile the protection of patents with access to healthcare in developing countries; we reaffirm that industrial patents, and more specifically those patents involving the pharmaceutical industry, should be completely abolished.
They do nothing to protect the intellectual property of the inventor, they only serve to guarantee the corporations a monopoly position and therefore the enormous profits that they earn to the detriment of public health and life itself.
The heading of the report says that the fight against infectious diseases contributes to poverty reduction.
In fact, most of these diseases are diseases related to poverty, even to malnutrition.
Only an improvement in people' s standard of living would be effective in eradicating most of them.
Having said this, however, for the benefit of the advocates of the market economy and capitalism, the simple fact that it is organically incapable of providing the most basic treatment and daily food for a considerable proportion of humanity in the twenty-first century, even though it has scientific and material possibilities like never before, irreparably condemns it.
President, in many European countries, at any rate in the Netherlands, there have been drastic changes in healthcare in recent years.
More differentiation, more individual care, increased personal choice and especially improved efficiency have been the most important aims.
Often these changes give rise to criticism, especially where the general availability of healthcare is concerned.
To many of us, it is unacceptable on principle that a higher place on the waiting list should be for sale.
This would mean that a person' s health would be governed by his income.
And we do not want that.
It is all the more remarkable that the above situation is simply the harsh reality throughout the world.
Indeed, the Commission proposals under discussion today demonstrate that the availability of adequate medicines to the poorest, despite repeated promises, still leaves much to be desired.
There is much less indignation in the West concerning this.
In a world of increasing globalisation, however, we cannot shirk our international responsibility.
Our own healthcare problems are dwarfed by those of the majority of the world' s population.
I therefore support the measures proposed.
We will have to operate on two levels to combat these diseases.
In the first place, by participating on a micro level in healthcare improvement projects.
As far as I am concerned, these projects could be funded and executed via bilateral channels.
The European Union could play an important role with larger infra-structural projects which involve NGOs from several Member States.
In the second place, by creating on a macro level the necessary conditions to facilitate those projects on a micro level.
Policy direction is an important instrument here.
I particularly welcome, therefore, the paragraphs on the TRIPS and the WTO in the European Parliament' s resolution. Especially since they provide the European Union with an important task.
I only need to see a concrete reference to the forthcoming meetings in Qatar.
I hope that the Commissioner responsible will nevertheless carry out our recommendations at that conference.
Mr President, in the North people think it is all over where AIDS is concerned.
It is not, of course, but changing lifestyles and the arrival of effective drug regimes have, at least, helped us turn a corner on the long road that we walk.
The forecasts when I was health minister fighting these issues were not the same as the forecasts now.
But in the South the picture is very different.
Ninety-five per cent of the five million new cases every year are in low-income countries in the South.
There are 25 million people living with AIDS in Africa and 6 million in the new-growth area in Asia - South and Southeast Asia in particular.
Where AIDS is concerned we face a vicious cycle of infection, incapacity and poverty alongside the 16 million deaths we have already seen: two million deaths a year in Africa, a quarter of all Africa's deaths.
Ten per cent of people between fifteen and fifty years of age are living with AIDS, and there are 10 million orphans.
The people who expected to be looked after in their old age are now unable to have that care and support because their children are dead.
That is the scene confronting us.
When The Economist went to Zambia and looked at a particular hospital, it saw two-thirds of the patients there dying of AIDS.
People's limbs, they reported, looked like broken broomsticks.
When they were asked what they were desperate for, they did not say retroviral drugs, they said food, because they were too poor to be able to afford either.
Poverty hastens death, and deaths accelerate the survivors' descent into poverty.
In Zambia the department of health then estimated that half the population would die of AIDS.
That is a human disaster.
We are facing human disasters in America now.
The world is looking at the headlines, the world is taking action, governments are coming together, people are demanding and subscribing to solutions.
But they are not doing that where AIDS, TB and malaria are concerned.
It is not terrorism, but it is a health terror and horror that is preventable.
That is why the honourable Member's report is so important and fundamental.
I congratulate him and the Commission on the work that has been done on this matter and everyone who has participated.
Poverty reduction goes hand in hand with the war against disease, disability and death.
We desperately need more resources for drugs and vaccines, but must also ensure their adequate distribution to people, so that drugs do not sit in storage deteriorating.
We must have adequate education, monitoring and research.
It has rightly been said that research should be conducted in Africa, by Africans, for Africans and, where appropriate, with the support, cooperation and partnership of the Western world, along the lines of the IAVI initiative between Oxford and Nairobi.
TB too, of course, is a killer.
It accounts for two million deaths a year, 95% of them in developing countries; it is the leading cause of HIV deaths; one infected person can pass it on to ten others.
Malaria is the third killer; 90% of deaths from Malaria occur in Africa - one death every 30 seconds.
In the past four minutes, eight people have died from malaria.
I want us and the Commissioner to keep those people who are dying of these diseases in mind and see what we can do.
The honourable Member has provided the words in this report; now it is time for the Commission to act.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the common feature of all the statements made in this debate so far is the belief that investment in healthcare is extremely worthwhile and is an important way of achieving sustainable development and combating poverty, which are two objectives of European development policy.
It is a proven fact that countries with a high standard of health and generous investment in this area achieve higher levels of development, including economic development.
Some of us have already observed that we must persuade the governments in these countries to spend more on this area of healthcare and education, and I naturally underline this political demand as well.
Yet it would be cynical in the extreme if we failed to point out that the structural adjustment programmes which must be undertaken by these countries to secure loans and funding from the international financial institutions now require them to spend less on prevention, public health and education.
One point which is very important, in my view, is the involvement of women in devising birth control programmes and other reproductive health campaigns.
Women - and I am not saying anything new - are extremely vulnerable to poverty.
Furthermore, as the HIV/AIDS infection rates in southern Africa show, women are also affected by this disease to a far greater extent than men.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about one of the most pressing issues addressed in the Khanbhai report, namely the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).
I believe that in future, too, the European Union must assist the developing countries to benefit from the opportunities already afforded by the TRIPS agreement.
Naturally, this is set forth in the provisions of the TRIPS agreement, but has not always been accepted by the pharmaceutical industry, as the case of South Africa shows.
In my view, the proposal outlined in paragraph 41 of the Khanbhai report on reducing the period of patent protection is essential.
I believe that when we talk about poverty, we must also identify tangible measures for the reform of the WTO.
Otherwise, we will also lose credibility.
As many of the previous speakers have pointed out, it is high time we took practical steps in this direction.
Mr President, in 1979, Willy Brandt presented his famous "North-South Report, a programme for survival", in which he warned of the risk that in the year 2000 a large part of the population would continue to live in poverty.
Shortly after that pronouncement some frightening statistics were published; every 24 hours, 35 000 human beings died of hunger in the world.
In two years, hunger caused more deaths than the two world wars put together.
The year 2000 arrived and the situation has only got worse.
According to the World Health Organisation, extreme poverty - misery - is the chief cause of suffering in the world and is also the one which each year claims the greatest number of human lives and yet we are still talking about poverty and how we are going to remedy it.
A few months ago, before the summer, at our Brussels headquarters, the United Nations together with the EU organised the Third Conference on the Least-developed Countries dedicated in particular to analysing the causes, consequences and solutions of poverty.
We also set an ambitious target: to reduce poverty by half by the year 2005.
Some studies lead to the conclusion, Mr President, that by what we are doing, with the plans and projects we intend to carry out and above all, with the resources we allocate and those which are intended to be allocated, that objective cannot be met.
Our concern now is to combat the international terrorism fostered by some notorious fanatics.
True, that is the problem of the moment but, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the root of the problem.
The problem is poverty throughout a large part of the world.
Until we solve the problem of poverty, especially the extreme poverty - misery - in which hundreds of millions, around 1 500 million human beings, and I am using cautious figures, live, we will continue to be exposed to situations such as those we are experiencing now.
Between 13 and 19 September some of us were visiting some of the poorest regions of the planet, in the south of the African continent.
Mozambique today has 19 million inhabitants but within 9 years only 13 million will still be alive; the remaining 6 will have died of Aids.
Today Mr Khanbhai in his report proposes a series of measures to combat Aids, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of reducing poverty.
During a visit to a field hospital way out in the middle of the African savannah, my colleagues and I witnessed how victims of a cholera epidemic are dying - believe me, right now - in a Dante-esque spectacle such as occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages.
This is also happening at other hospitals which are not in the middle of nowhere.
In Mocuba, there is a provincial hospital where women give birth next to patients with Aids, tuberculosis, leprosy, meningitis, and infectious diarrhoeas of all kinds.
For all these diseases which today can be cured and eradicated, there are drugs.
It is a problem of resources, and above all, it is a problem of political will.
Mr Khanbhai, I congratulate you and thank you for the important contribution you have made in your report.
But, Mr Bashir, you know your native Africa better than I do.
Let us make no mistake, the problems of poverty in the world are today of such magnitude that these measures, with the present resources, are like a drop in the ocean.
Some day we will realise this.
Either we fight against poverty with all our energy and all our resources until we conquer it, or poverty with its many faces - now taking the form of terrorism - will conquer us.
Mr President, others have established the need for action.
I should just like to add one fact: in the UK and Europe drugs cocktails have decreased AIDS deaths by 75%, in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of all people infected with HIV live, only one person in a thousand receives drug treatment.
Education is crucial to prevent people being infected with HIV in the first place, but access to drugs really does make a difference.
The drug companies are our partners.
But it is crucial that they act with integrity.
I will never forget the representative for SmithKline Beecham sitting in our EU/ACP Joint Assembly in Brussels, banging the table and saying that they had lowered the prices of essential medicines.
And then later in the year Mr Nielson was told they were going to lower them all over again.
Which is the lowest price - the one they told us in the spring, or the one they told us in the autumn?
I went to Gabon and South Africa and met doctors who are desperate to use those drugs, who have read the Internet press releases saying that the prices have been brought down; yet when they ring up they cannot actually acquire the drugs to treat those patients.
I have asked SmithKline Beecham what is the genuine, long-term cost of production of these drugs.
They will not say.
I have asked them how long they will commit themselves to these lower prices.
They will not commit themselves.
I have asked them why, if they are seeking a partnership with developing country governments, they face legal action, not just in South Africa but in India, Brazil and elsewhere.
They just will not answer.
We send a clear message to the drugs companies in this resolution: prices are too high and legislative action, including compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency, is needed to deal with it.
Finally, to Mr Khanbhai, it is no good claiming that you are seeking consensus, including NGOs for example, and then putting forward your Amendment No 1, opposing a reduction in patent protection.
Name one NGO which supports that position.
I will always remember that SmithKline Beecham's key anti-retroviral drug was not brought onto the market because of privately-funded research.
It was publicly-funded research.
They used a dormant patent to acquire that protection for their own commercial gain.
Let us have some clear speaking in this debate.
(Applause from the left)
Mr President, 7000 people died in the wake of terrorist atrocities in New York and Washington and the global response was one of shock and horror, followed by a flurry of diplomatic activity and detailed planning for an adequate response.
In Africa, 10 000 people die every day from AIDS, malaria or tuberculosis.
Why is there not a similar response?
Regrettably, the harsh truth is that the developed world does not place the same value on human life in Africa.
It is a terrible indictment on all of us who live in the world's richest countries that this scale of human tragedy continues to occur into the 21st century.
Several years ago malaria seemed close to being eliminated, today it is the most common cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa.
Tuberculosis is the most prevalent disease in the world, and 35 million people are infected with AIDS, with half of all new HIV infections occurring in the 15-24 year-old age group.
I acknowledge that the EU Commission contributed EUR 4.2 billion for health assistance during the 1990s.
However, as the rapporteur pointed out, although EUR 700 million were allocated for health in 1998, the amount for 1996-1998 was only 4% of the total EU development budget.
This indicates how low down it has been on the list of our political priorities.
I hope this will now change with the publication of the new policy framework by the Commission and its proposed programme of action for the years 2001-2006.
Its three-prong strategy of better deployment of existing resources, increasing the affordability to people in poorer countries of key drugs, and support for more research is indeed welcome.
However, the proposals need to be developed further and underpinned by a greater financial commitment, indicative of a greater political priority.
The best means of achieving this is by taking on board the excellent proposals put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai.
His call for the EU to devote 10% of our development aid to tackling this problem, his emphasis on preventative action with the 15-24 year-old age group in relation to AIDS, and his proposal for a global fund for infectious diseases and the establishment of an EU research agency should be the cornerstone of any new EU policy in this area.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, HIV and AIDS are not only a health policy problem, but a general social problem. This has been made quite clear during today's debate.
A holistic strategy is therefore required to combat them.
Tackling poverty is one approach, but I would like to focus on other priorities which I believe are equally important: information and education, prevention, and of course treatment.
These are the three areas which must be considered if we want to make progress, particularly in Africa, where the problem is most acute.
This means providing information and sex education for children and young people, for without a change in sexual behaviour, the problem cannot be mastered.
A proportion of the available resources must therefore be allocated for this purpose too.
The sexually active population must have the opportunity to practise prevention.
I should particularly like to mention Senegal as a positive example, where religious and political leaders have worked together to halt the spread of AIDS through prevention.
A similar approach has also been adopted in Uganda.
If politicians and a country's spiritual leaders work together on this issue, a great deal can be achieved.
The CÃŽte d'Ivoire, for example, has therefore appointed a Minister for AIDS and HIV.
I believe that these are models which deserve our support.
There is another important problem, which is how to prevent the sick from being ostracized.
This is a major problem.
We must dismantle social taboos and not only ensure that those who are living with infection receive the medication they need, but also encourage their positive integration into society.
This is the only way to create a climate which ultimately halts the spread of disease in a holistic way.
Mr President, allow me first of all to express my appreciation for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai.
In the eight months since the Commission adopted an ambitious programme for action targeting the major communicable diseases, a number of events have reconfirmed the need for action, for the global mobilisation of efforts and financing, and for the political will to achieve our aims.
Health is fully on our agenda now, and the same is true of our own Member States.
Health in developing countries is, together with education, one of the six priorities for the Commission for 2002.
Investing in health is a key strategy for economic development and poverty reduction, and hence a crucial component of a sound development strategy.
I wish to highlight and express my strong agreement with the remarks made by Mrs Korhola and Mr Bowis on the need to organise basic health care in a manner that actually works.
In this regard we should bear in mind that annual per capita spending on public health services in sub-Saharan Africa is between USD 2 and USD 6.
This is the economic framework before us.
Reconciling the low capacity of health systems with, in particular, care and work on administering anti-retroviral drugs to AIDS and HIV-positive patients is an extremely difficult task.
I should like to mention one case that illustrates this.
In Botswana USD 100 million has been mobilised jointly by Merck, one of the big pharmaceutical companies, and the Bill Gates Foundation.
They are doing everything they can to organise their work on the ground and use these advanced types of medicine in ongoing treatment.
Their experience is that very little has been possible.
The absence of infrastructure in this area, of educated nurses and of the conditions required for these types of advanced medicine, which are very difficult to administer, to work, shows that even concentrated, well-funded efforts spanning one-and-a-half years in a place that is better organised than most others in Africa has not done the trick.
This is also why the pharmaceutical companies are warning against highlighting too uncritically the use of anti-retroviral drugs as the solution.
That warning has to be taken seriously.
Our programme for action has been moving forward.
We are speeding up the actual disbursement rate in the field of health.
I would not go as far as to express satisfaction at this, but the situation is improving.
We are disbanding dormant projects and improving projects that need to be improved.
All this work is taking place.
Now a few remarks on financial allocations.
Firstly, I appreciate the remarks made today by Mr Khanbhai concerning the mechanics of how we allocate this money.
We would like to get away from input-related targets.
They are advantageous in being easier to communicate regularly; however, we are seeking to focus on output and processes rather than on input.
An important aspect of this debate is the fact that the budget does not reveal directly how much we are actually doing in areas such as health and education.
It must be borne in mind that macroeconomic support, our budget support, is in fact linked to health and education.
That link provides the answer as to how much - or how little - we are doing.
At present it is extremely difficult to quantify this specifically but we are working on this.
Mr Khanbhai also referred to a change relating to the import of drugs and the need to abolish tariffs in this regard.
This is definitely something that must be done.
It should be borne in mind that liberalisation on a regional basis, which we are urging our partners to move forward on, is also an answer to this problem.
Furthermore it can solve the problem of creating a better basis for starting up medicine production in developing countries.
If you cannot access a neighbouring market from a given African country investing there in order to do something in this area is not a good idea.
The question of access to medicines, an issue brought up by many, is currently being discussed at the TRIPS Council in Geneva.
The discussions have sought to strike a balance between the need to pursue access to affordable medicines and the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement.
A declaration for the ministerial meeting in Doha is now being prepared.
May I state most clearly that the EC has no intention of applying pressure on or criticising developing countries that invoke their rights under the TRIPS Agreement.
It is in the interest of all WTO members that the TRIPS provisions be clear, so as to provide for lawful and correct implementation of the agreement.
As to paragraph 41 on Mr Khanbhai's report, the current review process within the TRIPS Council of certain provisions does not include the patent periods, nor the so-called "ever-greening" of patents mentioned in the report.
It is not the opinion of the Commission that the patent period needs to be amended.
On the second issue, "ever-greening", there are no provisions in the TRIPS Agreement that could be applied here.
The substance and level of invention for the granting of a patent is evaluated by national patent authorities.
Allow me to make a few remarks on the other paragraphs.
Ninety-five percent of drugs listed as essential drugs by WHO are off patents and may be produced freely.
The remaining 5% are drugs patented in most countries.
It is the Commission's view that compulsory licenses should be issued in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement.
Tiered pricing, in the sense that pharmaceutical companies voluntarily offer their products at heavily discounted prices to developing poor markets, is something the Commission strongly supports.
It was one of the sticking points in the discussion of the guidelines for the health fund.
We are working towards a global system of tiered pricing that will supply markets on a sustainable basis.
Supplying poor markets at the lowest possible prices should be the rule. This should comprise all essential and key medicines.
Of course, if large quantities of tiered price products are exported to developing countries, the risk of trade diversion becomes high.
Therefore we are considering stronger measures to prevent the re-importation of tiered-price products into the Community.
In paragraph 38 the report calls for the establishment of a fund for infectious diseases.
You will all be aware that this Global AIDS and Health Fund was launched by the UN Secretary-General at the special session on HIV/Aids in June.
On behalf of the Commission President Prodi pledged EUR 120 million to the fund.
Total contributions have now reached USD 1.8 billion.
We are actively involved in working out the operational modalities for the fund, its governance, legal basis and its focus.
I agree with what a few of the speakers said concerning the situation of women.
The whole agenda concerning reproductive and sexual health and rights needs to be kept in mind whenever we discuss these issues.
Mrs SandbÃŠk mentioned the issue of testing.
I want to clarify that we are working on testing in Africa ...
(The President called for order to allow the speaker to be heard )
I feel confident that those Members who really want to hear what I have to say are definitely trying to do so.
I thank them from the bottom of my heart.
Concerning the activity of the Commission in the area of research, the reality is that we are proving quite successful in the attempt to organise a big Africa-focused network and to carry out testing as part of the whole research and development process.
This is progressing quite well.
The subject of the Global AIDS and Health Fund was touched upon by many speakers.
I want to give some additional information here.
We are involved in discussions on the modalities of the fund and there are still a few differences that need to be resolved.
They concern the balance between prevention and care, especially in relation to HIV/AIDS.
They concern the question to what extent the fund should supply anti-retrovirals, whether the fund should also cover research activities, the structure of tendering in the fund, and its focus in terms of geography.
Many issues are therefore, being discussed now.
As a background to this discussion we also note that there is a section within the NGO community that sees the fund as a distraction from longer-term development processes, in particular support for strengthening the health systems.
In my view, these words of warning have to be taken seriously.
There are still many questions to resolve before it becomes clear what real added value the fund will create, especially in the most important area of improving delivery on the ground, which is still the biggest challenge.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbai.
We look forward to working - as we have done until now - hand-in-hand with Parliament and keeping up the pressure to move this agenda forward.
Mr President, on a point of order, when the Commissioner quotes the WHO Essential Medicines' List he knows that includes not just essential medicines, but the affordability of those medicines.
Therefore, the very medicines we are discussing are excluded from the list in question.
Mr Howitt, you can communicate it in writing, thank you.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at noon.
Madam President, I believe you have been told about the discussion which took place in the House this morning at the opening of the sitting.
It is not my intention to reopen the discussion, because I am sure that Vice-President Imbeni will have mentioned the matter to you.
We are looking forward to your answer, after voting time, if you prefer, because I imagine all the Members wish to vote.
Mrs Napoletano, I was indeed told about your speech at the beginning of the plenary sitting this morning.
However, you referred to a letter that Mr Tajani had sent to me.
I have not yet been able to read the translation of his letter, which I received towards the end of the morning, as the letter had to be translated and that was difficult to do overnight.
Of course, I will only be able to take a position when I have had the opportunity to read the letter that Mr Tajani sent to me.
I therefore give him the same answer: I am sorry.
It deals with a very delicate problem, that of the possible limitations on the freedom of expression of heads of State, Commissioners and Members of Parliament, which is a very serious problem.
Be assured that I am going to give it all the attention that the problem deserves.

Wurtz (GUE/NGL).
(FR) Madam President, I would like to know if it is possible for each group to very briefly explain how it voted on this draft regulation.
I am sure you will understand.
This is an agreement that has been reached between all the groups.
Madam President, I would simply like to say that, of course, it goes without saying that my group is, completely and unequivocally, firmly opposed to terrorism and, therefore, in agreement with the principle of the Commission' s proposal of depriving these terrorist organisations of their funds.
However, my group finds the method imposed on us unacceptable, in other words, having to decide urgently on a list that was sent to us by the United States without explanation...
... and which could be changed outside our control.
This is why we cannot, unfortunately, approve this draft regulation as it is today.

Before the vote on recital H
Madam President, I request that the rapporteur and all the Members accept the following oral amendment with a view to replacing the original text of recital H with the following:
Whereas an urgent review of the "Television without frontiers" Directive is necessary.
It is more precise, more accurate and has the same meaning.

Before the start of the vote
Madam President, there is a mistake in the Spanish text, paragraph 6, with reference to the word 'parents', which should come before primary and secondary schoolteachers.
I hope that translation will be corrected in the Spanish text.
Although there is widespread support for some other oral amendments which I was going to make, I understand there is opposition from the Greens so the only oral amendment that I wish to make now concerns paragraph 14.
There is a genuine error and it should be amended to read, 'Calls on all developing countries to abolish tariffs and taxes on import of essential drugs and equipment in order to make healthcare more affordable.'
There is no tax when we export medicines from Europe or the United States, so the current paragraph is factually incorrect.
I hope Members will support this.

Mr President, I was somewhat surprised that, prior to voting on the Council' s Regulation on the combating of international terrorism and the freezing of funds of terrorist organisations, we did not allow all the parties one minute' s speaking time to outline their standpoint.
Indeed, it was agreed earlier with all the political parties that we would discuss this prior to voting in view of the urgency with which the material was presented and since we had no time for a debate.
It is a very important matter.
I therefore regret that we did not get that opportunity.
For the rest, I will submit the substance of our contribution in writing.
But what concerns us is that we think it very important, where this proposal is concerned, that a judicial review should take place.
We are delighted with this proposal from the Committee.
We are pleased that it is based on Article 308 of the Treaty.
This means that there is a role for the Court of Justice and this means that there is a role for the European Parliament.
We are very disappointed in the Council' s rejection yesterday of this legal basis.
The Council has not understood the urgency of this proposal and has also failed to understand the need to base it on Article 308.
By wishing to base it on various articles of the Third Pillar, the Council of course wants to exclude both the Court of Justice and the European Parliament.
It is a serious matter that should most certainly have been discussed in Parliament.
Mrs Buitenweg, I would like to answer you with regard to the way votes are conducted in this House.
I did of course scrupulously apply the Rules of Procedure.
I have to say that I was expecting every group to ask me for this minute of speaking time.
It was not my job to grant it by virtue of an agreement made in the corridors.
In fact, what should have happened and what I was expecting was for a number of Members, 32 to be precise, in order to comply with the Rules of Procedure, to request a debate, which in any case was not possible because we had voted on the topical and urgent debate and at that point the groups asked me for a minute each.
Mr Wurtz was the only one to make this request.
I was the most surprised of all, Mrs Buitenweg.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
To those colleagues who are asking for the floor for an oral explanation of vote on the procedures without report, I remind you that oral explanations of vote cannot be made for procedures without report.
I am sorry, that is the rule.
Does that come from the Rules of Procedure, Madam President?
Yes, it is in Rule 137:
"When a Commission proposal or report is on the agenda of Parliament pursuant to Rules 62, paragraph 5, or 114, Members may submit written explanations of vote pursuant to Rule 1."
International terrorism (C5-0455/2001)
President, I have supported the request for specific measures against terrorism in particular because the right of judicial challenge to the European Court of Justice is enshrined in the legal base.
This has been clarified by the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Green Group in order to protect human rights.
Civil liberties, the infringement of which some are fearful of, should be protected as all procedures are subject to challenge at the European Court of Justice.
We cannot be neutral against terror.
Europe should support the US in finding and suppressing the terrorists but we should also have a long-term plan to deal with conflict resolution and to put in infrastructural support in places like Afghanistan where humanitarian aid is needed but is only a stopgap to a fully functioning society.
For years the European Parliament has called for the support of the civilian population in Afghanistan which has been the subject of terrorism from the Taliban.
Women in particular have suffered.
There have been increasing numbers of attacks on women throughout the region and in Kashmir by Islamic extremists who have thrown acid in their faces injuring them horribly in order to make them wear the burka, a full face covering.
While reaffirming our complete opposition both to terrorist methods and to the reactionary objectives pursued by those responsible for these acts, we refuse to associate ourselves will all of the proposals from the Council of the European Union.
The political leaders of the big imperial powers, both American and European, are trying to channel the legitimate emotions caused by the attacks in New York to serve a policy aimed solely at ensuring their domination over the world, and not at preserving the interests and the safety of the people.
We reject any initiative, even a partial one, aimed towards military operations, which would inevitably make victims of the people, who have nothing to do with terrorism.
Individual terrorism does not justify State terrorism or make it acceptable.
We protest against the measures restricting individual freedoms that this climate of war is bringing about.
As for the fight against the funding of terrorist groups, if the governments really want to conduct it they should immediately abolish banking secrecy and business secrecy.
The prevarications and measures in this area which are as limited as they are ineffective only prove that we prefer to put up with terrorist money and money from organised crime than to ensure total transparency, which could unveil multiple trafficking and ignominies in the capitalist system itself and the considerable wastage that it costs society.
First of all, I must admit that this explanation of vote is difficult.
Like everybody else we are appalled by the attacks that took place on 11 September.
It is frustrating to decide not to use additional means to fight those who committed them.
We are, however, convinced that it is a choice governed by reason, and not by an instinctive reaction, which is legitimate but dangerous, motivated by anger and pain.
Apart from the fact that we refuse to set a precedent on urgent procedures, which could then dramatically increase, we have questions regarding the list proposed in the annex, which reveals genuine and fundamental problems.
Of course, we are in total agreement with the principle of implementing specific measures against people and goods linked to terrorism, in order to fight it more effectively.
There are too many areas of doubt in this well-known list:
How can we support it when we do not even know how it was put together?
On what criteria were these people selected?
We know that there is no definition of terrorism in international law, and that it is therefore impossible to set out objective criteria for what constitutes belonging to a terrorist movement.
All that is needed is to observe how easily some people call any behaviour that goes against prevailing thought 'terrorism' , such as is the case with the anti-globalisation activists or those who are against NGOs, in order to be worried about possible confusions.
Moreover, what about certain general legal principles such as:
Presumption of innocence? Benefit of the doubt?
And who has the burden of proof?
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
We wish to once again affirm our complete and unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist acts witnessed in the United States of America, and the need to provide a response based on joint action and international cooperation within the UN that fully respects its Charter.
We must, however, state our strong disagreement with the method that the Commission has sought to impose in presenting its "draft regulation on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism" .
As part of the fight against terrorism, we feel it is necessary to adopt measures for combating organised crime, which specifically involve attacking money-laundering and the various forms of trafficking and abolishing tax havens.
We feel it is unacceptable, however, that a list of organisations and individuals, possibly supplied by the government and intelligence services of the United States - a country which not so long ago opposed any monitoring of tax havens - should be submitted for the approval of the European Parliament, when no supporting evidence has been provided.
Furthermore, it is our view that the necessary fight against terrorism must not be used as a pretext for influencing essential aspects of sovereignty of the Member States of the European Union.
It cannot be repeated often enough that we support the fight against international terrorism and we approve of taking initiatives to freeze funds if it can be shown that they belong to, or come from, individuals or organisations that carry out acts of terrorism.
We recognise the need to react quickly but believe, at the same time, that thorough reflection is important.
The proposal for a regulation is an expression of the fact that the EU is in a position to take action, but not to reflect.
If we are not voting against Parliament' s approval of the initiative, it is for the following reasons.
First of all, we do not believe that Parliament should be consulted on this issue, on which it has no influence.
We think it is completely unacceptable that Parliament should take a view on a regulation proposed by the Commission on the basis of the paper before us, which has been presented in a hurry and which Coreper criticises for lack of cohesion and consistency.
We believe that the procedure whereby Parliament is asked to approve the hasty adoption of the Council proposal is being used by the Council to legitimise a regulation on which thorough work has not been done.
The list attached to the proposal in Annex 1 is of organisations and individuals suspected of being directly or indirectly involved in acts of terrorism.
In our view, the fact that a list prepared in the United States has been approved without hesitation is a matter for criticism.
The proposal contains no guidelines as to how, or in accordance with which criteria, individuals or organisations are to be added to, or crossed off, the list, and it has not been specified which authorities are authorised to draw up the list and according to what principles.
We would criticise the fact that the proposal invalidates fundamental principles of a society governed by law, principles that protect those who have been accused against unfair and unlawful treatment.
It is a fact beneath contempt that the traditional, threefold division of power into legislative, judicial and executive authorities has been invalidated so that the EU can comply with the United States' desire for rapid intervention.
At the same time, it must be emphasised that no infringement of these principles can justify acts of terrorism.
. (SV) Naturally, I agree without reservation with the total condemnation of terrorism which constitutes the stated motive for this regulation.
However, both the decision process and content of the regulation constitute an insult to that very democracy and rule of law whose protection is claimed to be the aim of the proposal.
The European Parliament has been forced into rushed action without any reports, debate or access to the text of the legislation in many languages, including Swedish.
No positive reason has been given to explain why normal forms of democratic decision-making have to be bypassed.
As it is the Member States which in the final analysis will implement the proposed freezing of suspected terrorists' financial assets and as this must in any case be carried out through measures within each Member State, there is nothing to suggest that an EU regulation is required or that it will speed up the implementation of necessary measures.
At the same time, the regulation is a legal rush job and a mockery of all the grand statements to the effect that the fight against terrorism should not be perceived as a war against Islam or the Arab world.
The regulation contains no definition of terrorism, terrorists or terror organisations whatsoever.
Instead of the legislating body operating in the normal legal way by formulating a general definition of the crime and leaving it to the judicial system to trace, arrest, prosecute and judge those whose actions correspond to the definition of the crime confirmed by law, the legislating body, i.e. the Commission as proposer, the Council as decision-maker and the European Parliament as the body considering the proposal, has pre-empted the application of the law and circumvented the need for a definition of the crime by instead directly announcing 27 'guilty' organisations and people.
The origin of this list cannot be traced to any legal procedure whatsoever, but comes from the CIA.
The list contains a number of names with no more specific information - names which probably belong to several people.
In addition, all the names on the list are easily identifiable as Arabic/Muslim.
The result has been a diversion which is not needed in order for necessary measures to be taken in EU countries against terrorists' financial assets, which breaches fundamental legal principles and which must also be perceived as a one-sided political attack on the Muslim/Arab world.
Through its decision to adopt a number of amendments, the European Parliament has pointed to possible ways of partly, but far from entirely, reducing the deficiencies to which attention has been called.
I believe it would have been more just of the European Parliament in this situation to have shown its dissatisfaction unambiguously by recommending the complete rejection of the Commission' s proposal. In this way, the Commission would have been able to return with a new proposal which would have genuinely increased the chances of fighting terrorism, would have been based on legal principles and would have ruled out any suspicion that the proposal is one-sidedly directed against the Arabic/Muslim world.
Against this background, I, like a number of my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the proposal in the final vote.
The Commission' s proposal is not only contrary to Article 308 of the Treaty, but it also disregards elementary legal principles and the basic laws of the Member States.
The main reason why I cannot contribute to bringing about this legislation is that the effect of the Commission' s proposal would quite simply be to abolish any form of legal protection.
Even suspected criminals are entitled to fair trials.
It is this fundamental right that the Commission would have us abolish.
The United States has issued the Commission with a list of 27 individuals and organisations.
We have not been given any proof of the activities of these 27, not even the slightest explanation of why precisely these 27 should be judged without evidence and without trial.
What is being required of us is that we undertake to judge these 27 with blindfolds on - definitively and with no recourse to appeal.
We are to wield the rubber stamp here and now and, in classic Dr Strangelove style, shoot first and ask questions afterwards.
Are not democratic principles of law precisely what we wish to defend?
What will be next in line if we give in now and accept that the end justifies the means?
We have voted against this draft regulation because we do not think that appalling terrorist acts such as those on the World Trade Center can be opposed by violating fundamental freedoms.
This draft regulation quite simply asks us to trust the CIA in cutting off the means of subsistence from the 27 groups described, rightly or wrongly, as terrorists by the very agency which, more importantly, is behind some of them.
We did not wait for Mr Bush to denounce tax havens, but under no circumstances will we give his secret services a blank cheque.
The list, put forward with no explanation and which, we are warned, will be extended, no doubt in line with the interests of the USA and its allies, is only an alibi list when compared with the battle as a whole, against both tax havens and the perpetrators of death who profit from them.
As we definitely do not have the same definition of terrorism as Mr Bush, and as the list of the guilty remains open, we propose that the company TotalFinaElf should be added to it as the 28th organisation, as it is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths around the world and is directly linked to terrorist activities, particularly in Africa.
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the European Parliament' s amendment to the Council proposal for a regulation on specific arrangements placing restrictions upon certain persons and groups with a view to combating international terrorism.
We agree that the EU must combat international terrorism in all areas.
Nonetheless, we have general reservations about the proposal and, for example, reject the list of 27 terrorist organisations.
These organisations all appear to be Muslim, which may be construed as discrimination when there are also non-Muslim terrorist organisations.
These organisations ought, in the nature of the matter, to be included in the list, which cannot therefore be regarded as complete.
Moreover, we have reservations as to whether such a list can in practice be used at all.
I abstained on the final vote because although I agree with the principle behind this regulation, I cannot agree to the inclusion of Annex 1.
This regulation speaks about International Terrorism generally and does not specifically refer to the events of September 11.
Therefore it seems totally wrong for this Annex to be included which only refers to individuals and organisations who appear to be solely from the Islamic Community.
I am also concerned that the evidence against the people and organisations listed in the Annex has not been seen by European Parliamentarians and therefore we have not been able to decide for ourselves whether those listed are guilty of terrorism or not.
The European Parliament has been asked to act urgently and decisively to freeze funds that could be used for terrorists.
We have risen to this challenge, and in doing so have made essential amendments to protect liberties of innocent people.
I am personally proud of the amendment that demands action to give details that make persons named in the annex actually identifiable.
It would be absurd to go forward with a list of names that could refer ambiguously to thousands of people in the Islamic world, rolling innocent people in with sinister ones.
The Council of Ministers has called for speed and decisiveness.
We have responded and underlined the need for judicial safeguards fully compatible with decisive and immediate action.
We are effectively challenging the Council to keep faith with us and not delay matters by devising a new version without judicial safeguards.
We voted against this draft regulation for a number of reasons.
We strongly believe that granting such powers without proper debate and without a parliamentary report on the matter is legally questionable.
The fact that the protection of civil liberties is not addressed in the regulation is appalling, and the invoking of Article 308 sets a dangerous precedent for rushing through emergency legislation without any open and transparent debate.
It is also questionable whether the European Commission had the right to invoke this article in such circumstances and it could be in breach of some national constitutions.
The European Parliament was asked to vote on a list of 27 organisations without any explanation as to the basis under which they were chosen, who or what they are, and without any mention of safeguards if one of these organisations or persons was wrongfully accused.
We do not believe that the European Parliament has the right to act as judge and jury on such matters and most especially when the facts are not clearly explained in a transparent and open manner.
We of course welcome any new measures to combat terrorism; however, such measures must be properly thought out and properly debated in a transparent and democratic manner, not, as happened this week, in a atmosphere of panic.
Any new measures must enshrine human rights, protect civil liberties and recognise the assumption of innocence, if they are to be truly effective.
.
(NL) It is an old custom to isolate political opponents by labelling them terrorists.
When ex-terrorists became the leaders of South Africa, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and a very large number of former colonies, they suddenly became reasonable and respectable people in the eyes of many, and their former opponents were blamed - rightly so - for causing the violence.
By nipping in the bud every prospect of peaceful means towards a better life, they had driven the opposition to desperation.
That is why we must always draw a sharp distinction between opposition, in particular, campaigns resulting in socio-economic and administration changes, and irrational violence, which is only aimed at bringing about fear and destruction.
The American list of 27 suspected organisations with an Islamic background raises in some cases the suspicion that the support of governments in the battle against international terrorism is being bought by labelling their internal opponents terrorists as well.
We are, then, committing the same error as in making abortion, euthanasia and trading in soft drugs by inhabitants of Member States indictable offences where these are permitted by the legal administrations of other Member States.
In the justified battle against real terrorism, not everything now being proposed is fair and appropriate - not by a long chalk.
I do not agree with this ill-considered approach.
I believe that it is sensible to freeze the bank accounts of organisations or individuals who perpetrate or support acts of terrorism such as those which took place on 11 September 2001.
What has been submitted here, however, is a list of individuals and organisations who are merely assumed to have been involved in some way in the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.
However, it is possible to proceed against them, even without a judicial process or final proof.
Such a measure would be comparable with being remanded in custody, when suspects have not yet been found guilty in a court of law.
If no evidence of guilt is found, prisoners on remand are released and paid compensation.
No such provision is envisaged here.
Moreover, the clause contained in Article 2(2) enables other unpopular persons and organisations to be included on this legally dubious list.
Given that the Justice and Home Affairs Council has already talked about urban violence in connection with terrorism, I fear that this will make it possible to freeze the bank accounts of individuals or organisations who demonstrate against the EU's policies at European Councils, for example.
Had I voted in favour of this resolution, I would have given my support to a questionable and arbitrary act.
I therefore voted against the resolution despite my sharp condemnation of terrorism.
The members of the MPF group in this House have voted in favour of the Council regulation that makes provision for, following the Extraordinary European Council meeting in Brussels on 21 September, a number of measures to fight terrorism.
It is not the case that we think these measures in themselves constitute a total, satisfactory and coherent response to the formidable threat we face.
We simply think that it is a first step in the right direction and that we now need to tackle, without delay or taboos, the task of generally reviewing our legislation so that the intention expressed by the Presidency of the Council to conduct a policy against terrorism that is both 'global' and 'sustainable' does not remain some kind of mantra, but is something that can be translated into reality.
In this respect, some of the proposals made here yesterday by Minister Michel concern us, because they reflect the persistence among some of our leaders, despite the events of 11 September, of the same 'old way of thinking' , to use Mr Gorbachev' s expression, of the same ideological vein which for years has inspired, at European level, lax and demagogical measures with regard to the movement of people, which have led to us giving up control of our territory and have made the European Union an epicentre for Islamic terrorism.
When Mr Michel asserts that the wide-ranging legislative review advocated by our fellow member Mr Berthu that aims to make the safety of our people a priority 'leads straight towards a liberticidal society' , he is adding to this confusion that is the root of all of our shortcomings.
Is it not as a result of seeing every removal of controls as a step towards freedom that we have paved the way for terrorists such as those who went on to attack the United States?
The fact that any serious measure of control, particularly if it is a national measure, is still seen as a liberticidal proposal, says a great deal about how far there is to go before the old libertarian ideology is abandoned and before the debate can rise to the challenges we are having to face as a result of current events.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure).
Extraordinary European Council (RC B5-0666/2001)
Calling an Extraordinary European Council meeting was undoubtedly the right move following the terrorist attack in the United States.
Naturally the European Union is being cautious in its response, so far at least, but there a number of sensitive points which merit special attention:
a) the reference to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, without specifying the country from which the attack has emanated, creates a particularly dangerous climate of war and reckoning;
b) police measures to combat terrorism must be limited by respect for citizens' freedoms;
c) a policy needs to be defined towards "friendly" countries such as Saudi Arabia, which have helped by funding the spread of fundamentalism;
