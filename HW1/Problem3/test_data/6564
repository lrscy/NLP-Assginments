It is important not only for the survival of these regions, but also for the defence of the European agricultural model.
If we cease to support these crops, we shall be leaving the way open to Latin American multinationals, which consider the respect of social and environmental standards, or even human dignity itself, to be of secondary importance.
And we will be turning our back on the agricultural industry that we wish to build, an industry that is committed to environmental preservation, consumer protection and an industry that is concerned with the economic, social and also territorial cohesion of the European Union.
Mr President, both reports and most of the amendments are based on a political will to carry the Berlin decisions forward and to shape the enlargement of the Community on the basis of this European agricultural model.
The main issue is to maintain payments under the common market organisation, with quantity regulation needing to be achieved, as planned, by means of financial compensation.
This long-term approach has been one of the main pillars of the success of the common agricultural policy and it should not be underestimated.
It is certainly appropriate to increase competitivity at national level by means of cooperation models for developing rural areas as an economic factor in professional farming.
This presupposes high-quality production and a high degree of ecologically sound farming.
The main substance of both reports is that the multifunctionality of the European agricultural model needs to be secured in the long term.
Moving away from this model would mean standing still with regard to an approach that our citizens in the regions have only just begun to adopt.
What is lacking is a broad social debate about whether the risks of multifunctionality can be accepted.
I think they can.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I am against any economies of scale.
This is not something that the European agricultural model has called for up to now, and that is a testament to the common agricultural policy's scope for development and general possibilities.
Mr President, Commissioner, with the introduction of rural policy in the framework of Agenda 2000, a number of Member States took full advantage of the new funds that became available.
Unfortunately, the Dutch Government failed to come up with the goods. It expressed its view of the countryside by purchasing areas of outstanding natural beauty.
An outmoded view. By buying up farmers, the countryside disappears and is replaced by an artificial park landscape.
This is why I have tabled an amendment which should prevent this improper use of rural subsidies in future.
Rapporteurs Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos and Mr Fiori consider depopulation as one of the key problems facing the countryside, and consequently base their vision of rural policy on this premise.
They are basing their assumptions too much on the problems in their own Member States in this matter.
For example, depopulation is not a problem for the countryside in my region.
The Dutch countryside is, however, threatened by urbanisation and being turned into wasteland.
If the farmer can no longer acquire sufficient income from agriculture, he will look for all kinds of secondary activities.
Some of these activities affect the landscape, and it is also sad to see barns only being used as garages for caravans.
The European rural policy should consider these problems too.
Mr Fiori is doing this Parliament a disservice.
After the report on human genetics, this is his second report in the space of one year.
We would have liked to have sent a signal to the Commission by the mid-term review as to how we view the common agricultural policy.
Instead of looking for a common denominator, the rapporteur based his report on the Italian agricultural model, something which positively underwhelms the other Member States and this Parliament.
The report has become a paradoxical document which gives neither this Parliament nor the Commission, and certainly not the Council, anything to go on.
The European farmers deserve better.
Commissioner, when Agenda 2000 was signed in 1999 in Berlin we all breathed a sigh of relief as it began a period of budgetary calm in which multifunctionality had laid strong foundations guaranteeing the survival of a sustainable rural environment, in which quality, safety and respect for the environment had found their place.
The interim review is, therefore, key.
The common agricultural policy is currently undergoing a major change, due to the challenges that the European Union has to face, particularly with enlargement to the East and the negotiations with the World Trade Organisation.
The European Union is preparing to undertake a review of the CAP in 2003, which could be the prelude to a more in-depth reform planned for 2006.
One of the key elements in this debate is the modulation of aid from the market policy in order to transfer funds to the second pillar, to rural development, where we have been left short; in this way we will achieve a policy that many think will be more consistent with the agreements obtained at the WTO, as well as easing the path to accession.
What appears to be a laudable aim, however, could also be a double-edged sword.
We all want farmers to contribute to the sustainable maintenance of rural areas, but those areas cannot live without farmers, and what is more, if we try to achieve the final objective at any cost, we run the risk of using the wrong methods, because although we all want greater rural development, this cannot take place if it endangers the profitability of farming.
Any change made by the European Union to direct income aid must be done without damaging the income of farmers.
Therefore, if we accept the modulation of CAP aid, that modulation must take place according to parameters that do not put paid to the competitiveness of farms and that take into account the economic inequalities of the European Union.
We must therefore be extremely careful when passing on this message to society.
That careful attitude is, I think, what inspired the European Commission to decide to postpone the presentation of its proposal to revise the CAP for 2003 to 10 July, once the United States has passed its new farming law.
This new law represents a u-turn in United States policy by reintroducing a clear support for prices, which could place Community producers at a clear disadvantage.
The European Union cannot give in to the whims of any country when the future of its farmers is a stake.
I would like the European Commission to present its proposals to the European Parliament and very carefully weigh up the impact that the Farm Bill is going to have.
We should demand a report from the Community executive on that impact in order to be clear about this.
If we have to opt for modulation, it should be approached with care, taking a careful line that will not lead us to a point of no return for our farmers.
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the regulations adopted under Agenda 2000 have been a disaster for farmers.
Coresponsibility levies were increased during the recent review, while quotas were kept well below requirements and actual production, with the result that prices and farmers' incomes have collapsed.
Intervention prices and minimum prices have been slashed or abolished, leaving small and medium-sized farms prey to speculation by unaccountable industrial traders.
Decisions have been taken, such as to abolish tobacco subsidies, which will devastate huge areas in the Mediterranean countries, already among the poorest in the European Union. ?he entire production and food chain is being adulterated for the benefit of the huge food companies, resulting in well-publicised food scares, and not one proposal of any substance has been made to restructure plant production or deal efficiently with phenomena such as BSE.
This appalling situation will only be turned round if the principles and guidelines of Agenda 2000 are revised during the mid-term review of the CAP.
The odd minor improvement is a mere distraction, concealing what is a very ugly situation for small and medium-sized farmers, who are inevitably ousted from their land, which is then concentrated in the hands of a few capitalist-type companies.
Mr President, like many other things in this world, if we were designing from the beginning a common agricultural policy today, I doubt very much it would take the shape or form we presently have.
When I first became a Member of this Parliament, the Union was a lot smaller than it is today.
There were 9 countries with 20 million farmers.
Today the Union is much enlarged and there are only 6 million farmers.
So we have not succeeded in our original aim of maintaining the population in rural areas.
Nevertheless, the people of the European Union have not seen the common agricultural policy as a great failure.
They recognise that it has given us security of food supply.
They recognise that the quality of that food has improved over the years and, in spite of the fact that, from time to time we have scares and always will, the consumers of the European Union are relatively happy that we have given them a safe product.
I would like to point out that while we spend, relatively modestly, something like 0.4% of the GDP of the Union on this policy, the farmers, for example in Denmark and the United Kingdom get an average of about EUR 19 000 per capita, but if you go down to the bottom of the list, the half a million small farmers of Portugal get EUR 1 500.
So it is not a socially just policy.
Ireland is somewhere in between at EUR 11 000 per capita.
We have not succeeded in establishing a socially just situation.
Nevertheless, and in addition to having done what I said, we have also saved many rural areas; many habitations in towns, villages and communities have been saved by the policy.
We must re-design it in a way that will make it more socially just.
We must not forget that the business of agriculture is about producing food in the first place and we must ensure that food is safe.
Two things worry the farmers of Europe at the moment: the excessive paperwork they are required to do and the restrictions that are being imposed on them.
Food is being imported from other areas like, for example tinned food, chicken and other things, for which they cannot guarantee the safety and they are not happy about this.
The third thing is that we cannot see the future because we cannot get an agreement with the Americans.
We have to establish a system by which traceability of food, wherever it comes from, will be assured and we have to reach an understanding with our competitors in the world markets.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to very sincerely thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Fiori and Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, for their work, and I would also like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, under the chairmanship of Mr Daul, for its extensive contributions to the debate on the mid-term review.
As I see it, both reports fundamentally address what the shape of the common agricultural policy we want for the twenty-first century should be.
Trying to answer this question has stimulated a wide-ranging discussion of new ideas.
And new ideas are exactly what we need!
I believe that a debate of this kind needs to build on two principles.
Any future common agricultural policy needs to be sustainable across the board - economically, socially and also environmentally.
Furthermore, it must match what society wants and address the challenges of the moment.
But just what does society expect?
The answer is not necessarily as clear and straightforward as we might instinctively imagine. Agricultural policy needs to take account of various aspects.
The citizens of the European Union know very well that agriculture does not just produce food these days.
They therefore expect it to fulfil a variety of roles.
It is therefore up to us to support all those functions.
When we talk about the interests of society, we should not forget that farmers are also part of our society, so that their needs also have to be taken into consideration if we are to ensure that our agriculture is socially sustainable.
We need to look at society's expectations as a whole and at the same time to consider the concerns of rural communities.
I have always said that reform of the CAP is a continuing process.
We began that process back in 1992, ten years ago, and we now have an opportunity to carry it forward with the mid-term review.
This mid-term review will also give us a chance to establish what adjustments we should make to instruments under the CAP in order to meet society's expectations more effectively.
I say that because if things are going wrong in a given sector, we need to act now. We cannot wait until 2006, even if the Berlin Summit did not stipulate any specific review remit.
I am pleased that the Fiori report specifically recognises this.
However, we also intend to take account of the possible impact of the US Farm Bill in our analysis, and also of the work due to be published by the US Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute, the FAPRI, probably at the beginning of June.
The draft of our mid-term review will then be presented on 10 July.
That will above all make it possible for us to take on board the comments you have made in your reports and in this House today.
The Fiori report contains a great many specific ideas, but because of the divergence of interests in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I assume in this House in general, they are not always totally consistent.
For example, on the one hand the report calls for a system of direct aid not linked to production, but on the other hand it calls for production-related aid to be increased in various areas.
Of course, all these points need to be discussed in detail.
However, you should not forget that careful preparatory work is also needed for those sectors for which no review was agreed upon in Berlin, such as sugar, fruit, vegetables, olive oil and so on.
Only then will the Commission be in a position to make any proposals.
So we will not be in a position to present a second package until next year.
When it comes to rice, however, I do not think that we should wait for the impact of the Everything But Arms initiative to be felt in full.
I think that we should be considering now how to react to the challenges associated with that initiative.
I am pleased to see that although the Fiori Report deals primarily with markets, that is to say the first pillar of the CAP, it recognises that rural development should be given a higher profile.
I therefore consider the references to eco-conditionality very interesting.
Although the US Farm Bill has now been adopted, we should keep up our efforts to make our common agricultural policy more viable for the future. I say that not only because the new Farm Bill is very much a case of do as I say, not do as I do.
This policy belies all the United States' talk over the years about a trade-oriented agenda.
That is unacceptable and you can be sure that I will continue to criticise this.
However, I am also just as convinced that we in the European Union should not make the same mistake and back-pedal on the common agricultural policy.
Just the opposite, in fact.
We should continue along the present path of reinforcing the multifunctional aspects of our agricultural policy.
This will particularly help us in the WTO context, where the Americans' behaviour has been sharply criticised by most of their WTO partners.
That brings me to Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' report.
The motion for a resolution generally takes the same line as the Commission on the future direction and role of rural development policy.
In particular, I believe that the further transfer of funds from the first pillar to the second pillar gives an important signal.
If we transfer some 10% of agricultural expenditure from the EAGGF to the second pillar we will not be able to achieve the much-vaunted objectives adopted by the Heads of State and Government at the Gothenburg Summit in July last year.
Nevertheless, the common agricultural policy is expected to contribute to sustainable development.
It is to attach greater weight to promoting more healthy and high-quality products, environmentally friendly production methods, renewable primary products and the protection of biodiversity.
That is why I also support the statement in the Ramos report that the first and second pillar of the common agricultural policy were conceived as a coherent whole and must complement each other.
So what are the budgetary implications of Agenda 2000?
As has been confirmed today, we have used EUR 2 billion less every year than was originally envisaged.
We are therefore using taxpayers' money very responsibly, and that is why, with an eye to enlargement, we have suggested that direct payments should be made over a period of 10 years, so that on the one hand the fifteen Member States are not overstretched in budget terms and on the other hand so as not to obstruct the restructuring process in the candidate countries.
However, it is also evident from this that the agriculture budget, as the budget of the only fully communitarised policy at EU level, should not be exploited to finance other policies, especially if we are expecting the agricultural sector simultaneously to perform services that it can never afford to provide on the basis of market prices.
I would like to conclude by addressing a further point that goes beyond the mid-term review but which is nevertheless important for the future, and which is therefore something that we need to bear in mind when we are considering how to develop the common agricultural policy in future.
As far as I am concerned, just like the new Farm Bill, this issue is not sufficiently covered in the two reports.
No matter how willing I was to support the Everything But Arms initiative to support the world's poorest countries, because it helped us a great deal in Doha and will continue to help us, I nevertheless feel that I need to urge some caution about the idea of extending these principles to all developing countries.
I do not want to cover all the issues that have occurred to me during this debate; I would like to restrict myself to just two.
If the European Union is to open up its agricultural markets to developing countries without any restrictions, then mechanisms need to be found beforehand to prevent multinationals persuading farmers in developing countries to abandon their traditional land management methods for large-scale monoculture of products suitable for export.
Because that would achieve exactly the opposite of what Parliament has demanded on many other occasions.
If, in addition, genetically modified plants are cultivated in developing countries, for example for fighting disease and improving food provision, the EU cannot at the same time refuse imports solely on the grounds that they contain GMOs.
Ensuring food safety and food quality are issues of vital importance for the acceptance of the common agricultural policy.
These issues therefore need to be gone into in greater depth if we want to address our consumers' justified concerns.
I would like to emphasise that point too in the mid-term review.
Lastly, I would like to thank the rapporteurs once more for the enormous effort they have devoted to bringing together and coordinating widely varying views and interests in a convincing way.
Thank you Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0130/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector [15396/2/2001 - C5-0035/2002 - 2000/0189(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Cappato).
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the over 17 thousand people who, in the space of a very few days, as soon as the news appeared on the Internet that we wanted to include in a first pillar instrument on the harmonisation of the internal market an explicit reference to the possibility of requiring the retention of data, of all data - e-mail, telephone, Internet, SMS and mobile phone communications - have roused themselves: 50 US organisations, the American Civil Liberty Union and many others have risen up in opposition to this idea and this proposal, which is still the most serious, controversial point for us, a point which the PPE-DE/PSE compromise has attempted to include in our directive in line with the Council recommendations, acting against the European Parliament's position at first reading, acting against the position and the recommendations of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
This late hour is not particularly worthy of such an important debate and, what is more, it might have been a sign of respect if the Member of this Parliament who introduced these compromise amendments, acting against all the positions of the committee which she chairs, had come tonight, at least to explain to us, to attempt to convince us why we miserable half-dozen Members who are still in the Chamber should, together with our groups and the other Members, accept a u-turn on the positions adopted at first reading.
The situation is becoming absurd: a directive on the protection of privacy will become a directive clamping down mercilessly on ... on what?
On unsolicited commercial e-mails.
With regard to this matter - as my colleagues know - I have my own opinion, with which some people do not agree: I believe that it is not legislation, opting in or opting out, which will help us to combat unsolicited e-mails, and spamming is already banned on four or five grounds under the existing directives.
Imposing one more ban will not make us any more capable of securing compliance with these rules.
I would, however, ask the Members, particularly those who are of the opinion that receiving an unsolicited e-mail constitutes a major violation of privacy, how can you, especially you, accept the introduction, against all the legal bases - and I would ask the Presidency to examine this point too, to ascertain whether these amendments are acceptable - of an explicit provision stipulating that, although this is a directive harmonising the internal market, with this directive we are going to authorise the Member States - they already have that authorisation, and if they already have it, why include it, why add it now - to implement blanket data retention, with a view to requiring the blanket retention of personal data in electronic communications?
Everyone is urging us not to do it: the companies, because of the costs involved - but, we could say, who cares about the companies; the non-governmental organisations; the organisations concerned with freedoms on the Internet; the European Data Protection Supervisor, instituted by Article 29, who is the chairman of the Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data, who had adopted a position of consensus - or rather, we followed his recommendations at first reading - on the guarantees which are necessary if any form of exception is to be adopted.
But no!
We have decided, or rather it has been decided by the PPE-DE/PSE compromise, that all that had to be abandoned.
And why?
In order to reach a compromise?
No, for we have accepted the positions proposed by the Council in their entirety.
I realise that people can have requirements; I can understand the fact that the Spanish Presidency wants to bring this dossier to a close: I expect that these are the requirements of some of the Members of this House.
What I do not understand, however, is how these considerations, alone, have managed to sway, are swaying the overall position of the House.
It has even been said - and I think this is the worst thing that has been said to us - not in this debate, for, of course, this debate is taking place after the decisions have been made, but in recent debates we have held - that the positions were the opposite of what was being proposed.
There has not been a convincing debate and, indeed, those who proposed the changes are not in the House to attempt to persuade us tonight.
Has the fight against terrorism been mentioned?
Do we need the clause on combating terrorism in an instrument harmonising and liberalising telecommunications?
No, we do not!
It is a lie: all the analysts were unanimous after September 11 in declaring that it was not data that we lacked but the capacity to analyse that data.
What we need now is precisely an action combating crime which can invest in the capacity to analyse data, and requiring the blanket retention of data concerning all the citizens would be to take the completely opposite path, to set off in the direction of the mistakes made.
I therefore call - and I am almost ashamed of my vehemence but I feel that, ultimately, the few Members remaining in the House deserve it - for the positions assumed to be changed once again, and I call for at least that clause which has nothing whatsoever to do with the matter - it is a third pillar clause, a clause relating to cooperation, justice and home affairs, which includes the possibility for Member States to make laws requiring the blanket retention of data - for that unlawful clause, at least, to be removed from our directive.
Mr President, since the vote in committee we have attempted to reach a compromise with the Council on the contentious points.
We all wanted to avoid a conciliation procedure, but not - let me make this quite clear now - at any price!
Mrs Paciotti made things very simple from the outset and specifically stated that she would support all the points that the Council accepted.
That really is a strange position for a Member of Parliament to adopt!
Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi then tabled certain proposals for compromise with the Council on behalf of our group, and we have negotiated on that package in countless meetings and discussions also involving the Presidency.
The Council has of course, as always, now very cleverly unpicked our package for tactical reasons and negotiated all the proposals for compromise individually with the various interested parties.
That means that for the time being we have accepted a compromise on data retention under which there can be standard legal deviations from the general European legislation at national level, rather than having decisions made on a case-by-case basis.
We have also abandoned the idea of a time limit and have therefore almost totally accepted the Council's position.
In the case of e-mail advertising, despite having major reservations we have agreed to the general opt-in.
However, I regarded it as being a condition that the area of application should be broad if there is already contact between interested parties and companies.
But instead we now have a very limited wording: companies can only advertise similar products and products already inquired about by customers.
The area of application we suggested has also had the word 'cooperations' taken out.
I could have accepted all these restrictions as a compromise, and could also accept this if the Council had made some concessions to us on the final issue and had really accepted the opt-out position for directories of subscribers.
However, in this case the Council was only willing to agree on a variant in which the decision is left to the Member States.
However, that means that the Council would not even have remotely accepted any of Parliament's key points.
I scarcely regard that as acceptable, and that is why I repeat that I wish to avoid the reconciliation procedure, but not at any cost!
If the Council wants to play poker on this, we can play that game too, and for us that means remaining resolute and supporting Mr Cappato's Amendment No 14.
Otherwise we will essentially only have lost ground during the unofficial negotiations, and not gained anything at all.
Mr President, here we are again, voting for third time on the proposal for an amendment to the directive on the data protection in the telecommunications sector and discussing opting in and opting out.
Unlike the rapporteur, I am still firmly in favour of the citizens having the right to choose initially whether or not their data should be inserted in public directories and whether or not they wish to receive unsolicited communications.
I am pleased to note that this is the position of both the Commission and the Council, which have also proved willing to achieve compromise solutions that go some way towards meeting some of the more reasonable demands of telecommunications undertakings.
That is why Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and I have supported new compromise amendments.
If these amendments are adopted, we will, at last, after tomorrow's vote, have a new major directive which will help to develop the electronic market while safeguarding the citizens' fundamental rights.
To this end, we also had to find a solution which was acceptable to the Council to the issue of retaining data for the purposes of protecting national security.
In my country, Italy, these data are kept for five years.
Article 14 of the present directive already stipulates that the Member States can adopt legislative measures seeking to limit the confidentiality rights in respect of communications necessary for the safeguarding of national security.
The solution laid down in compromise Amendment No 46 adds that, in accordance with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, these measures must be appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society, that data retention is only admissible for a limited period, and that the legislation on the subject must comply with the principles contained in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and therefore, in particular, with those enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the shared constitutional traditions of the Member States which are now - these traditions - included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Like all solutions which have to strike a balance between different interests, this one has to be assessed in the overall context.
I feel that the solution is sensible and sustainable, for the European Parliament certainly does not have the power to make the Council prevent the Member States keeping traffic data for reasons of national security.
We cannot prevent this; what we can do is provide a framework of guarantees and certainties safeguarding fundamental rights so that future legislation has to respect them.
Mr President, my group deplores the way this matter has been handled in the last few weeks.
Both the vote in the Citizens' Rights Committee and the rapporteurs have been pushed aside and there has been a cosy stitch-up between the Presidency and the leadership of the two big groups.
My group will uphold the committee agreement by voting for an opt-out system on directories to be possible.
We will seek to take out the bureaucratic limitation that direct marketing e-mails can only be for products similar to those previously bought.
But our main concern is the attempt by the Council and the big groups to confer broad powers to require telecommunications companies and Internet service providers to keep data which map people's daily lives and contacts, that is traffic, billing, location data and so on for possible access by law enforcement agencies.
We do not disregard the case for some data retention for security practices, but we oppose its insertion in this directive because the huge implications both for industry and civil liberties are not adequately addressed in this context.
It is dangerous and premature, and surely of doubtful legality as Mr Cappato said, to endorse a blanket EU regime of data retention as an add-on to a telecommunications single market package.
Any imposition of these powers should be debated at national parliament level and then addressed in the context of EU cooperation on policing and crime-fighting, including guarantees for citizens' rights.
This measure today, being an internal market directive, is part of the package designed to open up the EU market to competition and enable telecoms and ISPs to operate on a level playing field.
That is why the original Commission proposal did not contain any reference at all to data retention, which was added by the Council.
I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's response on that.
We need a proper and extensive public debate.
Slipping through these huge powers in the slipstream of a liberalisation measure is quite inappropriate.
Mr President, my group is extremely surprised at the turn this debate has taken.
Only last week, the majority of our committee appeared to be opposed to an opt-in of unsolicited electronic mail, but since the PPE-DE has adopted a more flexible approach, the majority now seems to be in favour of this opt-in, in which case the Spanish Presidency is granted the honour of bringing this dossier to a successful end.
This generous flexibility reminds me of something Groucho Marx once said: 'Those are my principles.
If you don't like them, I have others?.
I should not, however, be so condescending about the outcome of this U-turn.
In all Member States, it is now prohibited to place cookies and send non-directed e-mail, SMS or fax messages to people who have not asked for them.
Unlike Mr Cappato, I do think this is a good idea, but it is true that this ban will also need to be enforced if we actually want to bring about a change.
I do not only want to express satisfaction, however.
First of all, something I am really unhappy about and that has already been mentioned by the Liberals, is that these days negotiations appear to be taking place not between the Council and Parliament, but between the Council and two groups.
Moreover, I am of the opinion that the compromise that these two groups have reached concerning data protection is not such a good one.
I fully endorse what Baroness Ludford has said in this connection.
Why are we as Parliament, in this first-pillar document, over which Parliament therefore has control, now willingly and explicitly encouraging the Council to conclude agreements about the systematic registration of people's surfing behaviour and other electronic activities in the third pillar, behind closed doors and with minimum parliamentary and judicial control?
We should simply study this aspect more carefully and not simply include it in this directive, which deals with completely different matters.
Let us not get the first and third pillars mixed up.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you too will have received the letter from the various citizens-rights groups dealing with the very point that has now become key in this directive.
The issue is whether data retention should be permitted, that is to say the storage of communications data.
What is at stake here is not just a move to a little more surveillance, but a whole new type of state monitoring.
Up to now the police and other parties have had legal access only to what was said or written at the time of surveillance.
This document is intended to make it possible to access communications after the event, thus restricting fundamental rights retrospectively.
This is a new kind of police state aimed at intruding into our private lives.
For example, what happens to data the state collects about you and your Internet surfing patterns?
That data is stored and passed onto the next government.
No one knows who will have access to it then - it could be the normal authoritarian Social Democrats, or it could be Le Pen, Haider or Rasmussen.
After all, even before 11 September no one was aware to what extent fundamental rights were being whittled away with the agreement of western democrats.
We have experience in Germany of such preventive restrictions on fundamental rights.
The Radikalenerlass, or Radicals Decree, did not just involve charging those affected with illegal acts, it also related to acts merely regarded as undesirable by the government.
So the effect of the directive we are debating today could be that if I download information about right-wing radicalism from the Internet now I could at some point in the future lose my job as a civil servant.
This document still includes the term data protection, although it no longer relates to data protection.
The only thing still to be decided is what the title will be of the planned Council proposal requiring data retention throughout the European Union.
The directive before us today is preparing the way for that proposal to extend monitoring by the state across Europe.
Mr President, it is very sad. The name of Mr Cappato, who is so hardworking and friendly, has almost become a swearword among MEPs and civil servants who have worked long and hard on this matter.
Despite a compromise, the European Parliament and the Council are still far apart.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to feel satisfied with the result, but separate national regulations would create even greater differences and even more problems.
There is a great risk and lack of consistency in the Council's position whereby the issue of the Data Act would be included in the directive.
Issues which fall under the third pillar quite simply do not work in a directive within the framework of the first pillar.
The pillar system quite simply does not work, and the Commission, which has just notified us of this, is aware of the fact.
Now, we are told that a framework decision is being planned on general surveillance.
Citizens have reason to be worried.
The EU must not proceed too quickly on these important issues which, under the guise of data protection, risk limiting the protection of personal privacy.
A proper discussion is needed between industry, politicians and interest groups before we proceed further with more new legislation.
Maybe we just need to look a little closer at what other countries have done, such as the United States.
The issues must be subjected to democratic and legal controls.
I place my hope in the European Convention in this respect.
I campaigned on the issue of costs even during the previous term of office.
I returned to the issue in my report on the strategy for 'Creating a safer information society by improving the security of information infrastructures and combating computer-related crime? (A5-0284/01).
This is quite a while ago now.
Light must be shed upon the costs of compulsory data storage and of searching for information.
I have received a positive response from the Commission on this subject, both in writing and orally.
It is good to hear that the Commission has taken these arguments on board and promised to get back to us on this issue.
I will content myself with this welcome message and have therefore withdrawn my request on this matter.
I also hope that the Commission really will get back to us on the question so that we are able to address it not so as to adopt fixed positions at an early stage but so as to obtain reasonable relations between the United States and the EU.
Mr President, I want to deal with two issues; one is data retention and the other is opt-in, opt-out.
First of all, opt-in, opt-out.
I have to say, it is absolutely appalling, in any arena of politics, to set expectations which cannot be met.
The whole idea of opt-in has been put forward as the solution to end spam.
Let me put this on the record.
The Commission's proposals on opt-in will not stop one iota of spam whatsoever.
Spammers do not abide by laws or regulations.
They operate offshore and if we want to drive SMEs, the so-called engine of the new economy, out of the EU, then this is the way to do it.
On the issue of data retention, Groucho Marx has been referred to tonight.
Actually, there were three brothers and the contributions I have heard tonight lead me to believe that the three brothers Groucho, Chico and Harpo are present.
The whole deletion of this article on data retention which is now being called for was never, ever called for in committee.
What is this idea that it is a stitch-up, that groups come together to reach a compromise that ill serves the civil liberties of ordinary men and women?
Civil liberties, let us remind ourselves, need protecting from the international terrorists who operate cross-border terrorism, drug-trafficking, transnational crime, the trafficking of women and children.
These are the civil liberties that we seek to protect with these proper, balanced data retention rules that are in the proposals before Parliament.
I hope Parliament does the sensible thing, which is to vote in favour of the data retention proposals.
We must respect the civil liberties of our citizens, and we do, but equally, we must not allow those who operate across our borders to abuse civil liberties to promote their crimes.
I could say a lot more, but thankfully my time is up.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive we are debating this evening is desperately needed, as it forms the coda of the telecommunications package that we adopted last year.
We must ensure that our citizens and businesses do not receive unsolicited e-mail, that their personal details are not included in telephone directories without their permission, and that their surfing behaviour is not secretly registered via cookies.
All these areas are covered very effectively in the proposal - in fact in a harmonised manner - the only correct way in our digital, cross-border world.
However, I am unable to support the proposal on data storage.
In fact, I cannot understand how the Commission can back the Council proposal.
Has the Commissioner ever considered how much it would cost telecom operators and surf providers to store all this data for years on behalf of businesses, how much storage this would require and how much it would cost altogether?
In times of war, a state is always inclined to prioritise state security over the privacy of the citizens.
But there is no war.
We must protect the privacy of our citizens and stick our necks out for this.
And this is exactly what we are doing today.
Mr President, it is just as well that this is the second reading, when we should have just been fine-tuning a few positions!
It would seem, however, that we are faced with almost a complete overturning of what was agreed at first reading: there has been a major reshuffling of the cards which has enabled the different groups to review the positions they had taken before, to alter them and to propose compromises which are frankly quite perplexing.
We must draw a veil over the matter, so to speak, in any case, and remember what it is we are actually discussing.
We are discussing a proposal for a directive which seeks to amend the previous European Parliament and Council directive - Directive 97/66 of 15 December 1997, to be exact - which laid down provisions on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector, and bring it into line with technological innovations which have taken place which were actually quite foreseeable.
I would reiterate my reservations, which I have already voiced at first reading, about the usefulness and effectiveness of rules which are so specific, too specific in their regulation of the telecommunications sector and therefore too invasive of citizens' privacy.
I still feel that it is possible to apply the standards which are currently in existence and endorsed at European level to achieve the same end while avoiding the risk of overregulation, of excessive regulation, that is.
We need to avoid this alleged respect for privacy leading to the establishment of two systems or a system with two different sets of rules, which would mean, first and foremost, excessive protection of the citizens' privacy and laying down excessively restrictive rules in the private sector, while leaving the Member States, on the other hand, absolutely free to intervene for their own purposes in the lives of the citizens themselves, for example requiring electronic communication service providers to perform tasks which almost amount to police work.
Lastly, I trust that I will not upset anyone if I say that I agree with the rapporteur when he says, in Amendment No 4, that cookies are ultimately acceptable, almost legitimate tools, for they make it easier to understand how to surf the Internet, providing clear, exhaustive information; in other words, they make the surfer more alert. What I mean to say is I do not believe that surfers are victims of cookies.
Another issue is spamming, against which we are completely defenceless: those who indulge in this practice do what they want to when they want to and, most importantly, in the quantities and with the quality they want to.
At this point, I do not believe it will be easy to produce a directive which everyone can support.
We have tried.
If it were possible - and I know the Rules of Procedure do not permit it - we should resort to a third reading: it may be only then that we would find that point of convergence and consensus which, at this point, at this moment in time, we are realising that we have failed to reach with two readings.
Mr President, this is the final directive package in the field of telecommunications.
Fortunately we did not wait for this draft to stagger in as otherwise the other directives would also have been late too.
It has not been long since we realised that a crime is a crime also on the Internet and the fact that you can conceal your identity cannot release anyone from responsibility even electronically.
You cannot even send e-mail if the recipient does not want it.
Unlike paper-based advertising, this is often at the expense of the recipient.
Therefore I am in favour of the compromise with the Council which supports the opt-in view.
Direct marketing is possible over the Internet if the consumer has given permission for it in advance.
I also support several other compromises.
The result is not perfect by any means, but it is an indication of how far we have come.
'Internet insecurity', actual anarchy, is a major threat to the entire e-Europe project, the information-based economy and the advancement of democracy.
This, ladies and gentlemen, is about the fact that business on the Internet must be safe and that health information must be able to be stored on it reliably.
Security has become a major issue on the Internet, and therefore, as presented in the e-Europe 2005 programme, we need a network security unit which monitors security but also respects civil rights on the net.
This is our major common need and our aim.
Mr President, the new electronic communications regulatory framework entered into force a month ago on 24 April.
The proposed electronic communications data protection directive is the only element of the package still to be agreed between this House and the Council.
Adequate rules on the protection of privacy on line are just as essential for the sector as rules to ensure competitive markets.
Today, I would like to ask you to join in the ongoing effort to try and reach an agreed solution on this directive at its second reading to avoid any further delay.
The seven compromise elements that have been tabled by the PPE-DE and PSE, together with three amendments submitted by the Citizens' Freedom Committee and five further amendments submitted by the PPE-DE constitute a package of compromise texts that are acceptable both to the Council and the Commission.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Cappato, who has put a lot of time and energy into this file.
May I also pay special credit to Mrs Palacio and Mrs Paciotti, for their continuous efforts to try and find an overall package that would be acceptable to all institutions involved.
On all four main and outstanding issues, some balanced solutions are now on the table.
All sides have had to make concessions and nobody is perfectly happy with every element of the package as is the nature of a compromise.
On cookies, Amendments Nos 25 and 26 align the relevant provisions with the general data protection directive.
On unsolicited e-commercial mail, the Council has accepted further concessions to accommodate those in Parliament not in favour of a harmonised policy.
Amendments Nos 9, 18, 28, 44 and 45 are acceptable, both for the Council and the Commission.
The exception clause would apply to direct marketing by the same company of similar categories of products or services.
One such category could, for instance, be books, CDs and DVDs.
Another category could be household appliances.
This is really as far as we can go without ending up with unsatisfactory solutions for both citizens and businesses.
We need a clear, harmonised approach for the entire EU market, that does not force customers to pay the bill for unwanted direct marketing by e-mail, SMS and other message services.
This is the best boost for electronic messaging services and e-commerce in general.
On traffic data retention, discussions have been particularly difficult.
The Commission appreciates the strong feelings in this House regarding the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms.
The Commission fully shares these feelings and, like Parliament, is currently promoting the inclusion of a Charter on Fundamental Human Rights in the EU Treaty, so that it will become legally binding and directly enforceable.
As we have said from the start of the discussions, the directive we are debating today is not a third pillar instrument.
It imposes legal limitations on what we can usefully include in the provisions of the directive, both with regard to any national measures for public security or crime-fighting and with regard to safeguarding individual rights and freedoms.
As the Commission has emphasised in its recent submission to the European Convention, we think that the separation between the three pillars causes numerous difficulties and should therefore be abandoned.
But as long as the pillars exist, we are forced to respect them, because the European Court of Justice would not uphold any third pillar elements included in a first pillar directive.
For similar reasons, we cannot introduce a provision on the cost of law enforcement measures in this directive, as proposed in Amendment No 39.
Nevertheless, I can assure Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld that the Commission will actively pursue this matter with the Member States.
The compromise Amendments Nos 46 and 47 jointly submitted by PPE-DE and PSE signify a very important improvement of the Council's common position on the topic of data retention.
They strengthen considerably the human rights aspect of the relevant provisions and also refer to case law by the Strasbourg Court on the European Convention of Human Rights.
The Commission fully supports these improvements and urges the European Parliament to do the same.
However, if the sentence on data retention is deleted from Amendment No 46 as proposed by the requested split vote, the whole compromise would unravel and this would surely lead to conciliation with an even more uncertain outcome.
The Commission understands the concerns that have motivated the request for a split vote, but feels that the current text addresses these concerns sufficiently.
Finally, the issue of public subscriber directories remains to be solved.
While less debated that the opt-in for solicited commercial e-mail, similar issues are at stake for proposed harmonised opt-in regarding directories.
A non-harmonised solution as proposed in Amendment No 35 is not sustainable with the internal market.
In summary, an agreed overall solution between all institutions is within reach if the European Parliament tomorrow accepts Amendments Nos 9, 13, 18, 25, 26, 28, 37, 38 and 44 to 50.
The result will be a directive with great added value for European citizens and for the development of the information society.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0136/2002), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on public access to environmental information and repealing Council Directive 90/313/EEC [11878/1/2001 - C5-0034/2002 - 2000/0169(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Korhola).
Mr President, the European Union's environmental policy is ambitious and good in several areas.
Implementing it successfully is, however, almost impossible without the support of our own citizens.
A precondition for obtaining the support of our citizens is that our environmental work is transparent.
This is the aim of the proposed directive under discussion today.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m said when the proposal first underwent its first reading over a year ago that if we are to achieve the conditions required for sustainable development, we have to start by making our national environmental policy the centre of attention.
Thus Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is quite correctly linking this directive to the long and vitally, in the literal sense, important process which began in Rio in 1992, ten years ago next week.
Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development concerns the participation of citizens and the Aarhus Convention is a significant step towards putting that principle into practice.
As well as being signed by the Community, the Aarhus Convention has been signed by all fifteen Member States, but the Community has not yet managed to progress to ratification as the existing legislation does not yet comply with the Convention.
The directive being proposed is the first pillar in ratifying the Aarhus Convention.
The second pillar concerns public participation and Parliament will be able to start the second reading in the near future, as at the start of tomorrow's session it will be announced that the Council's common position has finally been received.
This being the case, today I submitted a draft recommendation concerning the second reading of the second pillar to the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
The third pillar aiming at ratifying the Aarhus Convention concerns access to justice and a proposal regarding this is currently being prepared by the Commission.
In addition, the rules of the Union's institutions must also be checked to ensure they conform to the Aarhus Convention.
The Commission has promised that during June it will provide information on actions that are still required and a more precise timetable for these.
It is hoped that the Commission will be able to confirm this today.
When I was drafting the recommendation for a second reading to be discussed today, I took into account the fact that in the first reading Parliament was exceptionally unanimous and accepted all the amendments proposed.
Thus the recommendation for second reading will in practice repeat everything that Parliament accepted on the first reading which has not yet been included in the Council's common position.
The Council has also made a number of important proposals worthy of support, among which I would especially mention the Council's definition of a public authority, which is an improved adaptation of the wording proposed by Parliament, as well as the Council's adaptation of the point concerning access to justice.
The Council also proposes that historical documents, in other words documents received or created before the directive has entered into force be made electronically available, for example on the Internet at the discretion of the authority in question.
I also recommend that this should be approved.
The Council has not, however, taken into account Parliament's proposal on reducing the time-limit within which authorities must respond from one month to two weeks.
The recommendation includes a compromise proposal, which has been copied from an act based on Article 255 of the Treaty of Rome, on access to information held by the Union's institutions, which was accepted after the first reading of this directive proposal.
As such, the compromise proposes that a response should be given within 15 working days, that is, at least three weeks, which can be doubled where there is a justification.
After the first reading, our British colleagues in the main put forward a concern about the fate of the sale of commercial information by authorities.
I am convinced that weather services and map information do not even fall within the scope of this directive and even if they did, they would be protected in a carefully considered list of exceptions.
However, having heard about this concern, the committee decided to remove part of item 2 of the article that deals with charging.
In my opinion this was a rushed gesture, and I did not see it as the best way of resolving the matter.
To rectify this situation, the Greens, the Liberals and the Left Group have jointly tabled Amendment No 48 to emphasise the general principle that the information should be free of charge.
There is nothing wrong with the amendment in itself.
I support it, but in my view the original amendment rejected by the committee was better, as this new version is unlikely to delight the British either.
The directive on public access to environmental information is intended to be implemented before the end of the current year.
The second reading of the second pillar of the Aarhus Convention will probably be ready before Parliament's summer recess and it is likely that we will receive information from the Commission on the timetable for the third pillar and other necessary action within the same time frame.
The Aarhus Convention has thus progressed many steps towards ratification and implementation in the European Union.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. Mr President, it is perhaps a pity we do not seem to have the same sense of urgency over this report, giving a right of citizens to access to information, as we have over telecoms liberalisation, but I shall pass over that.
It is very important to emphasise that this directive does not grant a concession.
It lays down practical arrangements for the exercise of a right which belongs to the citizens.
So amendments, such as Nos 1, 5 and 10 which stress the existence of this right, are very important.
Another aspect of the Committee's second reading report which should be stressed is the need to make sure that the dissemination of environmental information keeps up with modern means of communication technology.
That is an important aspect that we would like to persuade the Council to take on board.
The stress that is put on improving the quality of the information made available so that it is comprehensible, accurate and comparable is also very valuable.
There is no point in having access to information if it is too complex or too opaque to be comprehensible to the layman - it renders such access meaningless.
We also very much welcome the fact that the rapporteur seeks to ensure that any restriction on the right of information should only be allowed in specific, clearly-defined and exceptional cases.
Also that there should be a 'harm' test, so that the harm must outweigh the benefits of disclosure if disclosure is to be denied.
All these are very important.
I welcome Mrs Korhola's acceptance of Amendment No 48 and, although she does not think it is perfect, I am very glad she can accept it.
Mr President, Commissioner, we all agree that information is a basic principle of democracy.
Free access to and the transparency and dissemination of environmental information are a fundamental right of every citizen with an interest in the quality of his or her living and working environment.
Accessibility to the environmental statistics kept by public agencies is of crucial importance, not just in improving public awareness but also in safeguarding the trust and democratic involvement of our citizens.
As we saw after the first reading, the Council adopted very few of the amendments to the common position approved by plenary.
So we have no choice but to re-table all the amendments on important matters such as exceptions at second reading.
We really must, I think, keep exceptions to a minimum, so as to ensure that any interested party can access a broad range of information.
Similarly, the fifteen-day deadline by which the administration must respond to a request for environmental information does, I think, give government agencies time enough, while ensuring that interested parties are able to use information promptly and efficiently.
Another important point is the charge for supplying information.
I think it should be capped at the real cost of reproducing the information, in order to make it as easy as possible for the public to access information and to ensure that no one is discouraged from acquiring environmental information because of the cost.
I trust that the European Commission will respond positively to these comments and that we can proceed and ratify the Aarhus Convention as quickly as possible
Finally, Mr President, I should like on behalf of my political group to give my full backing to the report by our rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, and to congratulate her on a job well done.
Mr President, I am extremely pleased, and satisfied about the fact, that we are now to obtain a directive on public access to environmental information which is completely in line with the Arabs Convention.
I also think that the rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, is entirely correct in reinstating the majority of amendments from the first reading, as they were adopted unanimously by Parliament.
They are also excellent in helping to improve the Commission's proposals.
The new Article 7a, on the quality of environmental information, is one of the most important amendments.
As has already been said, the person requesting information must be able to rely on the information's being relevant, up-to-date and exact, as well as on the methods which have been used to produce it and on the forms of analysis employed.
I am not, however, happy about the decision by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy concerning the cost of what the authority can take out.
That is why we have tabled Amendment No 48.
I hope that our British colleagues and other groups will be able to see this as a compromise proposal and that they will also vote for it tomorrow.
Mr President, honourable Members, environmental issues are handled best when all the citizens concerned participate at the relevant level.
This important principle came directly from Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, which places the citizens at the centre of environmental policy.
Without access to environmental information, it is difficult for them to participate, which is why this proposal is so important.
In 1998, the European Community's Member States signed the UN/ECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, known as the Ãrhus Convention.
This convention is a major step forwards in terms of implementing Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and continuing the process of openness initiated by Council Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment.
I personally consider that it is very important that the Community ratify the convention as quickly as possible.
Before this can be done, however, Community law must be adapted to the provisions of the convention, and that is also one of the main purposes of this proposal.
Thanks to the work carried out by the rapporteur - and I should here like to thank Mrs Korhola - and by the European Parliament and the Council, the proposal has been greatly improved in recent months.
Most of the European Parliament's amendments reinstate the amendments not accepted by the Commission at the first reading and designed to strengthen the Commission's proposal.
Although I can understand and respect your desire to maximise the benefit to the public from the proposal, I consider that some of the amendments place Member States under obligations which are unnecessarily heavy and exceed what is required by the Arabs Convention.
The second amendment lays down in great detail the practical provisions for providing information, while the aim of the proposed directive is to provide a framework for the Member States within which they can adapt the provisions to the circumstances in the respective countries.
We consider the Commission's proposal to be well balanced.
It covers the most important commitments under the Ãrhus Convention, and others besides, and gives the Member States sufficient flexibility to be able to implement the legislation effectively.
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 22, 28, 30, 32, 33, 42, 45 and 46 in their entirety.
The Commission can partially accept Amendments Nos 1 part 3, 9 part 1, 27 part 3 and 48 part 2.
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 9 part 2, 19 and 27 part 2 following rewording or restructuring.
The remaining amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission, namely Amendments Nos 1-6, 7 part 1 and part 2, 8, 10-18, 20, 21, 23-26, 27 part 1, 29, 31, 34-41, 43, 44, 47 and 48 with the exception of part 2.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0155/2002) by Mr Lannoye, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the evaluation of the active substances of plant protection products [COM(2001) 444 - C5-0011/2002 - 2002/2015(COS)].
Mr President, I am forced to take a trip eleven years down memory lane since it was, in fact, in 1991 that the Council of Ministers for the Environment adopted a directive, to be discussed this evening, concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market.
The aim of this directive was, firstly, to define a common evaluation procedure of active substances for both existing and new pesticides, and, secondly, to establish a positive list of authorised substances, which are deemed to be acceptable for health and the environment.
A positive list means that any substance that does not feature on this list is, essentially, banned.
Twelve years was chosen as the period in which to complete this considerable undertaking, which of course gives us until July 2003.
In the meantime, however, the Commission was required, under Article 8, to publish a progress report on the procedure.
This report was in fact published at the end of last year and this is what forms the basis of this evening's debate.
In the report, the Commission states that 31 out of the 834 active substances on the market have been evaluated, that is, less than 5%.
In these conditions and as the Commission quite rightly states, it will clearly not be possible to meet the July 2003 deadline.
I shall not dwell on the causes of the enormous delay placed upon us, other than to say that it must be attributed, in the main, to a lack of political will, on the part of the Commission as well as the Member States.
The Member States divided between them the task of carrying out the evaluation of substances.
The Commission is now proposing to extend the deadlines and inevitably, for the sake of realism, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which I am spokesperson this evening, must agree to this extension.
Although it accepts this extension, the group's agreement is, however, subject to strict conditions, which include adopting clear priorities for drawing up the new timeframe for the task, giving priority to substances deemed to cause problems for environmental health and drinking water and refusing to allow any degree of indulgence on this issue. Businesses that do not submit the dossier by the prescribed date shall obviously not have their dossiers evaluated, unless it appears to be easy to fulfil the requirements of the directive.
Lastly, we call for a regular report on the progress made with the evaluation programme to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.
The Commission - and this is what the Committee on the Environment desires - is also due to submit a proposal for the revision of the 1991 Directive before the end of 2003.
Why do we need this particular proposal?
The Commission itself is proposing this, therefore we can only support it and add what I believe to be appropriate comments.
We have noted serious lapses in the process.
In particular, I do not believe it is sufficient to evaluate active pesticides: we must also evaluate metabolites if necessary, in other words, the decay products, which can be more dangerous than the basic substances.
The Committee on the Environment also supports the introduction of comparative assessments and of the substitution principle which will result in encouraging the emergence onto the market and the use of substances with the lowest toxicity; the more toxic substances will therefore be withdrawn.
Furthermore, new criteria - there have been considerable developments in the space of ten years, and even more so in the last two - must be taken into account. These include the lack of evidence relating to endocrine disruption - back in 1991, no one spoke of endocrine disrupters but since then, this has become an important subject in environmental policy - or the specific effect on the health of children and foetuses, as well as the synergistic problems related to exposure to several pesticides.
To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to support the report by the Committee on the Environment, and I should also like to draw your attention to a particular point, namely item 14 of the resolution, which calls on the Commission to publish, before July 2003, a new proposal for a directive establishing a programme for a reduction in the use of pesticides, similar to the one introduced in some Member States.
I feel that the Committee on the Environment is right to support this proposal which aims not only to bring the 1991 Directive to a successful conclusion but also to reduce the use of pesticides, which is certainly a very good way of reducing the risks.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the proposal that is being put to us, the European Commission is asking Parliament and the Council to give our opinion on whether the evaluation period for active substances, which was to be completed by July 2003, should be extended to 2008.
There are 834 substances still to be evaluated.
The Commission is trying to be realistic, and it does of course have our support, but I think that its position is optimistic, as in the previous period less than one hundred substances were analysed.
I am going to highlight the most important points for the Group of the European People's Party: first of all, we must retain the possibility of essential uses, as it could be traumatic for some farms and regions if they were to disappear.
We should retain and support those amendments in that respect.
Secondly, I cannot share the thinking that the substances are harmful in themselves, as it depends on the concentration, the situation, and how they are used.
Our objective should therefore be the smallest risk, which does not mean the smallest quantity.
Thirdly, the preliminary evaluation should under no circumstances be conducted by industries, NGOs, etc., as proposed in an amendment that we do not support, but by those legally established to conduct it.
However, the industries, NGOs, etc. should have access to all the information and can contribute studies and tests to the evaluations.
The new integrated farming policy that is emerging in the European Union has led to a considerable decrease in the use of plant protection products, for example in some farms such as extensive arable farms.
The public has not appreciated this and is not sufficiently aware of it.
The public is increasingly sensitive to the theories of environmentalists, which if they are upheld could lead to undesirable effects on biodiversity due to accumulation as a result of a lack of protection on small farms. This could cause serious problems in terms of lack of supply and dependency and could prevent us from seeking solutions for essential uses and lead us to establish parameters that are beyond the limits determined by analysis or to have plant protection products evaluated by interested NGOs.
Interested in what, and why, I wonder?
Technical evaluations are done by scientists and discussed between scientists.
I would ask the European Commission, the Commissioner and all of the political groups in Parliament to be responsible when voting and to take into account that, without agriculture, sustainable development is not possible.
Perhaps agriculture can exist without sustainable development, but the reverse is not an option.
Mr President, the Commission's report makes it clear that the functioning of Directive 91/414/EEC is full of serious shortcomings.
Consequently, the rapporteur, who, as I have said repeatedly, has done sterling work and receives unqualified support from my group for this, is quite right to criticise a number of those shortcomings in his report.
For example, it transpires that it is not so much inherent characteristics as commercial interests that play a decisive role, that evaluation is limited to certain aspects of hormonal disruption, for example, and that effects on children are barely taken into account.
However, the rapporteur has already been considering all these aspects for some time.
We have to conclude that we have no guarantees whatsoever that substances that feature on the positive list are in fact really safe for the public and the environment.
We hardly have any choice but to go along with extending the evaluation deadlines, because only three percent of the substances have been evaluated to date.
We do this, however, on a number of very specific conditions.
As the rapporteur has elaborated on these extensively, I shall not repeat them here.
However, I do want to take this opportunity to make another point.
The pesticides policy should not only focus on admitting substances regulated by this directive, especially since this directive is unable to stem the continuous increase in the use of, and dependence on, pesticides, and hence the presence of pesticide residues in water and food.
We have a number of important things to do, and I, along with many others, am waiting for the Commission to take the initiative.
There is a wide range of instruments which we need to use at European level.
First of all, the extra financial support for research into, and the application of, non-chemical pesticides must be greatly increased, both for integrated crop management and for organic agriculture.
Secondly, compulsory training in integrated crop management methods and good agricultural practices is essential.
Thirdly, the lack of information requires that a database accessible to the public be set up at European level as a matter of urgency. This database should comprise both sales and user information on all pesticides and their toxicological characteristics.
Fourthly, a VAT level must be set which is harmonised at European level.
It should be harmonised, Commissioner, but at a sufficiently high level.
This currently fluctuates between 23 and 25%, and we need to do something about this.
Furthermore, we need special taxes on external environmental costs related to products and product prices.
And last but not least: reduction programmes must be set up at national level which must curb the use of, and particularly dependence on, pesticides.
Mr President, more than 10 years ago, Directive 91/414 concerning the authorisation, use and control of plant protection products entered into force.
Admittedly, it was clear beforehand that the implementation of this directive would be a complex task, but you will agree with me that the fruits of 10 years of labour are very disappointing.
Indeed, less than four percent of all active ingredients that need to be assessed have fully undergone the procedure.
At this rate, the task will not be completed until the 22nd century.
Furthermore, it appears that a number of important assessment aspects have been overlooked.
The use of additives which boost the effect of plant protection products springs to mind.
For example, agriculture in the Netherlands adds 1 500 tonnes of chemical additives to 3 600 tonnes of pesticides annually, the effect of which on the public and the environment is unknown.
In addition, an assessment criterion for drinking water originating from surface water is lacking.
Practice has shown that the pursuit of the sustainable production of drinking water is hindered by the lack of sustainability in the use of plant protection products.
These are just two examples illustrating that the present Community framework for plant protection products leaves something to be desired.
Given the current state of affairs, we are unfortunately forced to extend the evaluation deadlines for plant protection products.
Only in this way can we get the difficult process of the past 10 years back on track.
I should like to bring three important points to your attention.
First of all, harmful substances must be phased out as soon as possible, with the time when the new period sets in applying as the latest date.
Further delays are, in my view, highly undesirable.
Secondly, we must exercise restraint when granting exemptions.
Thirdly, we must ensure that the conditions we have prescribed for extending the assessment periods are actually observed.
Herein lies an important monitoring role for Parliament.
In short, I call for consistent action when it comes to authorising, using and controlling plant protection products within Europe.
I have to get something off my chest with regard to the Dutch translation of the word 'protection'.
This is sometimes translated into Dutch as 'gewasbescherming' - with good reason, and the interpreters have been using that word repeatedly this evening - but the agenda also mentions 'gewasbestrijdingsmiddelen' on one occasion, which is, of course, the exact opposite of 'gewasbeschermingsmiddelen'.
This mistake often occurs in the Dutch version of the Commission documents, as well as the document by Mr Lannoye, through no fault of his own, of course.
I propose that something be done about this, and that we stop mixing up the terms 'onkruidbestrijding' and 'gewasbescherming'.
Thank you, Mr Blokland, for pointing that out.
Naturally, both the rapporteur and the Presidency services will point out the need for a correction tomorrow, before the vote, to make all the texts the same.
Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for the way in which he has approached this complex issue and his willingness to entertain a wide range of reservations across the Committee and where possible to approach these efficaciously; and also my colleague, Mrs Van Brempt, for her work on this.
I have only time to deal with one specific area, and it does not in any sense detract from my belief that the effective regulation of dangerous pesticides must be a priority task of this Parliament, and, indeed, this Commission.
My reservations lie in the section addressed by Paragraph 13 of Mr Lannoye's report, where we are calling on the Commission to notify us by the end of this year of the measures taken to ensure that useful substances which have low toxicity levels, and appear on Priority Lists 3 and 4, which have not been notified because of a limited commercial interest, or of high evaluation costs, may be so evaluated with the help of an appropriate restricted data package.
Why am I so concerned about this?
I am concerned because there is a danger that some products of high toxicity which have not yet been regulated or properly examined, are still remaining in the market, whilst others, which are of no conceivable danger and are very low on Lists 3 and 4, are going to be taken out of the market because those who produce them, and they do indeed in some cases come into the category of essential uses, are likely to be unable to produce the complex dossier needed to go through all of the processes initially set out in what, as the rapporteur says, has been an extraordinarily slow process.
I just want to give the Committee one example of this: ad hominem arguments are always dangerous, but I have a producer in my own area who turned to a particular plant protection range of products because he was himself alarmed by the effect of dangerous pesticides as he had seen them.
If I talk of things like Agent Orange, you will know exactly what I mean.
Truly harmful substances.
He has produced a product, which I use myself, called Armilatox which is the only effective way of treating plant diseases like Honey Fungus.
There is no way he could pay the estimated cost for the assessment of that product which is in a low toxicity range.
It would be two or three times his annual turnover.
There has to be some way in which we could help people of this kind come up to the standard necessary, or at least present the relevant dossier over the period of time we now have.
If we do not do that, we are flying in the face of all the statements in this House, not least by the rapporteur's party, that we should help small businesses.
We should not just help the big battalions who can, of course, accept all of the high evaluation costs.
If we do not do that in this very important area, we will have failed.
Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this issue here today.
First, I wish to thank both Mr Lannoye and Mr Parish for their efforts in preparing the texts we have in front of us.
I await with considerable interest the final text of the resolution.
My intention in publishing the Commission's report in August last year was twofold.
First, to ensure greater transparency.
Second, to improve understanding of the evaluation process for plant protection products and the problems confronting the Commission in meeting the impossible deadlines under the present directive.
In the present text of the resolution, there are a number of statements and assertions with which the Commission would strongly disagree.
I could provide in due course a comprehensive reply to the resolution after its formal adoption.
As you will all know, although the Commission report focused on our progress to date in the evaluation of active substances, it also has one eye firmly on the future.
We all recognise that all evaluations will not be complete by 2003.
There are many reasons for this, these are dealt with in the report and many of you will be familiar with them.
I would mention in particular, the mismatch between the ambitious targets set in the directive and the resources available to the Commission to deliver on these targets.
This situation requires us to seek agreement on an approach to be taken in July 2003 as regards those substances and there will be several hundred of them where evaluations have yet to be completed.
Although the directive delegated this decision to the Commission through the comitology procedure, we considered that the issue was of sufficient importance to request your agreement on the approach to be taken in relation to these defended substances in 2003.
I share the view that this work should be completed in 2008.
However, I can commit to it only with the provisos that deadlines are respected and sufficient resources are made available by all partners in the process.
We should also be aware that major new scientific issues might arise that would necessitate requests for additional data, thus delaying the decision-making process.
The second point that needs to be highlighted is that the directive is now ten years old.
It clearly needs to be improved.
The preparation of the report has enabled us to reflect on how to effect these improvements without compromising the directive's principles.
There are a number of areas where effectiveness could be improved and where problems that have arisen over the years could be resolved.
Again, I appreciate your feedback in this regard and I envisage coming back with proposals to amend the directive later this year.
To this end, we are organising a stakeholder meeting in Greece in July in preparation for the Greek Presidency and we would welcome both the presence of Mr Lannoye and Mr Parish at those discussions to make sure that Parliament has a voice even in our preparatory work.
Similarly, pesticide residues are an important aspect of this area of work and we intend to bring forward proposals in the coming months to consolidate and amend the basic legislation.
An important point is that the forthcoming proposals will be under the co-decision procedure.
This will allow Parliament a full say in the final content of the legislation which of course I greatly welcome.
Mr President, I recognise that there are many issues we could discuss and there are many points in the texts in front of us with which I could take issue, but I do not want to take up too much time, and I think that these issues would be better discussed when we propose amending the directive.
It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the impact of July 2003 when several hundred substances will be withdrawn from the market.
This will include substances where there are few or even no recognised alternatives.
Member States and farmers insist that this could create serious problems.
The Commission is sensitive to this issue and is working with the Member States to see how such problems could be resolved and minimised without compromising safety.
However, I note that the present text suggests that any authorisations granted for essential uses should have strict conditions attached.
I will be careful to report this view of Parliament to the Member States.
Finally, I recognise that there is some impatience regarding the adoption by the Commission of a communication on sustainable use of pesticides.
This is in the final stages of our internal consultation procedure and will be available in time, I hope, to form part of your summer reading.
To conclude, I appreciate receiving the conclusions of Parliament and look forward to coming to you with proposals for change later in the year.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0170/2002) by Mrs Myller, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision on the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme 2001-2010 [PE-CONS 3618/1/2002 - C5-0171/2002 - 2001/0029(COD)].
Mr President, I would like to express my very warm thanks to everyone who has taken part in drafting and making decisions on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, including the groups' shadow rapporteurs, the members of the Conciliation Committee and the secretariat, and the country holding the Presidency, Spain, and the Commission.
All the above have played a part in the conciliation process achieving an excellent result.
We can be satisfied with this result since the conciliation process saw a very large number of Parliament's amendments accepted and we can be especially satisfied that the amendments which we managed to get through were very important in terms of quality.
All in all it can be said that the Sixth Environment Action Programme is a continuation of the Fifth Action Programme, although it has been criticised because when drafting of the Sixth Action Programme began, insufficient analysis of the Fifth Action programme had been completed as a basis.
In any case the idea first presented in the Fifth Action Programme of integrating environmental policy with other policy areas is also the driving force behind this Sixth Action Programme and it is quite clear that only in this way can we make progress on environmental issues.
All the different policy sectors have to work themselves to achieve the environmental goals.
The environmental goals should of course be set on the basis of environmental considerations, but the responsibility for finding ways in which these goals can be reached should rest with the various sectors.
We recognise that this is not easy.
Today in this House agricultural and fisheries policy was discussed and we noticed that integrating environmental issues with these important matters appears to be very difficult in practice.
The support tools for this programme - for us to ensure that implementation of the programme is heading in the right direction - are thematic strategies.
I am also satisfied that in conjunction with conciliation, agreement was reached on Parliament having full rights to participate in creating these strategies and deciding them and that they should be made sufficiently flexible.
Several important principles were approved in the conciliation process, among which it may be worth mentioning that for the first time we have a decision on European-wide environment taxes.
The Council should now get to work and think about how and in which contexts this matter can be taken further.
Of course, we do, however, have the Seville Summit decision on energy tax, for example.
Another important principle is the fact that we have to finally start to examine the support policy carried out in the Member States and also at EU level.
We cannot in any circumstances damage environmental policy by supporting actions disadvantageous to the environment.
New strength was found to combat climate change and traffic pollution is also increasingly becoming an integral part of this joint effort.
Finally, I would still like to especially highlight the fact that approving policy for the urban environment on the initiative of Parliament as one of the new thematic strategies will pose challenges for all of us because this is a very horizontal question.
We have to be able to find content for this thematic strategy on the urban environment in terms of environmental policy and improving the quality of life of our citizens.
We hope that we will succeed in this.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate all those who have contributed to the programme, and also the Commission - I will explain why presently - and the Council, because in the final conciliation proceedings it clearly made every effort to accept and move closer to Parliament's position.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on the programme that it has drawn up.
I think that it is evident that time has also taught the Commission to work along the right lines.
An environmental action plan should contain broad guidelines, not annexes or specific measures, but rather it should be the main hook on which all future measures should hang.
And in this respect, I think that the Commission has been capable of creating a viable programme that is full of common sense, which gives more authority to the Commission itself and to Europe than an ideal programme full of demands that is impossible to fulfil and implement, which would, therefore, have been unfair.
I must also commend the choice of thematic strategies.
I think that this is a qualitative step forward that heralds a new way of working, in which scientific values are going to be taken into account, a report is going to be drawn up on the status of the issue, the costs and capacity for implementation are going to be assessed and, moreover, there is going to be better knowledge of what is happening in Europe before commencing the measures.
I think that these thematic strategies are a measure that should be extended to many areas.
They will even enable us, for example, to know what the costs are, which is one of the things that there is a demand for: when a policy is defined, for its costs to be defined.
I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the thematic strategies have to be applied to policy on climate change and emissions.
We cannot just have strategies on motor fuels but not on heating.
There is a risk, however, that applying the policies will damage the rural environment; a misunderstood and excessively broad taxation policy for certain products could cause huge damage to those who live far away from the territory and are caring for the countryside and the environment.
I therefore call for a fair and balanced application.
Mr President, tomorrow, my group and, I hope, the entire European Parliament will vote for the Conciliation Committee's proposal for a decision on the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with Mrs Myller as rapporteur, has put a great deal of work into improving the basic proposal from the Commission and making it more specific and has also been successful in her efforts.
I should like to say a big thank-you to Mrs Myller, to all my fellow MEPs and, of course, to the entire Conciliation Committee for having made this work possible.
Clearly, my group would have liked to have seen a possibly more wide-ranging, target-oriented and concrete Environment Action Programme for the next ten years, in other words a real break with the trend in environmental policy and sustainable development.
Now, we have a programme full of declarations of intent, using words such as 'promote', 'seek', 'encourage' and 'aim at'.
If these are not to be empty hopes, more general policy statements must be transformed into concrete proposals which are then given shape and implemented.
We must place our hopes in Environment Commissioner Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and the thematic strategies which are now to be adopted through co-decision.
The programme must stimulate the various players in society to solve environmental problems in an active and responsible manner.
We as legislators, however, have, above all else, responsibility for setting objectives and determining the means of obtaining such development.
Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, at the second reading in January, I commented that there was extensive agreement between the institutions on the programme and I hoped at that time that this would be an indication that the three institutions could quickly come to a final agreement on the programme.
I was not disappointed and I also commended at the time the spirit with which Mrs Myller, as rapporteur, had approached the second reading.
The fact that she focused her amendments with care and precision meant that it was possible to reach a sensible compromise with the Council.
This agreement provides an excellent basis for the Community's environment policy for the next ten years.
The priorities: climate, biodiversity, health, resources and waste.
The approach: a knowledge-based approach, consultation, assessment of costs and benefits - and the means: legislation, market instruments, integration, involving citizens and stakeholders, better implementation of Community law.
It is an action programme.
Perhaps Mrs SchÃ¶rling forgot to mention that there are also 104 different actions that are identified.
It means that it is a programme for all - you can actually check on whether or not we deliver on these actions.
Integration is at the heart of the programme and the programme is at the heart of the Community's sustainable development strategy, which we shall be taking forward with Parliament's support as demonstrated in Strasbourg earlier this month, to the World Summit in Johannesburg after the summer, and from then on of course.
Once again, let me offer my congratulations to Mrs Myller; it is very much thanks to her and all the colleagues in the European Parliament who have worked to bring this proposal to the point of adoption that we now have this new Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
The hard work is, however, only just beginning, especially for the Commission.
I look forward to continuing cooperation between Commission and Parliament in the implementation of this programme.
Next time when we have a formal opportunity, we should bring out the champagne.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0163/2002) by Mr Lange, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the reduction of the level of pollutant emissions from two and three-wheel motor vehicles and amending Directive 97/24/EC [PE-CONS 3615/2002 - C5-0136/2002 - 2000/0136(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday one of the major newspapers reported on the emissions legislation we are due to adopt tomorrow under the headline "Restrictions tightened up".
This legislation certainly takes us a further step towards reducing atmospheric pollutants emitted by internal combustion engines.
The new legislation before us means that by 2006 motorcycles and scooters will be just as clean as a modern car registered in the Euro III category.
It has taken us a long time to reach this stage.
In the past, motorised two-wheel vehicles were somewhat ignored in emissions legislation.
This has led to a situation in which the limit values for these vehicles are several times higher than the limit values for vehicles such as motor cars and heavy goods vehicles.
There is no way we can justify a motorcycle with just one passenger emitting 17 times as much pollution as a motor car with up to four passengers.
So it is both right and necessary that we have also initiated appropriate legislation in this area as well, and I believe that the result we have finally achieved is acceptable.
We have set limit values that cut permissible emissions by an average of 75%.
I believe that is a figure we can all be proud of.
We are to achieve it in two mandatory stages.
We have argued a little bit, but in the end we have agreed on the second mandatory stage, so that by 2006 all newly registered motorcycles and scooters will be able to achieve this considerable reduction.
However, in addition to setting limit values, we have also put in place additional safety nets so that these limit values do not just have an impact at vehicle registration but also genuinely lead to motorcycles and scooters on the road with lower emissions.
We have therefore agreed that from 2006 onwards the devices should continue to operate correctly for at least 30 000 km.
This means that manufacturers must ensure that motorcycles remain clean in practice, on the road.
We further agreed that if there are reasonable grounds for doubt, the authorities can carry out in-service testing of vehicles and type testing to see if there is a mechanical, technical or perhaps maintenance-related fault leading to higher emissions.
And we have also agreed that there should be no scope for cheating, so there can be no electronic cut-off devices.
There are various instances of manufacturers being able to produce fantastic results during the test cycle but with appalling emissions when the vehicles are running outside the test cycle.
That is not acceptable.
So we have agreed on a solid and comprehensive overall package.
This is also evident in the fact that we have somewhat changed the test conditions for type approval.
Up to now, a warm motorcycle was tested at 50 km.
That is of course a long way from real operating conditions.
We have therefore stipulated that measurement must start with a cold motorcycle and must also cover higher speed ranges, and also include an open-road section, because in practice motorcycles are of course scarcely driven at a maximum speed of 50 km.
We also finally agreed on that under the conciliation procedure.
So I think we can justifiably say that we have really put in place a further piece of the history of European air quality. This really is a success story for the European Union, which will mean that Europe's air is a great deal cleaner.
I would like to thank everyone who has cooperated on this.
Mr President, first of all let me express my thanks to the European Parliament and in particular to the rapporteur, Mr Lange, for showing the necessary will to complete the conciliation agreement with the Council on this dossier.
May I also express the wish that one day Mr Lange's report will be taken during the day.
It is now the seventh time that we have begun such a debate at approximately 11.00 p.m. in the evening.
We can be pleased that an agreement on the fuels emission standards applicable to two and three wheel vehicles has been reached.
This will ultimately provide for the introduction of a new dedicated motorcycle test in the 2006 standards as an option at the choice of the manufacturer.
The implementation of this test in the EU will ensure the best possible environmental controls on these vehicles.
We will maintain our efforts to finalise these test cycles on a harmonised basis with other parties as soon as possible.
In this regard, the Commission will make a proposal as soon as possible, and if feasible by the end of this year, to the European Parliament and to the Council to introduce this new dedicated test cycle together with appropriate emission limits that are equivalent to those which are already foreseen for 2006 in this agreement.
At the same time, we will consider when a new dedicated motorcycle test will become the sole test for the user procedure for EU type approval.
Accordingly, the Commission would like make a declaration that has been previously circulated in the institutions and it is as follows: The Commission reaffirms its objective to ensure the best possible environmental protection as laid in Article 95(3) of the Treaty.
Accordingly, its proposal to include the new dedicated test cycle for motorcycles in the 2006 stage as provided for in Article 4(5), the Commission will also consider when this test will become the sole test procedure for the EU type approval.
The Commission takes note of the decision of the of the co-legislators in Article 3a according to which it is requested to present a proposal defining normal life and establishing supplementary provisions.
On this occasion, the Commission recalls that according to its right of initiative in conformity with the Treaty, it is for the Commission to appreciate the timing and the content of any such proposal to be presented.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the joint debate on the oral questions (B5-0019/02) and (B5-0020/02) to the Commission, on the situation in the European shipbuilding sector.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for several years now there have been clear indications that the Republic of Korea has used subsidies in contravention of WTO rules to distort international competition in the shipbuilding sector to a considerable extent and with lasting effects.
In June 2001 the Commission declared that its negotiations with South Korea had failed and recommended to the Council and Parliament to launch a WTO procedure to be accompanied by time-limited protection measures in favour of Europe's shipbuilding sector, which is in great danger.
Parliament voted in favour of this procedure and also recommended including gas tankers in these protection measures.
A study by the Commission is now available on the competitive position for various types of shipbuilding and in particular gas tankers.
This study has now been transmitted to the Council.
I have several questions for the Commissioner regarding this brief summary of the position. Firstly, when will the study be made available to Parliament and to the public?
Secondly, does the study confirm the need to launch a WTO procedure against South Korea?
Thirdly, are there differences of opinion about the study within the Commission?
Fourthly, when will the Commission launch the WTO procedure, and will it continue to provide for the introduction of protection measures for sectors which have suffered damage?
My fifth question is how many jobs have been put at risk in Europe because of this distortion in competition.
Sixth, how many jobs have already been lost because no WTO measures have been introduced over the last two years and no accompanying protection measures have been taken?
My seventh question is how many orders the European shipbuilding industry has lost over the last two years.
My final question, Commissioner, is how you regard the situation and the discussions held by the Council on this subject.
Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen is here with us and the situation in the Council seems to be similar to that in Parliament.
There are great controversies raging in the Member States as to whether the Commission has come up with an appropriate procedure, as on the one hand it is proposing to launch a WTO procedure and on the other it is intending to offset this with protection measures.
The overwhelming majority of this House considered, when we voted on the Riis-JÃžrgensen report, that this was the right approach.
I assume that there will continue to be an overwhelming majority for this in future, but I still wish to ask the Commissioner to give us some information on what measures he proposes, and to explain this to the Council as part of the new discussions now that the study has been transmitted to the Council.
Mr President, I am aware that I am going to repeat what the previous speaker said, because it is the same old story.
Here we are again discussing shipbuilding and the unfair practices of South Korea in the sector.
I have no doubt that while we are here splitting hairs, Korean shipyards will be working at full capacity.
I would also like to point out that this discussion on the unfair practices of this Asian country began in 1998 and so far no action has been taken against the Republic of South Korea, but rather we spend time discussing whether or not it is a good idea to include one category or another in the defence mechanism, which the European Commission designed nearly two years ago.
I do not think I am wrong in saying that at this rate we will end up including pleasure boats.
I would also like to point out that in November 2001 in this House we approved the inclusion of gas carriers, ferries and boats for the transport of motor vehicles, which is part of the complaint to the WTO, but they were not included in the defence mechanism.
Surprisingly, that proposal did not receive the necessary support from the Council, so the whole matter is still on hold, which is truly shameful.
I would like to call for solidarity between the countries of the European Union, the same solidarity on which we have built this community of Europe and which in recent times appears to have faded, because without it, European shipbuilders will soon have disappeared, and we will be accountable to thousands of families.
Mr President, despite the support given by the European Parliament last November and the Commission's expectations for a successful outcome of the discussions in the Council, no decision on the temporary defence mechanism, TDM, was taken at the meeting of industry ministers in December last year.
On the request of European industry, the Commission has launched an update of its Trade Barrier Regulation investigation which has just been concluded.
The Commission took note of the findings of the TBR report at its session on 7 May and authorised its transmission to the Council.
The updated TBR report will be discussed by Member States at the TBR Committee on 29 May.
The updating investigation concludes that the findings of the first investigation as concerns the sectors of container ships and product and chemicals tankers were confirmed, namely that the Korean subsidies in question were causing adverse affects to the EU industry within the meaning of the WTO Subsidies Agreement.
As regards developments in 2001 in the LNG - natural gas carriers - sector, the updated TBR reports stresses the considerable increase in the Korean market shares and concludes that further examination is necessary to determine whether a consistent trend emerges over the longer term.
The Commission will therefore continue to monitor the market.
The Commission's proposal on the temporary defence mechanism on which the European Parliament was consulted in November 2001, is provisionally planned to be discussed again during the next Industry Council meeting which is scheduled for 6 June.
The Commission holds that a joint double response is necessary, that is the WTO complaint and the temporary defence mechanism.
Furthermore, the Commission welcomes the common position agreed by OECD members in Paris to launch fresh discussions on a new agreement on shipbuilding involving major non-OECD shipbuilding nations.
The Commission considers that these are important steps towards addressing the problems raised by the Korean practices, both in connection with the TBR case and temporary defence mechanism and, in the long-term, the OECD agreement.
It therefore intends to actively participate in these discussions and carefully evaluate developments.
There were also other detailed questions, I can transmit some replies in the form of our annual report and after having discussed with my colleagues who are working with this file, Mr Lamy and Mr Monti.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, exactly one year ago, on 14 May 2001, the Council authorised the Commission to launch a WTO dispute resolution procedure in order to prevent unfair competitive practices by the Republic of Korea.
Not only has there been no improvement since then, if anything the disparity has become even greater.
International competition is still being grossly distorted by South Korea's price dumping, meaning a further loss of world market share for the European Union.
There is a danger that these structural imbalances will become even more marked.
For example, South Korea's shipyards are making enormous efforts to get orders for certain types of ship, such as cruise ships, which up to now have been Europe's domain.
These continuing problems are putting a strain on a sector of European industry that has had to cope with a difficult adaptation process in recent years.
That applies both to capacity reduction and to the need to step up quality and productivity in the remaining yards.
The regional impact of this structural change has been and continues to be at its most severe in the peripheral regions.
If the very existence of Europe's shipbuilding industry is not to be jeopardised, the protection measures proposed by the Commission for the duration of the dispute resolution procedure are vital.
That is why it is important for the Council to approve time-limited protection measures of this kind immediately.
Furthermore, the procedures for levying anti-dumping and countervailing duties need to be consistently applied in accordance with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Up to now, threats have had no discernible effect on South Korea's behaviour.
It is now time for clear-cut action!
Mr President, there is of course one matter we keep coming back to.
It is the same alliance every time, and that does not improve matters.
There seems to be no doubt at all that the South Koreans are granting state subsidies which contravene WTO rules.
However, there is considerable disagreement as to what should be done about this.
The Commission is solely responsible for initiating a WTO procedure against South Korea. In spite of unambiguous requests from the Council and the European Parliament, the Commission, together with Commissioner Lamy as the person responsible for this area, have, however, so far shown an impressive ability to ignore these requests.
For quite incomprehensible reasons, Mr Lamy refuses to initiate a WTO procedure unless, at the same time, state subsidies for European shipyards are introduced; or, to put it another way, Mr Lamy will only try to have the South Korean practice deemed unlawful if Europe itself introduces an unlawful practice.
As I see it, we in Europe would only damage our own case through such an approach.
Hopefully, you, Mr Liikanen, can, however, explain the wisdom of this position, though I doubt it.
As rapporteur last autumn, I did a lot of work to stop this link from being made, and I am still doing so.
State subsidies have never been of benefit to anything at all and are expensive for the Member States.
As, incidentally, I also did in a still unanswered letter I wrote together with my fellow MEP, Mrs Kauppi, from Finland, I would most strongly urge Commissioner Lamy to initiate a WTO procedure against South Korea straight away.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party makes the same proposal in Amendment No 3.
In Danish shipyards, employees have already begun to be fired on the grounds that it is no longer possible to compete with the huge state subsidies paid by the Koreans.
This is therefore a very important matter, especially for the area in which I was elected, and I would urge that a WTO procedure be initiated.
With reference to the issue of unemployment, I would refer to the ELDR Group's Amendment No 4.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening, giving an opinion that I share, a fellow Member described the proposal for the common fisheries policy put forward by Commissioner Fischler as cutting off your head to get rid of a migraine.
Fisheries and shipbuilding, which are so closely linked, are matters of deep concern in many Member States, in regions of the European Union such as Galicia and in cities such as mine, Vigo, where shipbuilding and fishing are the source of employment and means of living for many families.
In December 2000, a report from Parliament set out the threats to shipbuilding in Europe: crisis in the fisheries sector, flags of convenience in the merchant navy and the risks of ships registered in a Community country being built outside of Europe.
This is all because we are incapable of standing up to a situation of unfair competition in the face of a reality of disloyalty and dumping, while we wait for the Commission and the Council to adopt courageous and firm decisions of great political significance.
I think that the naval sector accepts and desires the European Union's objectives: streamlining of the shipbuilding industry, an increase in productivity, an increase in the competitiveness of shipyards, improving the environment, which are objectives that can be achieved in a situation of transparency and equality, but not with the disadvantage of dumping and unfair competition.
We therefore ask for a link to be established between the temporary defence mechanism and the decisions adopted by the WTO on measures undertaken by the Community against Korea, and therefore we also ask for the protection mechanism to be extended to sectors of the market such as gas carriers, ferries and roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) vessels, as the complaint made to the WTO also includes them, as well as container ships, oil and chemical tankers and natural gas tankers.
To conclude: the Regulation should be adopted before it is too late and the shipyards have closed down because nothing can be done.
What is worse is that if the European Union does not support shipbuilding through temporary investment, it may be giving an invitation to those who practise dumping and unfair competition to extend those practices to other sectors of the economy, such as the automotive industry and electronics.
Both possibilities go against the transparency and freedom of competition that Europe and the European people want.
Commissioner, let us not be too late.
The migraine will disappear because we will have lost our heads.
Mr President, it really is very late now!
I confess that I am tired, but not too tired to fight for jobs in Europe's shipbuilding industry.
Over the next few days the whole world - or at least its football fans - will be focussing on Japan and South Korea.
However, in view of the shipbuilding situation I would rather avert my gaze from the Far East.
The background remains the same - dumping prices in the Korean shipyards.
The distortion in competition already described and recently confirmed in a Community report is becoming worse because of the ending of subsidies in Europe.
As a consequence, more and more maritime companies are closing down and the many job losses associated with this mean only one thing: the European shipbuilding industry is fighting for its life!
What are we in Europe doing?
That is what I am constantly asked as a Member for a coastal area.
I feel like telling the people affected that Parliament has done its homework but that the other two key players are neglecting their responsibilities.
Let me mention a few points to illustrate why I am so angry. We are now discussing our third resolution in this House and we gave our agreement to time-limited protection measures a long time ago.
And yet support for our shipyards has still not been given the go-ahead.
Why?
Because the Council has still not reached agreement and the Commission unfortunately still has to take into consideration types of ship that are already covered by the WTO complaint.
That is why I would like to clearly restate the key points of our common policy here in Parliament.
We urgently need to take action at Community level.
This needs to be taken immediately, in the form of a WTO complaint, and, as we have heard, the Council is meeting next week in any case. This Community action needs to go hand in hand with temporary support for Europe's shipyards.
Failing that, we will find ourselves playing football without a full defence, at the risk of labouring the footballing analogy.
The wheels of the complaint procedure turn very slowly, but meanwhile Europe's shipbuilding sector is dying.
We should not underestimate the declaratory effect of a WTO complaint, but at the same time we need to have powerful and immediate measures in reserve.
The resolution before you clearly calls for both these things, so that I expect the cross-party amendment to receive broad support in tomorrow's vote.
Thank you Commissioner.
I have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, the Minutes wrongly state that, following the report on, and description of, the attack on Mrs KlaÃ, I had simply called on the President to take disciplinary steps.
Although true, that is only half the truth.
In addition, I publicly called on him to lay charges before the responsible law enforcement agencies against the employees of this House who made themselves liable to criminal proceedings for failing to give assistance when Mrs KlaÃ was attacked.
I request that the Minutes be amended accordingly.
Mr Mombaur, I myself witnessed both Mrs KlaÃ's joinder of issue and your own.
I do indeed recall that you raised this point about the failure to provide assistance.
I can inform you and the House that the Bureau considered this case yesterday and that there will be a written report, which will lay bare all the matters connected with it.
I therefore request my small staff here to add to the Minutes - page 17 in the German version - what Mr Mombaur said about this matter of the failure to provide assistance.
(Parliament approved the Minutes of the previous sitting.)
The next item is the report (A5-0162/2002) by Mr HervÃ© Novelli on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a Council Regulation (COM(2001) 423 - C5-0438/2001 - 2001/0172(CNS)) on State aid to the coal industry.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal to the Council of 25 July 2001 on State aid to the coal industry has a certain number of good qualities and one slight defect.
The first of the good qualities is the fact that it is essential.
The second is that it really is an important step in the right direction for the coal industry.
The slight defect is that it contains a certain number of inaccuracies which have not been removed at the committee stage.
This proposal is essential because the previous arrangements will expire in July 2002, hence the need for a new regulation.
Above all, it is essential because of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, which is the legal basis of the previous arrangements governing aid to the coal industry.
The restructuring of the coal industry in Europe has not been entirely completed, so there can be no question of not having a new regulation on these arrangements for State aid.
This proposal is also a step in the right direction insofar as it makes provision for production aid to cease in 2007.
In fact, I believe that it is inevitable and desirable to make provision for the cessation of this aid, since coal and steel products will be re-integrated into the common law of the Treaty on European Union following the expiry of the ECSC Treaty.
My attention and the discussions in committee were concentrated on the revision, from my point of view, of this text, an important revision, because it consists of supporting the creation of what is known as an 'indigenous primary energy base' in order to preserve the European Union's independence regarding this product.
This creation is slightly surprising in a text which originally had only a technical purpose.
In any case, it calls, and has called, for the following comments from me and from a certain number of other Members. Is Europe threatened if this indigenous primary energy base is not created?
Is there any strategic interest in creating such a base? In other words, is coal strategic, and is indigenous coal production within certain limits strategic to the European Union?
My reply to these two questions is negative.
I believe, and the experts agree with me, that the world coal market is characterised by both great dispersion of supply and great stability of prices in the medium and long-term.
The risk of shortages is quite small.
In addition, there are a number of products which could claim strategic status, and therefore the replies obtained from the Commission have led me, I regret to say, to propose that this revision be stated separately in this text in order to deal with this problem.
The period of validity of this regulation is set to end in 2010.
I had proposed that it should end in 2007, for the sake of consistency, because that was the year, in the Commission proposal, for ending production aid.
I regret to say that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did not agree with me, and my report was rejected.
That being the case, I invite you to vote for this report on the original version of the Commission proposal because, despite its uncertainties, inaccuracies and obscurities, the proposed regulation is a step in the right direction, towards support for the restructuring of the coal industry, albeit for a limited period of time.
I believe that this is how that support should be given, because it cannot continue indefinitely.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the proposal for a regulation, which the Commission submitted almost a year ago now, is a good and reasonable compromise between the conflicting interests that there have been in the Commission and in the Member States.
What shows that it is not such a bad compromise is the fact that these conflicting interests and views were also, of course, present in Parliament and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and our agreeing, the second time around, to support this very Commission proposal, which is nearly a year old, says something about the proposal.
We - by which I mean my group - will in any case, when we eventually come to vote, be supporting it without amendment, and we will keep to what we agreed in committee.
That notwithstanding, whereas Mr Novelli made a few critical comments from his standpoint, I do so, of course, from my own, for any agreement on the details does not indeed prevent us from having outlooks that differ overall.
If the translation is accurate, Mr Novelli, you twice spoke in terms of the Commission proposal envisaging the cessation of production subsidies in 2007.
That is not actually the case; rather, production subsidies are to continue until 2010.
That is right and proper.
Closure aid is to come to an end in 2007.
I do, though, have a small problem with that, in that, in view of our desire for a strategic base of this sort and, of course in retrospect, the need for capacity to be adjusted as well, I can very well imagine that we will also need aid for closure and reconstruction, especially if it is maintained that this base, too, has to be underpinned by laws on the grant of aid.
No single Member State, no matter which one, can do as it pleases about this, but it must, both before and after 2010, be monitored by the Commission in accordance with the laws on subsidies.
I have a few difficulties with the phasing out of aid as well.
It is indeed the case that they have to be marked down on a sliding scale.
What the Commission is proposing appears to me to be a bit too mechanical.
On this point, I would recommend to the Council that they should just think a bit about whether they can refer back to what the ECJ decided when they ruled on the subject in 1998.
My last point has to do with the clause about the post-2007 assessment, which was mentioned in the proposal.
We should think again about that as well; otherwise, our approval of the Commission proposal is unconditional.
Mr President, the Novelli report on the coal industry in the European Union was, as you are aware, rejected by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on 23 April.
That report, far from helping to reach a consensus around the European Commission proposal, which was viewed by the majority of the members of our committee as balanced and comprehensive, meant sudden death for the European coal industry.
On the one hand it meant cutting aid to companies in the sector, and reducing the periods within which our industry could receive that assistance.
Given the importance of the issue, particularly for the families and regions that depend solely on that activity in the European Union, the majority of the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy came to an agreement on a fair and balanced consensus text that is none other than the draft regulation from the European Commission.
That regulation envisages maintaining aid to that sector at least until December 2007.
During that period the European Commission will evaluate the development of the sector, both at Community level and at world level, and if necessary will put forward fresh proposals.
On the other hand, it should also be remembered that this date is in some way subordinate to the security of energy supply that the European Union needs, as this is a factor that the European Commission will undoubtedly take into account when formulating new proposals.
We think that this is an important subject that should be treated as a priority.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Novelli's original report was rejected because when voting on the amendments we realised that the final text was completely incoherent.
On the one hand it had incorporated the positions of those who wished to remove aid to this industry, which is fundamental for energy supply and for social cohesion in our countries, while on the other hand others among us would have liked to go further and have greater certainty about what is going to happen after 2010.
For this reason, the report was rejected in committee and as the chair I was given the task of conducting the necessary negotiations to solve the problem, because we would have been unable to deliver an opinion on the Council's decision.
This was why I contacted Mr Novelli, as he had already worked on this report, and also, out of parliamentary courtesy, I thought it was appropriate to consult him as to whether he wanted to put forward the only text that could receive a consensus, which was the Commission's text, and Mr Novelli agreed, which I thank him for.


He thinks it is a step in the right direction, as do I. He thinks that it goes too far and I do not think that it goes far enough but it is, however, the only possible text, and we therefore think that we should give it majority support and comply with the agreement between the different groups, which is not to adopt any amendments modifying the Commission's text.
Now the ball will be in the Council's court and we hope that it will adopt a solution that is in line with the Commission's proposal.
Mr President, as I have only one minute I shall be very brief.
The Greens are in favour of restructuring aid because we have an obligation to support restructuring in coal-producing areas so as to provide future prospects for the workers and their families living there.
By contrast, we are categorically opposed to providing aid in order to ensure security of supply, because there is a world energy market which is liquid, where prices have not changed for the last twenty years, and where the countries of origin, the United States, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, are stable.
It is ridiculous to give millions of euros to subsidise European coal, which is three, five, ten times more expensive, as long as the world market is liquid.
If we were to pursue this economic policy in other areas, I believe that that would amount to a return to nationalism and it would mean the end of world trade if each continent were to pursue policies of this kind.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, coal will continue to play an important role in energy provision for the foreseeable future.
On that point I am at one with the Commission, even though the relative amount of energy produced from coal has become very small in comparison with other primary energy sources.
I even think that the Commission should have made even more emphatic reference to hitherto unused capacity to derive energy from coal, as greater effectiveness can be achieved through improved technical procedures, especially combined heat and power.
If we - as is indeed only right - include indigenous primary energy sources and thus also coal in the European strategy for security of energy supply, this inevitably leads, in the case of coal, to the requirement that the Member States should have the right to grant aid in this sector, as Community coal production is made uncompetitive by geological conditions and environmental and social standards in the EU.
This means that the classes of aid proposed by the Commission - operating aid, closure aid and help with meeting inherited liabilities - are sensible and necessary, although there might very well be different opinions about the period for which this regulation is to run.
What I find regrettable about the Commission proposal, in view of the imminent enlargement of the European Union, is that it does not include the coal-producing acceding countries in its scope with effect from the date they join, which is indispensable, and the periods for which the regulation is to run are far too short for these countries to be able to carry out the necessary and painful restructuring of coal mining in, for example, Poland and the Czech Republic.
Poland, in any case, produces more coal than the whole of the European Union put together, totalling 102 million tonnes in 2000 over against the EU's 85 million tonnes.
There is a need to catch up here.
My group supports the Commission proposal.
Mr President, the Commission has made a proposal, and Parliament has no amendments to put forward.
Those Member States that want to apply coal subsidies have to decide on this themselves and take responsibility for it, even bearing in mind that the subsidies are very high, and that the money involved could perhaps have been used to promote other, forward-looking, industries.
The European Union is being asked only because it has to rule on the compatibility of these subsidies with the European market.
A qualified majority in the Council is required for that, Madam Vice-President - and it is you personally that I am addressing, if you would be graciously pleased to listen to me.
It must not appear as if an essentially superfluous unanimity in the Council is being concocted, as is currently being attempted through an unparalleled deception after the example of the fraudulent Conference of Nice.
It is not on for manifestly illegal subsidies by other Member States to be sanctioned by means of a unanimous resolution, with, for example, French, Italian and Dutch subsidies to freight carriers being declared not to be detrimental to the common market.
That adds up, per annum and per lorry, to a subsidy of EUR 7 000 to the benefit of freight carriers in some countries and to the detriment of those in all the others.
That such a thing can be unanimously sanctioned in the Council, thus contravening the European Treaties, is a scandal!
Madam Vice-President, a policy of that sort flagrantly violates the Treaties, and does so with consequences that are incalculable.
I note that the conditions specified in the Treaties for such permission to be granted, even unanimously, are not fulfilled, and I call upon the Commission to contest these fraudulent outcomes of Council meetings in the European Court of Justice and, if possible, to put a stop to them.
Mr President, this has not been an easy report for the committee to handle but there are two points which I believe need to be addressed by the Council when it is reaching its final decision.
First, the concept of viability in the industry should be strengthened.
Productivity improvements should be demonstrated where financial aid is made available.
The second point is that because of low world prices, developing reserves in existing coalmines is very often difficult to finance and this accelerates the closure programme.
Support for such developments should be included in the provisions.
I would also like to associate myself with remarks made by Mr Markov.
Mr President, I live in a very small region called Asturias, which has suffered from various restructuring processes in recent years, in particular that of the mining industry, which we are discussing today.
In recent years our number of miners has dropped from twenty-four thousand to around eight thousand.
I therefore share the desire expressed by my colleagues the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, and Mr Rapkay, that we should adopt the Commission's proposal, for various reasons.
First of all because it guarantees aid until 2010 and gives us some time.
Secondly, because it also talks about CO2 emissions, and rightly points out that, with the decrease in coal production CO2 emissions associated with its use have decreased, and because it states that, with the current directives on emissions, industries are obliged to ensure that their new processing plants make a more serious effort to prevent pollution and use the latest techniques available.
The Commission also highlights the social and regional consequences, and no one here can forget them.
I think that each of us is aware that in Germany, Asturias, LeÃ³n (our neighbouring Autonomous Community) the same thing is happening and we know what happens when miners' families and the whole industry surrounding them are left without work.
The Commission therefore also highlights the need to maintain regional cohesion.
And we need to take into account, Mr President, that the most recent agreement, for example in Spain, between the government and the unions, extended decreases in production.
I would like to finish, Mr President, by saying that the only concern we have about the Commission's proposal is regarding what will happen after 2010.
Mr President, the end of the treaty means that something must be put in place.
Otherwise, an abrupt end of support would cause a chaotic situation.
However, it should not be a licence for endless subsidy.
The UK experience shows that it is possible to have a competitive industry, but that the adjustment process can be tough and painful.
Deadlines are necessary to force action.
I would prefer a shorter deadline, but I respect the compromise we reached in the committee to support the Commission proposal.
We must recognise the importance of coal to the EU energy supply and I want to emphasise the aspect of security of supply.
We are, in Europe, already heavily dependent on imports of coal, and therefore there is a case to maintain some domestic production.
Coal represents 16% of our final energy supply in Europe.
I believe that our subsidies, however, should be directed more at clean coal technology for greater efficiency and lower emissions.
I welcome the recognition of the United Kingdom coal industry's achievement in improving competitiveness and I would like to close with the thought of challenging the logic of subsidising production of coal at around EUR 140 a tonne on the one hand, while on the other hand phasing out much more economically efficient nuclear production.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I would first like to thank the European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Novelli, and the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, for the work that they have done in this area, and in particular for their favourable report on the proposal for a Council regulation on State aid to the coal industry.
I am aware that this has been a complex issue, but as has been demonstrated today in the discussion, I think that in the end, as Mr Westendorp rightly said, the text that we put forward was the only one on which there could be this consensus and that could give us a way out and a solution in the face of a Treaty that is expiring.
As Mr Novelli said, it is an innovation.
It is true that to some extent it is an innovation when we move from a guarantee offered by a specific Treaty to an internal Regulation as part of the general rules.
In any case, I hope and trust that the Council will now be able to reach a political agreement at the Energy Council on 7 June, and I hope following the vote, with the support of this House, and that, with the Council meeting we will conclude the procedure for adopting this Regulation.
The Commission's proposal is based on the discussions in the Green Paper on a European strategy for energy security and supply, and it is true that it is not a question here of whether or not we are under threat.
I think that what we have to consider is whether we are more or less vulnerable, whether we are more or less secure, because I think that this is the concept that we need to have in mind.
And being under threat is not exactly the same thing as being more vulnerable.
Frankly, and this is why I have put forward this proposal, I think that it is precisely by maintaining strategic coal reserves that we can be more secure and less vulnerable to certain crisis situations.
We have very vulnerable points along the entire energy supply chain.
And I think that after 11 September we need to consider that although the risks are very remote, they do unfortunately exist and we cannot ignore them.
In recent years the European Commission has been putting forward proposals in order to increase the contribution of renewable energy sources, mainly within indigenous primary energy sources.
Those proposals mean increasing our security of supply.
In this sense it is important that the Member States that have coal resources should have a Community framework that enables them to continue to maintain access to them and to maintain minimum production to guarantee that access, within the focus on supply security, to minimum indigenous primary energy sources.
Ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the amendments tabled by Mr Turmes, the Commission does not feel that the proposal to withdraw references to the contribution of coal and renewable energy sources and the creation of a base of indigenous primary energy sources is in line with the principles of consolidating supply security and for that reason we cannot accept them.
We wish to stress that, when dealing with issues associated with energy and the environment, the Commission's focus is an overall one that takes into account all the issues associated with energy sources and their use.
With regard to the amendment stating that the aim of the new regulation is to incorporate coal products into Community law, the Commission considers that coal products will become a de facto part of the scope of application of the EC Treaty once the ECSC Treaty expires.
We do not therefore consider this amendment to be necessary.
We understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission's proposal is what I would even describe as harsh due to the requirement of continuing with the restructuring of the industry by closing the production units that do not contribute to the plan to safeguard coal resources and due to the reinforcement of the principles of progressive reduction and transparency in the granting of State aid.
However I think that this is what can and should be put forward at this time.
We also think that it is consistent with the three pillars of the principle of sustainable development: security of supply, economic rationality and social and regional cohesion.
A moment ago we were hearing from someone with very direct knowledge of a region such as Asturias, about how we are faced with these issues.
In terms of the environment, it envisages promoting cleaner technology.
Finally, our proposal, which I hope will be favourably viewed by the European Parliament today, takes into account the dimension of the enlargement of the European Union, as some of you have said.
Poland and the Czech Republic need to continue with the restructuring process that has been underway for more than a decade and with this proposal we are giving them a framework in which to carry out those changes.

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I would like to thank you most sincerely for everything you have said, even those who were more critical, and I think that this is a balanced text, which I understand leaves a little to be desired for some and a lot for others, but I think that it is what can and should be put forward at present in order to maintain stability and a clear framework of relations in this key sector for some European regions particularly, but also for enlargement and for security of energy supply.
Thank you, Commissioner De Palacio.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Mr President, could I begin by saying that the difficulties which face us in the consideration of this report represent some of the most important challenges to the completion of the internal market.
Ever since the publication of the TENs progress report at the Cardiff Council meeting of 1998, there has been concern that some Member States have not succeeded in bringing forward projects which are appropriate for the type of funding contained.
Therefore, as rapporteur, I have endeavoured to undertake a balanced approach to the revision of the TENs guidelines across the transport modes which facilitate our collective goal of a common market.
So that we can develop a network which best fits the needs of business and the consumer, I feel it is necessary to offer a breadth of choice that will encourage competition, both within a particular sector and across all modes.
I am particularly happy to see the increased importance given to regional airports in this report, which will not only provide valuable flexibility in the air travel market, but also significantly reduce congestion around our principal capital airports, along with the concomitant problems which that causes to the economy and the environment.
Similarly, I am also pleased to see, in areas where such action is appropriate, there is a greater emphasis on short sea, intra-European and inland waterway shipping.
However, it is necessary that in our efforts to promote a variety of transport modes, we do not lose sight of the different economic and social needs of Member States.
A one-size-fits-all approach will not work.
Different countries have different conditions to deal with demographically, geographically and economically and I must confess to being opposed to some parts of the report as passed in committee, which seem to favour unduly certain modes at the expense of others.
If a particular form of transport proves to be the most effective option for their particular requirements, European citizens should not be deprived of their natural choice by actions which have little relevance to their specific circumstances.
For example, in my own constituency of the West Midlands in the United Kingdom, which forms the core of my country's logistics, distribution and haulage network, we are fortunate enough to have two TENs projects running through the region: the West Coast mainline railway and the M6 motorway which links together large parts of the British motorway system.
It seems to me, by way of example, to be ridiculous to have the direct competition of these two transport modes compromised when this offers genuine choice to the consumer.
The concept of genuine multi-modality proposed by the Commission should be encouraged, to include such projects as road and rail links to airports, but in a form which does not distort the market.
Also, I have concerns that rail transport alone will not be financially or economically feasible in some areas of the Union.
Thus, I fear that too prescriptive legislation will needlessly discriminate against some Member States.
I feel that the plenary amendments which I have submitted amount to a restoration of fair competition and flexibility which will allow Member States to use the available funding for the most appropriate form of transport to meet their particular circumstances.
I believe that EU funding should be restricted to a series of technologically and economically feasible projects from across all modes of transport, which will represent a truly level playing field.
Sadly, one of the characteristics which does seem to be common in these projects is the tendency for them to drag on without recourse to reassessment if Member States do not provide the wherewithal to implement them.
The regional policy transport and tourism committee has already accepted an amendment to limit the period for any project to no more than 15 years and I would commend this to the House.
I cannot emphasise enough that in order to secure the long-term viability of the transeuropean networks, it is imperative that we first ensure the sound management and financial probity of suitable projects.
Similarly, I have not been able to support amendments tabled to add further projects to Annex 3 in the light of past experience which, in a sense, has resulted in an auction of promises.
It is illogical to spread funding even more thinly when projects are already not keeping to the targets originally agreed.
For this same reason, I am proud to say that I have been uncompromising in my position with regard to the financial scrutiny that I feel Parliament has a duty to perform.
For example, with regard to the Galileo system, the definitive cost of which has only been approximated, I propose that a regular cost-benefit analysis be undertaken and that Parliament be informed of progress of the project on a regular basis.
To conclude, I reiterate my belief that a balanced approach to transport across the EU is what is needed, not one aimed at current fashion.
This is a very long-term, highly costly programme and Europe's peoples will not thank us if we go down the path of denying them the choice and freedom of transport that they rightly expect.
I hope the House will feel able to support this report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think the Environment Committee has produced a very fine opinion on Mr Bradbourn's report.
The ladies and gentlemen in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are, alas, not as ecologically aware as their colleagues in the Environment Committee, but, after all, one has a bit less of a grasp of things one does not spend that much of one's time dealing with.
We are, however, of one mind when it comes to being ready to promote the development of transport links with the countries bordering on the EU and between the EU's Member States, which I consider to be most important in terms of the enlargement of the European Union.
Yet the Environment Committee has scored one major success in that the Transport Committee now accepts that the results of the strategic environmental impact assessments should be binding on the actual processes of implementation.
Only on the connection between health issues and transport issues are they evidently unwilling to think more deeply.
It is the case in all the Member States that transport accidents, above all road traffic accidents, are a major cause of death and serious injury.
Air transport contributes significantly to air pollution.
A considerable number of people in Europe are exposed to levels of traffic noise which are not only a serious nuisance and a cause of disturbed sleep, but also lead to communication problems and, in children, even to genuinely serious mental disturbance.
We are keen to discuss all this in depth, but there was a lack of willingness to take the Environment Committee's opinion that seriously on these points.
Good things take time, though, and there will no doubt be another opportunity for the Environment Committee to have its say on transport issues.
Certainly, nothing in human affairs can be seen only in black and white, and we all know that a very great part of our freedom and our prosperity is tied up with transport - be it by air, on the roads or on rail - but we should be responsible in all that we do.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur, who has done very sound work, as usual.
We agree with the gist of what he is saying, although my approach does differ from that of the rapporteur and that of the European Commission on a number of important points.
It is unfortunate that in the framework of the TENs, the Commission is opting for the same approach as the White Paper: lots of trains, not much water.
The rigid management of European trains makes rail transport as a solution to the congestion in goods transport less likely than we would like to think and hope.
Development of the waterways is cheap in terms of investment, and unsurpassed as a solution to the problem of congestion.
I, along with a few other MEPs, wanted to make this point and add a few specific, cross-border water projects.
The strategy of the two large parties in this Parliament does not allow for this.
Although I have been unable to see the point of this strategy to date, I have reconciled myself to it.
If the three institutions had all decided against adding any projects, this would have been a logical step.
It would have been much preferable not to review the annex in its entirety until 2004, by which time the acceding countries could have been taken into account to a greater extent.
At the moment, only Parliament, which has nevertheless fought for the right of codecision on this score, will exercise restraint.
This will result in a list that is a little one-sided from a geographical point of view.
Fortunately, a few amendments, tabled together with the Liberals and the EDD, have been adopted by the groups.
They call for alertness on all fronts concerning transport by water as a reasonably cheap solution to congestion.
Furthermore, I am of the opinion that it would have been far better for the Gallileo project to be financed from research funds instead of infrastructural funds.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like, first of all, to thank our rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, who has taken a great deal of trouble to come up with a report which now seems to me to be perfectly acceptable.
Naturally we are pleased that the new guidelines being proposed to us for the TENs are moving towards and are in line with the policy of sustainable mobility which was proposed to us in the White Paper.
I believe that this cohesion was absolutely necessary and I consider, personally, that the new objectives which have been proposed to us are probably sustainable objectives which will go beyond the other re-focussing phases of these projects.
We also warmly welcome the six new major specific projects, in particular Galileo. We in this Parliament approved this project with a large majority, and we have seen what an impact it has had.
I also warmly welcome, on my own account, the links through the Pyrenees, because it cannot be repeated too often that the Pyrenees pose a problem which is just as acute as the one posed by the Alps.
However, this report raises two series of problems.
The first problem concerns the definition procedure of Annex III.
How can we avoid Parliament becoming a sort of auction of a certain number of local and regional projects, without any budgetary responsibility, which would eventually lead to Parliament being discredited, because of course we all have our favourite projects in our own regions, and in our own towns and villages?
Moreover, how can we ensure that these projects are not snatched away and removed from the free will of those who represent the people, in other words Parliament?
I do not think that we have settled this question properly, and we shall have to think about it in terms of procedure.
For our part, we have decided to support, on a provisional basis, the Annex III proposed by the Commission, but I wish to make it quite clear that I do not consider it to be satisfactory.
The second problem is that of funding.
I believe, Commissioner, that it will be necessary to take a very strong initiative on the question of funding the TENs.
In a way we are parading, at European level, a responsibility and an option without resources.
When you look at the work that has been carried out, this is not satisfactory.
I personally believe that, in addition to the proposals that you will be making to us on the system of charging for the use of the infrastructure, perhaps you could also include the idea of a large loan to finance the TENs and to accelerate their implementation.
If you were to launch such an initiative, there are a number of us who would support it.
In his sterling report, the rapporteur once again underlines the importance of TENs.
It is therefore beyond me why the European Parliament should not be a party to deciding on this list of priority projects.
Parliament demanded this at the time of the initial decision in 1996; it now has this opportunity and it is not seizing it.
The Commission backed Parliament in 1996, and we are now about to turn down this opportunity, as is happening in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Mr President, this is beyond me.
This is also unacceptable, in my view.
This is why my group, with the support of a number of members of other groups, has re-submitted the projects that were turned down in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - both my projects and those of other fellow MEPs, who have had to withdraw their reports on account of some pressure or other.
