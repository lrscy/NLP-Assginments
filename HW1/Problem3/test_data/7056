We are slowly beginning to understand that you can only achieve that with healthy people. However, the low income countries of our world also need their own Lisbon agenda, and they need healthy people too.
Malnutrition means disease and disability. Disease means a reduced and ever less-productive workforce.
That means poverty; and poverty means the inability to counter disease and hunger. That is the vicious circle that we have to break.
That is what the Millenium Development Goals set out to do. That is what the World Food Summit set out to achieve.
That is what the Declaration on Action Against Hunger and Poverty, once again, has declared. Even my own report in the ACP set it out yet again.
We have 30 years of resolutions and 30 years of failure.
The key is not food aid but food security.
The former for emergencies, but the latter for long-term survival. The key is removing barriers to the imports of produce from low-income countries.
The key is to ensure that our rightful concern with the tsunami-affected countries does not strip Africa of crucial aid. The key is to stress to President Bush - while he is here, in Europe - as well as to other Member States that aid is not an opportunity to reduce First World agricultural surpluses, but that he should buy local with aid money.
If you cannot buy local, buy regional.
The key is to reinvest debt repayments in indebted nations to meet those millenium goals for hunger and disease.
Only then can we give real hope to the 800Â million of our fellow human beings who are undernourished. Then we will meet those food production targets, not globally but specifically in high-debt, low-income countries.
That is what this motion sets out to achieve.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the role the new Member States of the European Union play in the achievement of development cooperation.
I am delighted that a number of the new Member States have recently made significant increases in the budgetary funds they have earmarked for development policy.
Yet the people of these countries know very little about development cooperation. Many people believe that aid consists exclusively of humanitarian aid.
The noble impulses of the heart and peopleâs generosity whenever there are natural or humanitarian disasters are commendable, but it is important for people to understand that the elimination of extreme poverty and hunger is a strategic goal.
I think that it would be worth alerting the citizens of the new Member States to the fact that the poverty that occurs in European countries is a different type of poverty to that which occurs in the poorest countries of the world.
It is true that Poland is home to five million families who have to survive on the equivalent of EUR 2.5 per person per day, but EURÂ 2.5 in Poland is significantly more than EUR 2.5 in the poorest countries of the world.
This is the case because the vast majority of men and women in Poland have access to water, electricity, gas, roads, education, health services and welfare. The difference between the technical and social infrastructure in the new EU Member States and in the poorest countries is much greater than it generally seems.
Raising awareness of development cooperation in the new Member States is a task of such importance that not only the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, but also the governments of the Member States should commit themselves to accomplishing this task to the best of their abilities. I know that Commissioner Michel is aware of this issue.
Poland is the country where immensely positive changes in the economic, political and social spheres came about as a result of the Solidarity movement and the implementation of the idea of solidarity, which began 25 years ago. Lech WaÅÄsa always said that people needed fishing poles, not just fish.
At the same time as fighting hunger and extreme poverty throughout the world, we should never forget that local opportunities must be created, as well as providing emergency aid. This would enable those living in the poorest countries of the world to help themselves, and we would avoid the phenomenon described by researchers as the âmodernisation of dependenceâ.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has made it clear that in order to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, we need a significant increase in ODA â official development assistance, which I would, in fact, prefer to call âfunding for official development cooperationâ.



I think it is also important to congratulate those countries which are fulfilling the target of spending 0.7% of GDP on development cooperation.
We should also congratulate countries such as Belgium, Finland, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, which have pledged to achieve this target by 2013.

I myself come from a Member State that is not high-ranking in this respect.
Austria and Italy are at the bottom of the league table as far as ODA is concerned.
That is the reason for my question to the European Commission and the Council: what specific forms of cooperation and monitoring are envisaged so that the countries at the bottom of the table and the middle-rankers catch up with the front-runners, thus ensuring that enough public funding is available to deliver Europe's contribution to fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Chairman of the Committee on Development and I, in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on International Trade, have tabled the previous question on hunger and this one jointly. We wish to draw attention to a new situation that has arisen, bringing with it a dramatic change in the pattern of world trade.
I refer to the end of the transitional period for the ATC Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.
This was a period of ten years, after which quotas would cease to exist, which was what happened on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005.
A new situation has therefore arisen.
MrsÂ Morgantini referred to a Copernican change in at least 59Â counties that had quotas with the European Union. This has resulted in a redistribution of world trade, with implications for employment and economic activity the world over, not only as regards the European Union or the United States, but also within the European Union itself.
The textile and clothing industry is constantly restructuring.
There is at least one factory of this kind in every constituency represented by Members of this House.
In total, there are over 100Â 000 small and medium-sized enterprises in this sector, employing more than two million people.
A major transitional policy must therefore be considered, and I am sorry CommissionerÂ Mandelson is not in the House today. The Commissioner happens to be in Beijing, and I must emphasise that there are a number of reasons why serious discussions with our Chinese colleagues and partners are called for in the Doha Round.
China cannot simply retain 50% of the world market.
China is the lead country in terms of ownership of US Treasury Bonds, a major financial power, a technological power and a Member of the Security Council. Consequently, as far as trade is concerned, China is also bound to abide by the principles of respect for intellectual property, competitiveness and trade as laid down by the WTO.
This is one of the issues that must be discussed with China.
The House needs to be informed of the measures the Commission intends to propose, following the meeting of the High Level Group on textiles and clothing, in order to ensure an ordered transition within this key sector.

Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I can be brief.
My colleague from the Council has already said everything the Commission would say.
â I would, nevertheless, like to say a few words. The WTO Agreement is of course a very important one, and it expired on 31 December.
The task now is to see how we can cushion the predictable impacts. Mr Schmit has already responded to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo by outlining the measures presented by the Commission and adopted by the Council.
Let me say again: it is extremely important to adopt measures to step up the fight against fakes and piracy, to enforce intellectual property rights, to establish an action plan in response to the existing trade barriers in third countries, to promote high-tech and ultra high-quality textiles and clothing, including via the EU's research and development programmes, and to guarantee lifelong learning and vocational training and development.
He also mentioned the monitoring procedure and the imports of textiles and clothing into China. I would just say that Commissioner Mandelson, who is actually responsible for this portfolio, is now on his way to China to discuss all these issues, and others.
The protection measures outlined by Mr Schmit are a last resort. Indeed, they can only be implemented if the legal conditions comply with WTO rules.
We must also consider how trade developments in this area will impact on the highly vulnerable textile and clothing sector.



It has already been mentioned that the Commission and the WTO are carefully monitoring China's progress in implementing its WTO commitments and are utilising the opportunities available to us.

For those countries affected by the liberalisation of textile quotas, the best option would be to adopt measures to improve the range of goods they offer.
We are prepared to assist these countries as they adopt these measures.
For the ACP states, for example, a study is now being prepared which reviews the response strategy of those countries which are heavily dependent on exports of textiles and clothing. The European Investment Bank could also offer services here, such as an investment facility.
That is one option which I throw open for discussion.
I will then answer questions on this issue.
Â Â  . Mr President, as you know, thanks to a particularly aggressive dumping policy, and the reduction of prices to an improbable 70%, which is lower than the price for raw materials, China has already seized one-third of the quota-free textile imports in Europe.
If nothing is done about this, the European market, now fully open, will be flooded with cheap textiles from China, but also from India and Pakistan.
I very much doubt, Commissioner, that the Commissionâs action plan of 13 October 2004 will be enough to help the European textile industry in its fight for survival.
The plan provides for support measures, but does not contain any trade-related measures at all.
It was envisaged that textile imports into Europe would be monitored from 1 January onwards, which would allow the Commission to take action swiftly if necessary, but Commissioner Mandelson acknowledged last week in the Committee on International Trade that this monitoring system is still not operational and criteria have not even been laid down.
When will this, at long last, be done? When it is too late to lock the stable door, and the horse has already bolted?
Might I urge the Commission to use all possible means to combat unfair commercial practices in some countries?
The Commission has the means at its disposal, including a horizontal safeguard clause, a textile-specific safeguard clause which, according to the Multi-Fibre Agreement, is permitted under certain circumstances, or in extreme circumstances, it can lodge a complaint to the WTOâs dispute settlement body.
In short, Commissioner, what we expect from the Commission is a more trade-minded and more pro-active approach.
We must be bold enough to hold up our fist to major trading partners, certainly if they compete with us unfairly. It is unacceptable to leave 177Â 000 companies and 2.7 million workers in the European textile sector out in the cold.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, now that the quantitative import controls for the textile and clothing industry have been abolished, there is great concern about the future of the textile and clothing industry in the EU. It is worth putting this into an historical perspective.
InÂ 1962, as a young economics student, I wrote an essay on the marked decline of the Swedish textile and clothing industry after the Second World War. At that time, the reason for this was the stiff competition from low-wage countries such as Germany and Italy.
I found that structural change in the sector had been successful.
Labour had moved to better paid jobs in the engineering industry, and what remained of the textile and clothing industry had moved on to more advanced products.
No unemployment had resulted, and the trade unions had played an active part in the structural change. The whole episode stood out as a tale with a happy ending from both an economic and a social point of view.
This process continued during the 1960s and 1970s.
At that time, the surviving Swedish textile and clothing enterprises moved a large proportion of their production to low-wage countries such as Finland and, in time, Portugal, but kept their design and marketing operations in Sweden.
Special products such as menâs suits and car upholstery continued to be made in Sweden, and were profitable. Nowadays, the thought of Finland â âNokialandâ â now so advanced, still being considered a low-wage country in the late 1960s is laughable.
Today, very little remains of Swedish textile and clothing production, but large Swedish clothing chains employ large numbers of people in designing and marketing clothing worldwide.
We have had ten years to adapt.
For the EU to become a leading, dynamic, knowledge-based region, its socioeconomic system must succeed in compensating for a decline in the textile and clothing industry by means of a transition to more sophisticated textile and clothing products and strong growth in other sectors.
If it does not, the Lisbon agenda will show itself to have been a soap bubble waiting to burst.
Â Â  . Mr President, representatives of the Commission and the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today all the concerns already raised during the parliamentary debate in January 2004 are being voiced again, but above all the emphasis is on the inadequacy of the measures recommended by the Prodi Commission with regard to the crisis in the textile and clothing sector, which have already been weighing down industry in this sector for some years, causing the loss of thousands of jobs. We only have to cast our minds back to the unwillingness to address the issue with specific programmes.
We hope that there will now be other guidelines.
The High Level Group and the Commission have proposed seven actions to help the textile industry boost competitiveness in the sector: they are all important, but I would give particular emphasis to one of these. In Europe we have labour legislation with especially strong worker protection which vastly inflates the cost of goods.
We cannot tolerate unfair competition from certain non-EU countries based precisely on extremely low labour costs and in particular, the exploitation of child labour. Along with the call to tighten corporate social responsibility, we will have to make the public more aware of ethical purchases, through special campaigns.
To this end, labelling which allows consumers to easily identify goods manufactured in accordance with the fundamental labour rights specified by the International Labour Organisation is vital in order for buyers to take responsibility too.

Together with actions in the fight against counterfeiting, I would highlight the suggestion to take action to support traditional textiles with focused programmes, not least so that we can avoid further official approval of textile goods, which is certainly of little use in the context of celebrating regional identities.
Â Â  Mr President, our textile and clothing industry is in bad shape. Since the end of the 1980s, French companies have been making workers redundant or closing down altogether, and more and more businesses are relocating to low-wage countries.
Since the 1960s, the textile and clothing sector in France has lost two-thirds of its workforce, which is about 20Â 000Â jobs per year, and today we are suffering 2Â 000Â job losses a month.
In my own region of Nord-Pas-de-Calais, historically an important textile-producing area, towns such as Elesmes, Roubaix and Tourcoing have witnessed the closure of their businesses.
The social situation is already serious and yet it is going to get worse in future.
Until now, quotas have made it possible to limit imports of textiles from third countries, but on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005 the door was opened to imports on a massive scale from China.
France and Europe now need to define a strategy to defend their textile industry.
We must as a matter of urgency request the WTO to provide safeguard clauses. Indeed, this option is available to Member States if a sudden increase in imports is observed, to the major detriment of a local industry, and this is indeed the case in France and Europe today.
Since the quotas expired on 1Â January, imports have soared, and the flood from China is destroying whole sections of what remains of our textile industry.
Imports of trousers made in China between 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005 and 2Â FebruaryÂ 2005 increased by 792% compared to the same period in 2004. Imports of pullovers increased by 613%.
Before it is too late, and regardless of the opinion of Guillaume Sarkozy, President of the French textile industry union and a fierce advocate for the delocalisation of businesses, we must not wait to see our internal market flooded before we demand a return to customs barriers and safeguard clauses.
The extremist advocates of liberalisation who drafted ArticleÂ 314 of the Constitutional Treaty, announcing the opening of our borders to world trade and the lowering of customs barriers, are promising us major general industrial and social decline, of which the textiles issue is an unpleasant foretaste.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, my fellow Members have pointed out several times that the textile industry used to provide more than two and a half million jobs, and I myself come from a region, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais in France, that knows all about this, because it is currently suffering greatly from this loss of jobs.

These figures show how necessary it is to put in place a strategy that can help the textile and clothing industry to cope with changes connected with the disappearance of quotas.
We currently have only incomplete data, but even what we do have is alarming.
According to declarations made by Chinese importers, imports of many categories of textile products into Europe have doubled, or even trebled, since quotas ended on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2005.
It is vital for the EU to have trade policy instruments that enable it to respond to sudden variations in imports.
In that regard, Commissioner, it has become a matter of urgency for the Commission to publish guidelines regarding the textiles-specific safeguard clause for China announced in OctoberÂ 2004, in the absence of which industries throughout the Member States will be unable to respond. The EU respects its commitments within the WTO.
These commitments must now be respected by all members of that organisation. The textile and clothing market must remain open and competitive.
The European Union also needs to realise that many textile-producing countries regarded as vulnerable are also at risk of being seriously affected by the lifting of quotas.
I am thinking of Bangladesh, Cambodia and our Mediterranean neighbours.
It was almost ten years ago that the European Union decided to enter into a partnership promoting development in the Euro-Mediterranean region. The question of textiles therefore points more than ever to the need to establish a real free-trade area as soon as we can.
Â Â  Mr President, my fellow Members have already pointed out that the consequences of lifting the quotas has been immediate, and the threat facing the European textile and clothing industry is indeed a real one. By way of example, I would also like to refer my own region, which has been seriously affected by the decline of the textile industry.
The district of Castres-Mazamet acquired its industrial nature from the wool pulling and leather industry.
For many years now, the SMEs in this sector have been closing down one after another.
Some of them have been able to switch to other fields, thanks to skills developed in international trade, industrial technology and the development of new products.
But do we have the right to write off those who want to ply their trade in textiles and clothing?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, do we not have a duty to protect the European textile and clothing industry?
Pending implementation of the High Level Group's recommendations, on which Parliament will state its position, the European Union has defined a strategy for coping with changes resulting from the end of quotas, which translates, it would seem, into specific commitments: producing a draft protocol on the rules of origin, adopting guidelines regarding the textiles-specific safeguard clause for China, putting in place the Community preference system, the likely establishment of a 10% threshold with the aim of preserving the market share of traditional providers of the EU, negotiating at the WTO in order to obtain substantial concessions from emerging countries that maintain high tariffs, as well as erecting non-customs barriers in the textiles and clothing sector and, finally, adopting strategic plans at local level to improve the allocation of public funds.
I have in mind in particular funds from the flexibility reserve within the framework of the structural funds and of the 'regional competitiveness and employment' Objective.
Within what timeframe and following what timetable are you planning to apply these specific measures?
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the Textile High Level Group contains indications for seven different measures to bolster competitiveness in the sector.
The group also recommended that a system should be set up to monitor Chinese imports from 1Â January 2005.
Unfortunately, however, the same group was unable to issue guidelines on the mark of origin because of internal differences of opinion.
Today, in fact, there was an article in a major Italian daily by Commissioner Mandelson about the âMade in Italyâ mark, according to which the Union has a duty to inform consumers so that they can distinguish a shirt produced in China from one made in Italy.
I agree, and I would add that strict labelling rules fulfil that duty. Therefore, with regard to the system to monitor Chinese imports, first of all I would like to know what the results of monitoring have been in the almost two months since the restrictions were removed.
Secondly, regarding labelling of origin, I would ask the Commission and then the Council whether they intend to adopt measures soon that will make it compulsory to label goods with their origin, and I would point out that such a measure is strongly demanded by textile manufacturers in Italy and elsewhere.
Â Â  Mr President, the upheaval experienced by the global textile and clothing industry has hit those regions in Europe where textile production is heavily concentrated particularly hard.
This is the case for my region in France, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais, which has already been affected, over recent years, by restructuring and delocalisation and where this sector is the second-largest industrial employer, still providing work for more than 30Â 000Â employees.
In 2004, Parliament, in a resolution, and the High Level Group on textiles and clothing both called for a specific programme for this sector, in particular in regions in difficulty, which have a large number of SMEs and a high employment rate among women.
In these regions, European aid has made it possible in recent years to mitigate the socio-economic impact of sectoral crises, to avoid job losses and to cushion the effects of economic restructuring thanks, in particular, to innovation, integration, training and the development of a modern industry.
At a time when the European Union is drafting its new financial perspectives, these regions are concerned about the future of the structural funds, which have contributed to economic development.
I am sure that the Commission and the Council will be keen to reassure them and to prove to them that the economic and social cohesion to which these funds contribute is one of the European Union's priorities.
Â Â  The debate is closed.


Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0009/2005).
We shall be taking a series of questions to the Council.
Â Â  . I do not have much to add. We are indeed in contact with the Croatian Government.
They are fully aware of the need to cooperate with the Tribunal, and, as I have already said, we have never claimed that the arrest was a precondition, since, if the gentleman to whom you referred is in hiding, which does seem to be the case, it follows that it is impossible to provide any assurances.
This does not alter the fact that the Croatian Government must make every effort to cooperate as effectively as possible with the Tribunal. It is on the basis of this cooperation that the assessments will be made.
Â Â  . I do not have much to add on this subject either; it is the Council that will make the decision.

That said, I can only reiterate that cooperation with the Tribunal is a vital element.
The Israeli nuclear physicist, Mordechai Vanunu, was released by the Israeli authorities in April 2004 after eighteen years in prison, eleven and a half of which were spent in solitary confinement.
Unfortunately, since the day he was released, Mr Vanunu has been held hostage by his country's government.
He has been deprived of the right to travel and of freedom of speech.
Recently, in November, he was re-arrested by the police on totally unfounded charges. Does the Council intend to make any recommendation to the government of Israel to restore the democratic rights of this person who has been persecuted to excess?


Â Â  . Yes, I will.
Â Â  . At its meeting on 31Â JanuaryÂ 2005, the Council adopted an action plan providing for measures that are currently being drawn up. In the action plan, the Council invited the Commission and the Secretary-General and High Representative to present appropriate proposals, within their own fields of competence, on the creation of a European Union rapid response capability enabling us to deal with future disasters.
The Secretary-General has agreed to present his proposals to the Council as soon as possible and by 31Â MarchÂ 2005 at the latest.
One of the key priorities of the Luxembourgish Presidency of the EU is the Lisbon Strategy.
Results in implementing the Strategy have so far been disappointing, since both the productivity and the competitiveness indicators in the EU have lagged behind US indicators and those of some Asian countries.
Does the Council intend to help effect the transition from a general programmatic text to a coherent and integrated development strategy?
How does it intend to address the problem of the excessively large number of objectives and priorities, the lack of internal cohesion between the objectives and means to attain them, the lack of effective implementation mechanisms and the need for interconnection between economic development, social cohesion and environmental sustainability?
Â Â  â I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply. However, as you know, the communication from the Commission and from Mr Barroso about the objectives for the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy caused tremendous reaction and concern, because he told us that he has three sons and he will only look after the sick one, which is competitiveness.
The other two, the environment and cohesion, will be pushed to one side.
Is the Council in a position to assure us that policies for cohesion and the environment will not be demoted and that the resources will be secured to service these policies?
Â Â  I think it is very clearly specified â and this, I repeat, has been said by the President of the European Council â that the Lisbon strategy is a coherent whole, comprising a pillar that might be described as competitiveness or the economic pillar, a social pillar and an environmental pillar.
The great challenge is to demonstrate that these three pillars are not mutually exclusive but form a truly unified entity.
The Presidency will endeavour to ensure that full account is taken of the coherence of these pillars when the new strategy is being defined.
Greek farmers are protesting at the fact that 'ceilings' are being imposed on cotton by area of land and weight, even though this is a product in which demand outstrips production in the EU.
It is worth asking why European taxpayers' money no longer goes to the most hard-working group of Europeans, namely farmers, but instead to markets outside the borders of the 25 Member States.
The device of 'ceilings' will wipe out farmers in the regions, in precisely the same way as the policy of large multinational conglomerates is removing SMEs from European ownership.
Why are these 'ceilings' not abolished, so that the EU can become self-sufficient in agricultural products in which demand outstrips production, enabling European farmers to enjoy a larger income? Is the Council examining the possibility of abolishing these 'ceilings' for cotton and other products in which there is a shortfall in the EU
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to ask the Council whether, when they talk of encouraging imports from less developed countries, they also take into consideration factors such as worker protection in those countries, in terms of both social security and, above all, working hours and conditions, and whether they also take environmental protection into account, so as to avoid adverse effects on the environment as well as adverse effects on our economy caused by producers who do not comply with the strict standards to which we have to adhere.
Â Â  President-in-Office of the Council, it is a sad fact that many of those who will try to take advantage of the tragic situation in the tsunami countries will be European citizens.
Will the Council look at creating a Europe-wide register of child sex offenders outside the territory of the European Union, so as to ensure that every Member State is aware of the activities of these individuals and to ensure that we have a common EU approach to dealing with them when they return to European soil?

Â Â  I have no doubt that it would be useful to identify the framework within which the mechanisms for combating these phenomena in Europe could be strengthened, perhaps even on a European scale, and to find ways of improving cooperation with the relevant countries with a view to prosecuting the perpetrators of such acts.
Does the Council have any plans to address the anomaly of European tax havens?
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my question to you has to do with tax competition, which, in my view, is now a given in Europe, and an integral element of the internal market.
One of the major problems we face is that small and medium-sized enterprises often lose sight of which tax regulations apply to them.
As regards value added tax, for example, we have more than 100 different regulations.
Will any initiatives now be launched in order to make taxation more transparent for the layman?
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, I am grateful to Robert Evans for tabling this question.
I am interested in whether you believe that the existence of tax havens makes it more difficult to track down and freeze the funds of organisations that are considered terrorist organisations; and also whether their existence makes it more difficult, for example, for the world's poorer countries, to access money that may well have been siphoned off by some of the less reputable regimes for the benefit of those in power.

Will the Council ensure that the justified action that it is taking to assist victims of the Tsunami is not undertaken at the expense of aid to Africa?
Â Â  Thank you, President-in-Office, for that very encouraging reply. I am sure you will agree with me that it would be tragic if Africa â which faces a tsunami week in, week out in a less visible way through the ravages of famine, its climate and diseases such as Aids - were to lose money as a result of our justified generosity towards the victims of the tsunami.
I would like to ask, before your time is up as President-in-Office, if you would ask the Commission to report and show that Africa is still receiving as much money this year as it would have received if the tsunami had never happened?
Â Â  I believe that the various conclusions adopted by the Council all refer to monitoring and evaluation.
The Commission is required to render accounts, but the funds earmarked for Africa in the various frameworks, particularly that of the Cotonou Agreement, are reserved funds.
This means that it is not possible to draw on these resources to finance other activities, such as those relating to the tsunami disaster.
I believe there are enough guarantees to preclude any transfer of funds.
Having said that, I recognise the need to ensure that future funding cannot be reduced because of the special effort â entirely commendable though it is â made by the European Union and the Member States to help the countries stricken by the disaster; I also recognise the need to ensure that none of this has any adverse effect on Africa, which, as you so rightly said, faces a tsunami of its own on an almost daily basis.

Â Â  â The fact is that what we have here is not, of course, an isolated case.
There is, in fact, a wide range of areas in which the limits set by the European Convention on Human Rights, which makes a number of demands in terms of data protection, are being substantially exceeded. As the questioner puts it, it is of course the ultimate crime, moreover, to use this information contrary to the interests of suspects.
The mere fact of storing the information, however, constitutes an infringement of the requirements under ArticleÂ 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
We may therefore expect the Council to adopt a basic position on these problems without wrapping them up in waffle about matters being taken into consideration.
This is a most fundamental issue.
Â Â  When all is said and done, I can only repeat that this issue is being discussed from the very angle indicated by the honourable Member and that no final decision has been taken.
I believe there is a very real concern to safeguard privacy and to comply with ArticleÂ 8 of the Human Rights Convention, and full account will undoubtedly be taken of this concern when the provision is re-examined.

Â Â  Questions 10 to 40 will be answered in writing.(1)



Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0027/2005) by Mrs Bresso, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC and European Parliament and Council Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC and European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 0000/2004 (âUnfair Commercial Practices Directiveâ).

Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am pleased to inform you that overall, we are satisfied with the report adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. I can assure you, Mrs Bresso, that we will once again be giving the package of amendments, all nineteen of them, our full backing.
We have all been working on unfair commercial practices for a while and as progress was made, starting with the Green Paper up to second reading now, we have become increasingly aware of the need to allow the internal market to be not only an area in which the free movement of goods and services simply occurs, but also to turn it into an area in which this free movement occurs in the knowledge that all is done in accordance with fair practices.
It is, of course, not the case that so far, or as long as this directive is not in force, everything would have been done unfairly. The Member States assumed their responsibilities at a time that was appropriate to them in the past, but we have noticed that, for as long as those Member States organise that protection differently in each country, we will have a problem within the internal market, namely that this market lacks the confidence of the unassured consumers who dare not look across the border, or the confidence of the enterprises, mainly the smallest enterprises, that hardly dare take a step across the border because they too are unfamiliar with the rules on the other side of it.
I think that the work we have done collectively is sound.
It is a very balanced document because it offers a high level of consumer protection, as the treaty expects from us, but it also provides maximum legal certainty for the trader, which means that we can strike a perfect balance. We are also for the first time taking a careful step towards full harmonisation.
I think we can do this because the level of consumer protection is so high.
This is all thanks to perfect cooperation with Members from other groups, the Council and Commission. I should like to thank all those involved, because it is thanks to this openness, transparency, constructive attitude that we have achieved so much and that we are able to complete the dossier at second reading.
Mrs Bresso, I would, of course, like to thank you, in particular, for your commitment.
Although this proposal only deals with âB to Câ, that is, âbusiness to consumerâ relations, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is nevertheless pleased with the fact that this legislative document explicitly mentions that when an entrepreneur establishes that a competitor contravenes this directive, that that can be used by that entrepreneur to turn it into a case of unfair commercial practices, a case of distortion of competition, albeit in accordance with the national law of the country in question.
We are also satisfied that we have, at long last, managed to establish among ourselves who the reference consumer is, that we take the average consumer as a point of reference but that we do this without losing sight of the weak consumer.
I think that in that area too, we have struck a particularly good balance.
All that remains for us to do is to hope that the Council will set to work promptly to give the initiative its official stamp of approval and that the Member States will not hesitate to ensure that everything is transposed into national legislation within the prescribed timeframe.
Â Â  .
Mr President, tomorrow our Group will be voting in favour of all the amendments. I must thank the rapporteur for her hard work in bringing this consensus together, especially taking over the report as she did.
It has been a wonderful example of all the institutions working together at the second reading to get a good result.
It seems to me that this is an important and innovative proposal, giving us a very high level of consumer protection, and harmonisation of that protection, across the EU, in a comprehensible and coherent way.
That is to be welcomed. It is also innovative in that, as a framework directive, it is combined with the use of codes of conduct.
That is a good step forward. I hope, and it seems from what has been said here already tonight, that we will all be able to give this proposal a fair wind.
On behalf of our Group, I want to make two further, more specific, points.
As others have said, there are still concerns about the definition of vulnerable consumers.
I know, for instance, that in some of the Nordic Member States and, indeed, in the EEA states for whom this legislation will have relevance, there are higher levels of protection already in existence.
There are worries about how this will be affected in the future.
I believe that the Commission, during the transition period, should give some consideration to these concerns.
I want to turn to one of the particular unfair commercial practices that is dealt with in the Annex and is the subject of an amendment that we will vote on tomorrow. It is a particular practice in my own country that has reached epidemic proportions.
I refer to the telephone scams, where people are phoned â again and again, evening after evening â told that they have won a prize and invited to phone another number, which, if they do, they will run up an horrendous and huge telephone bill.
We will, at last, have the ammunition to deal with that when this legislation comes into force across the European Union.
I believe there are many other good things in this proposal that commends itself to us all in the House, and I hope it and our rapporteur get the support they deserve tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to add my support for agreement at second reading on this very important directive.
I also want to thank Mrs Bresso for leading that negotiating process, together with all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular my colleague, MrsÂ Thyssen, who led for our side on this.
This proposal, as many Members have already said, will be very good for consumers.
It will also be very good for thousands of businesses that want to trade fairly and provide high standards, because those companies are in many cases outraged when they see fraudsters perpetrating scams on unsuspecting consumers.
They want them dealt with as much as anybody else.
Unfortunately, ingenious tricksters keep finding ways to take money off unsuspecting consumers.
It is interesting that since we started work on this we have already added a number of new provisions to this annex. One of the things we must have â and this is addressed to the Commission â is a mechanism to keep absolutely on top of this.
We must also ensure that we keep adding to the blacklist when we find that people are finding ways around the rules.
We want consumers to have confidence that they can exercise their rights in the internal market.
That leads me to the second point: as we are clearly going to approve this overwhelmingly tomorrow, it is now important to tell the Commissioner that we want to see this transposed as quickly and effectively as possible. Under its 'better regulation' proposals, the Commission has new mechanisms to coordinate and push through transposition as quickly as possible.
We expect the Commission to do that and also to put pressure on those Member States that, perhaps, are not quite as vigilant as they should be or are not supporting the consumer protection bodies with the resources required.
A part of our overall work in this committee is to support consumers.
It is an important flanking measure to other things we are working on.
I must also say, in conclusion, that it is an essential foundation for what I know will be a very successful directive on the internal market for services, which I am confident this House will adopt very soon.

Â Â  Mr President, I am happy to follow Mr Harbour in that same spirit which characterised the committee.
The tone was set from the outset by the rapporteur, and her energies and skills as a new Member of this Parliament were quite exceptional, particularly since in the last few weeks she has been crossing the Alps more often than Hannibal, with other activities in her own country also.
I want to pay tribute to all those who brought this about under the Treaty provisions for consumer protection, which had not been used very frequently up to now.
Everyone has to agree to a conclusion like this and any one person can wreck it.
All of those who have spoken in the debate today have been contributors, both by withholding the negative power to destroy and joining the other institutions; the Luxembourg presidency and the Commission, and indeed the staff of our own committee, the Internal Market Committee, a new committee, to whom I would pay particular tribute, so that we brought about the right result here.
It extends the internal market; we should not forget that, because it produces more assured consumers.
And it produces them because they are protected; because the special character of vulnerable consumers is acknowledged in this legislation; because there is a clear guarantee that high existing standards of consumer protection will not be imperilled and that over the next five years we move to higher standards for those that do not yet have them, and not lower standards for those who do; because the blacklist in the annexes here is clear, comprehensive and unambiguous.
The consumer knows where she or he stands.
So does the honest and legitimate businessman; and so does the cold-caller with the lottery scam; the rip-off timeshare artist; the peddler of mock sales.
If you sail under false colours this directive will sink you. I can think of nothing better guaranteed to enhance the image of this institution as a people's parliament for the public good than legislation like this.
It opens the way for further developments, including, in time, more sophisticated use of self-regulation by a stable industry, and for the position of children, the one social category who are, by definition, vulnerable.
To those of our colleagues who felt that, in these fields, we did not go far enough, I would say that we have a foundation of security which harmonisation at the highest level can now proceed.
We have helped our citizens, Mr President.
We have provided an object lesson for our colleagues. It is not a bad start for this new committee and for this new Parliament and Commission.
I thank you all.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent work. It is not always easy to be a consumer in present-day society.
The volume of advertising has increased enormously and it has become very diverse. In the course of their daily lives, consumers constantly have to make decisions on the basis of the very conflicting information they receive.
Sometimes advertising can be misleading for the consumer, and marketing can be aggressive and unfair. Legislation to regulate this varies from one country to another.
For that reason, we need common legal instruments that will guarantee high levels of consumer protection everywhere in the countries of the EU.
I think it is wrong to suppose that consumers have the opportunity or time to examine advertising material very carefully.
The average consumer will only skim through it.
We ought to pay special attention to advertising which is aimed particularly at children, who are more vulnerable to the effects of marketing.
Harmonisation must not lower standards of consumer protection, which in some EU countries are very high.
Consumer policy should be based on guaranteeing high levels of consumer protection.
For that reason, I hope that we will get and apparently we will the transition period that has been proposed for this directive. This is a good thing.
The Member States need to be given time to reform their national laws in order to maintain high standards of consumer protection.
MrÂ President, the country-of-origin principle is not being applied, and should not be applied, in this directive. If the authorities in the country of origin were deprived of the opportunity to take issue, if necessary, with unfair advertising, the most crucial objectives contained in this proposal for a directive could not be achieved.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in the congratulations addressed to Mrs Bresso.
To be sure, it is no easy matter to take over such a brief in mid-stream, and, while carrying on with what MrsÂ Ghilardotti had begun, you have added your own emphases, and I have to say I admire the way you have been able to hold your own in the trialogue, a place where predatory beasts dwell.
We did not always agree about everything, but I would like to stress at the very outset that I am very glad that you have succeeded in keeping this directive flexible in its application.
The eastward enlargement has of course given us a much more heterogeneous range of consumers, as well as far more diverse ways of doing business, and I am glad that that has been taken into account by allowance being made for local circumstances in the interpretation of the directive in individual cases.
This, though, also means that it is important that Article 4 should provide that the Member States may not restrict the free movement of services and goods on the grounds of unfair trade practices.
As I understand it, this also means that a decision taken in one Member State on the legitimacy of a business practice cannot be questioned in another. I think this comment is an important point of reference for the courts who will have to interpret this in future.
I am glad to see, Commissioner Kyprianou, that you have given pride of place in your work programme to the transposition of European rules and regulations.
This directive is one where putting good thinking and ideas into practice will be difficult.

The internal market is meant to be one for fair competition between upright and honourable business people, and by means of this directive we are ensuring that this it what it becomes.

Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too shall begin by congratulating both the rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, and the shadow rapporteur for our group, Mrs Thyssen, on the excellent work they have done and the sensitivity, astuteness and sense of balance with which they have done it.
It is their work that has enabled Parliament to put forward its positions on this subject, which is so important to consumers, and at the same time has saved us the delays and uncertainties of a conciliation procedure.
This represents an important moment in the internal market and the first landmark in this area during this parliamentary term.
Parliament has here a very important contribution in terms of key points, and all those who often underestimate our legislative work will be proved wrong.
During the previous term, it was because of Parliament that the common position after first reading included the following points: the notions of vulnerable consumer and binding commitment; greater procedural rigour in drawing up codes of conduct, including the participation of consumer associations; a more precise and comprehensive listing of aggressive and, as such, banned practices; the derogation clause, now extended to six years, to permit the interim application of more stringent national legislation; and the obligation on the Commission to report regularly to Parliament on the implementation of the directive and to propose updates when necessary.

Returning to the astuteness of the rapporteur and those who conducted and closely followed the interinstitutional proceedings, the second reading will also enable us to go a little further with consumer guarantees and protection, particularly in the area of child protection, outlawing the unfair exploitation of children through a number of duly considered and polished amendments, for which the final agreement of the Council is already assured.
Good news, then, and complete success. I also made a modest contribution to some of these amendments, especially Amendment 17, and I should like to thank my fellow Members for all their understanding in accepting it and following it through, because I am aware that I tabled it only just within the time limit allowed by the Rules of Procedure for second reading.
However, it is one more consumer guarantee that has been put in writing â in this particular case, in the area of insurance â and that is clearly a positive outcome.
Just a final point, MrÂ President, to say that I share the rapporteurâs view that it is unnecessary and might even be inappropriate to insist here on the so-called country-of-origin principle or, in this case, the internal market clause.
I am also one of those who believe that we should be moving towards the harmonisation of legislation in these areas, and that is what has been achieved here, which is a good sign for the future. We have chosen the right path.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I too wish to thank my colleague, MrsÂ Bresso for her hard work. My Swedish colleagues and I have a number of misgivings, however.
At first reading of the proposal, Denmark and Sweden registered their reservations, as we are concerned about the directive adversely affecting the level of consumer protection where Member States have stricter national legislation, as does Sweden in this case. The Swedish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament still hold this view.
We also find the scope of the proposal too narrow, as it is strictly limited to the economic interests of consumers.
Our main objection to the proposal, however, is that it threatens to overturn the Swedish ban on TV advertising aimed at children.
This is currently governed by the Television without Frontiers Directive which, in turn, is in danger of being fully harmonised as a result of this proposal for a directive.
Unfortunately, the proposal does not afford children sufficient protection against advertising, as we discussed in this House earlier this evening.
The Swedish proposal to ban TV advertising aimed at children under the age of twelve is based on the same developmental theories that form the basis for our requirement that minors be protected against violence and pornography.
Children cannot be expected to view advertising critically or resist bait advertising directed at them.
That is why we ought to have had a stricter proposal with regard to advertising aimed at children.


Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me in my turn to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, for the quality of the draft that will be put to the vote tomorrow and which will serve to protect European consumers, especially those who are most vulnerable, against the aggressive tactics of unscrupulous operators.

This second reading of the common position on unfair commercial practices has demonstrated that, given the necessary political will, it is possible to formulate a European law which harmonises the wide diversity of national legal positions instead of pitting them against each other.
We must indeed remember that the European Commission, in its initial draft, proposed the application of the country-of-origin principle, and it was the Council that opted for a strategy of closer harmonisation, which our Parliament firmly supported at first reading.
Accordingly, I can only urge the Commission to learn the lessons from this directive and encourage the House to keep pursuing the path of harmonisation in respect of the draft instruments currently under discussion, and particularly the proposal for a directive on services as well as the proposal on measures to promote sales, on which a stalemate has been reached in the Council.

Â Â  .
Mr President, I should just like to say once again very briefly that this is a very important piece of legislation, not only for the protection of the consumer â I would say more than anything else â but also for the completion of the internal market and to help and protect bona fide traders. It is a realistic compromise; like all compromises, I am sure that many of us would like to certain aspects go further.
However, it is a realistic and workable compromise.
I agree with Mrs Wallis that this is a good example of how cooperation between the three institutions can produce positive results for European citizens.
Most of the concerns expressed today are met by the legislation. I remind you that, in respect to children and other vulnerable consumers, there is still the possibility of stricter measures by the Member States based on health, safety, taste and decency.
This gives Member States room for manoeuvre. The derogation period of six years for higher protection and standards will be very useful.
In the meantime, the Commission will come back with a report on the application and transposition of the directive, and we will also review every aspect and see how we can take it even further. In this respect, we will see how we can proceed with updating and increasing, if necessary, the list of practices contained in Annex I. I must remind you that the list may be modified only by revision of the directive.
Mr Harbour was right: my commitment to Parliament is to give priority to enforcement and implementation.
Otherwise, we can adopt the best laws but, unless they are transposed and implemented by the Member States, they will be of no value to European citizens.
This will be the Commission's first priority and will be reflected in the report, where we will present to you any problems in implementation.
I look forward to working together with you to get the Member States to implement and enforce this legislation.
Finally, I wish once again to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, for her excellent work.
I also wish to thank the Groups, the shadow rapporteurs and the chairman of the committee, who helped a lot in this respect.
I am very proud that this important piece of legislation comes under my competence. I am proud and very happy and take it as my duty to ensure that it will be transposed properly by the Member States.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, the new PSI.
The hurried e-mail from ThyssenKrupp, full of promises, which was sent to Members of the European Parliament this afternoon in anticipation of this debate, is not at all convincing.
It is time for action, not words.
Behind the hundreds of redundancies that have been announced lies the tragedy of hundreds of families who see an uncertain and more difficult future ahead.
A few days ago I held a political meeting of the new PSI at the Terni steelworks, where I could see unequivocally that Terni and Umbria as a whole are united and determined to fight on bravely and hard, not only in defence of their own productive and economic environment, but above all to uphold the dignity of the local community.
The Community institutions in general must not remain silent at this stage, since massive disinvestment and relocations of valuable production plant to non-EU countries are tearing Europeâs overall productive capacity apart. Moreover, it should be made clear in this specific case that ThyssenKrupp received funds and tax breaks from the Union when it decided to buy the Terni plant, and it gave an assurance that it would keep production in Italy and safeguard jobs.
All these commitments have been ignored in favour of Far Eastern scenarios. We should be asking ourselves what those scenarios are and to what extent union rights and guarantees will be observed.
In 1950, Robert Schuman launched the High Authority for Coal and Steel, thus establishing the basis and the guidelines for an ambitious and comprehensive journey towards unification, and not just in the economic sphere.
Now that such a complex political project has made great advances, let us not allow this particular strategic sector to be dismantled by remaining silent.
The institutional actors, especially the government, the Umbria region, the province and Terni municipality, need to agree on a common strategy with the social partners, who should be involved to a greater extent in the decision-making processes. The strategy should then be put firmly, frankly and decisively to ThyssenKrupp.
The company must accept its own responsibilities and give up its confused and somewhat devious defensive tactics. It should also be made clear that any further grant of public money should be conditional upon agreements â specific ones agreed by both sides this time â on jobs and local development and on investments designed to modernise production.
Commissioner, raising our voice to seek and to demand immediate, concrete solutions along these lines is our political duty, in order to preserve and protect a section of our economic network.
It is also a moral duty to those hundreds of workers, family men and women, who, with their eyes full of hope and never resigned, have been protesting at the gates of their steelworks for months.
Let us in this Chamber send them a clear message: âStand firm in your demands for the right to a future for yourselves and your children. Now that we are united, we stand beside you.â
Â Â  Mr President, being myself a blacksmith and therefore wanting to express my concern about the steel sector, I too would very much like to thank Mr Tajani. Although we know today that you can do business only if customers are willing to buy, businesses go bust or move away if policies are not in place to create the right conditions for them, and my specific question to Commissioner Å pidla is this: what will you do in order, in so far as possible, to limit the adverse effects of emissions trading on the steel industry?
We are faced with the prospect of a 15% rise in the cost of steel production, with another 15% being added on for energy costs. That represents a threat to Europeâs steel industry as a whole.
What will you be doing to prevent REACH from having detrimental effects on the steel industry, which is threatened and at serious risk? And will you, in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, be taking up the steel industryâs cause?
At the end of the day, this is also about how we guard the steel industry against the threat of the international hedge funds, with their speculation in steel, coke and coal meaning that responsible management is now no longer possible. This is where the Lisbon process imposes on us the responsibility of focussing on Europeâs lawmaking and of standing up for our industrial firms in order to safeguard the jobs they provide.
Seeing as we do today that five million jobs have been lost in Germany, and that there are five million more unemployed, we really do have to give some thought to how we get Europeâs industrial policies to create new jobs rather than doing away with ones that already exist.
This is where our Commissioner has a particular responsibility to make every effort for the sake of our jobs, and I thank him in anticipation of his doing just that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have explained the situation clearly and set out what needs to be done to resolve this most critical situation.
I have to bite my tongue and avoid referring back to some of the demands made concerning the REACH regulations, which will come into force in eleven years' time, undermining the competitiveness of Italian and European industry, which now seems to be facing very different and more immediate competitive challenges.
Like you, I have long union experience behind me, on which I should like to draw to make two observations.
Firstly, exactly one year ago, on 10 February 2004, we were discussing here in Parliament the case of Terni, the steel industry and the wider crisis in European steel-making.
On that very day we were informed that the dispute was being resolved at ministerial level and that negotiations were being started which were ultimately to lead to the June agreement which, today, ThyssenKrupp has once again torn up.
Why was such an agreement possible at that time?
In my view, for one fundamental reason only: because ThyssenKrupp had been isolated, both nationally and on a European level. The exceptional mobilisation of the workers and citizens of Terni and Umbria, as previously referred to, played a leading part in that political process.
The Terni plant is not a mere factory; it is an integral part of the town. Today, the same situation is being played out once again.
Today, as before, we are seeing an attack not only on a professional body, a production capability, a tradition, but on the dignity of the entire population of a town. This must be the starting point for the renewal of a powerful unity which will again leave ThyssenKrupp in an isolated position.
A second comment also drawn from my union background: why has ThyssenKrupp chosen today to take two apparently contradictory initiatives?
It has sent us the letter describing the problems in detail, while simultaneously laying off, or threatening to lay off, a further 600 workers, for more or less plausible reasons.
In my view, the company is afraid of being isolated again by this Parliament.
That explains the importance of the agenda on which we shall be voting tomorrow.
Commissioner, I appreciated your speech and the pointers you gave, notwithstanding the Commissionâs limited powers, of which we are perfectly well aware.
However, the Commission can perhaps do something politically, possibly at the most senior level, as it did last year, thereby making a significant contribution to the isolation of ThyssenKrupp.


Â Â  The next item is the oral question (B6-0012/2005) by Mr Ransdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, to the Commission, on the doubling of EU budgetary resources for research.
Â Â  â Mr President, I shall open the discussion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
I welcome Commissioner PotoÄnik here today.
There is a great deal of goodwill towards the Commissioner and the Commission as a whole with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme, as demonstrated by the speed with which the committee has conducted its business on the Locatelli report.
I hope the Commission will build upon this goodwill and not dissipate it.
The research community and the wider community expect a great deal from the Seventh Framework Programme, as it is seen as a crucial part of the Lisbon strategy for strengthening the European economy.
Research and development are key elements in that process.
Therefore, it is all the more important for us to get this right.
Commissioner, the purpose behind this oral question today is to give you the opportunity to share some thoughts with us before making your proposal to the Council and Parliament on how research is to be funded.
It seems to us that the crucial question relates to the doubling of expenditure on the research programme within the overall EU budget.
Can this fine ambition be achieved?
How it is going to be achieved?
We are looking with keen anticipation to you, Commissioner, to tell us how you think you are going to achieve that.
Bearing in mind the existence of the 'one per cent club' of Member States who wish to keep European-level spending within an overall cap of one per cent of GDP, I want to offer some suggestions as to ways in which spending on research might be increased at a European level, without necessarily breaching that one per cent cap, and given that there seems to be no lack of goodwill on the part of Member States to spend more on research.
The first suggestion is that the proposals for the spending programme with regard to research on security should be funded by the Member States at European level, but outside the Seventh Framework Programme.
Therefore, it would not count as part of the relevant budget item.
Secondly, I see great potential for using part of the Cohesion Fund for directing research spending to the new Member States, and I hope you will be sympathetic to that suggestion, Commissioner.
Now for the third suggestion.
Mr Mayor Oreja heads a special working group on the European Research Council, which has suggested that an independent body of scientists should take the programme of research forward, and that this should happen on the basis of excellence and scientific merit.
Quite a substantial budget has been proposed for this, totalling EURÂ 2Â billion a year once the working-up phase is complete.
That will take a huge slice of the existing framework budget.
I would therefore suggest that Member States should also consider funding that outside the context of the Seventh Framework Programme.
I hope we will take on board a number of the suggestions in the Marimon report.
One of the most frequently-voiced concerns about our research activities at European level is the complexity and burden involved in the administrative procedures and regulations relating to the funds, which make it very difficult for small- and medium-sized enterprises and small research entities to access the funds and take part in the programmes.
We all pay at least lip service to this.
Even when were debating the Fourth Framework Programme, there was a great deal of concern about that.
We talk about it; let us hope this time, Commissioner, you are able to do something about it.
The objective of pursuing excellence above all else is crucial to achieving successful research at European level.
I look forward to your comments about how we fund all this with keen interest, Commissioner.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank you, and in particular the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, for this opportunity to discuss in plenary the issue of doubling the research budget.
I start by saying how happy I am that Mrs Locatelli's report on the future of European research received almost unanimous support from the ITRE committee on Monday.
This report, which I understand will be voted on in the March part-session, gives us an excellent grounding in preparing the formal Commission proposal for the new framework programme.
I would particularly like to thank two members of the committee, MrÂ Chichester and Mrs Locatelli.
Allow me first to underline that today's discussion is not just important for research.
It is a debate about nothing less than our credibility to reach the Lisbon objectives, and is a crucial debate for both our institutions only a few weeks before Europe hopefully agrees on the financial means for the next decade.
The discussion about the new Financial Perspectives is a moment of truth and the question of sufficient funding for European research is an essential part of it.
This is because research is about knowledge, and knowledge is truly a European strength in global competition.
Let me explain.
Some of our trading partners are competing with primary resources, which we do not have.
Some compete with cheap labour, which we do not want.
Some compete on the back of the environment, which we cannot accept.
The only way for European enterprise to build sustainable leadership is to exploit the knowledge triangle fully: the creation, transmission and use of knowledge through research, education, training and of course innovation.
My strong conviction is that European enterprises will only achieve competitiveness and leadership on global markets if we rapidly put Europe in the lead as an economy and as a knowledge society.
We are strong in knowledge, but we can become even stronger if we pool our efforts in an intelligent way; if we give full emphasis to excellence; and if we use the full research potential throughout the EU â old, new and future.
This is what I want the next research programme to stand for.
Knowledge does not only mean more competitive businesses.
It also brings continuous progress to society: progress in fields such as health; preservation of the environment; and sustainable energy supply.
All of these rest largely on the progress of knowledge.
In view of this, the questions you raised are indeed the right ones.
First, will the Commission fight for the doubling of the research budget?
The answer is yes.
In February 2004, when launching the debate on policy challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged Union, the Commission emphasised the role research will play in building our common future and consequently proposed the doubling of the budget.
This was reaffirmed in the Commission's communication on the Financial Perspectives last July and President Barroso confirmed the approach to this House last December, when he endorsed the Financial Perspective that had been proposed by the Prodi Commission.
The last confirmation came in the proposal of the Lisbon mid-term review.
It spells out clearly the importance of investment in research and development.
On behalf of the European Commission, I can therefore confirm not only our strong commitment to research, but also that we will do everything to achieve the doubling of the research budget.
Second, does this doubling take account of the programme's duration, inflation, enlargement and the need to support new actions?
I am very grateful for these questions.
It is good that we clarify these fully justified issues.
FP7 will be the principal financial tool for realising the ambitious objective of driving productivity growth and ensuring competitiveness through knowledge.
When I speak about the doubling of funds I am talking about doubling the budget of FP7.
This figure does not include related Community programmes such as Mr Gunther Verheugen's programme for competitiveness and innovation.
Our proposal will not simply be a doubling of the initial FP6 budget.
It will be built on the basis of the yearly amount to be spent on research during the period 2007-2013 compared to the yearly estimated amount for FP6, and revised following accession.
This means doubling on a yearly basis regardless of the duration of FP7.
Moreover, in the Financial Perspectives these amounts will be adjusted for inflation according to our general calculation methods.
Enlargement is one particular issue.
In the area of research, enlargement was a reality long before the Accession Treaty was signed.
The current candidate countries also participate in the Framework Programme.
I could, therefore, answer this question by saying that it is true that enlargement has been taken into account, but I would have to add immediately that it is not only in the budgetary figures that enlargement needs to be taken into account.
I want this programme to be built on excellence, because I know this is also a strength of the new Member States.
However in addition, I want this programme to be an enabling one that allows the use of the full research potential in the new Member States and creates an active and effective link with the Structural Funds.
Additional new areas of research are included and are part of the justification for doubling the funds.
Thirdly, will the FP7 proposal cover basic research, space research and security research?
To be brief, our FP7 proposal will be all inclusive, i.e. there will be no mechanisms outside the framework programme.
Let me make an important addition here.
Parliament has highlighted that the complementary objectives of continued reinforcement of existing EU research support, on the one hand, and of support to new areas of research that are of interest to the EU, on the other, require adequate funding.
In other words, it would not be possible to strengthen existing activities in an efficient way and, at the same time, introduce widely supported new activities, such as the European Research Council and technology initiatives, if the research budget was not doubled.
Doubling will enable us to take a decisive step forward in our overall research policy and in continuing support for the European Research Area.
Agreement on the substance of future research activities necessarily implies agreement on adequate funding for these activities.
Fourthly, how will the Commission try to influence the debate on the Financial Perspectives to achieve the doubling of research funds?
In order to underpin the debate on the Financial Perspectives, the Commission will present its proposal for FP7 on 6 April.
This will help Parliament to give its preliminary reactions to the Council that your rapporteur, Mr Borg is planning to present during the May part-session.
It will also allow the ministries for research and science to have an initial discussion at the Competitiveness Council on 18 April.
The Commission proposal will provide sound justification for doubling the budget for FP7, based on a detailed and thorough assessment of the impact of the research and development instruments on investment in growth and jobs.
I will list the two main reasons for doubling the funding.
The first â and, for me, the most important set of reasons â is the need for the European Union to be credible in delivering the renewed Lisbon Agenda on growth and jobs.
This includes the need to deliver results on the 3% GDP target for research and development that was mutually agreed in Barcelona.
Doubling the funding is one of the crucial steps towards a more growth-oriented European Union budget.
The second set of reasons is more specific to research and development spending.
Firstly, we need high public spending on research and development because it is an important source of R[amp]D investment and for its strong leverage effect on private investments in research and development in the future.
Secondly, we need more R[amp]D funding at EU level because of the strong added value of European research funding through the critical mass of resources, sharing of knowledge and facilities, strengthening excellence through close cooperation, competition at European level, the coordination of national activities and support for European Union policies.
Let me add to that the fact that we are currently rejecting an unacceptable number of excellent proposals purely because of the lack of financial resources.
In addition, there is the need and willingness to fund new category and activity initiatives which demonstrate high value added impact at EU level without, however, endangering existing ones.
Finally, we should not forget the very simple fact that the costs of research itself are also growing.
Your fifth question was whether the duration of FP7 should be synchronised with the Financial Perspectives to ensure a better coordination of planning activities?
Reaching the goals that I have described will require a long-term view and commitment.
That is why the Commission will propose that the duration of FP7 should be the same overall as the next Financial Perspective for 2007-13.
We should take stock mid-way through the programme to ensure that FP7 continues to respond to the needs faced by the European economy and citizens.
By doing so we will introduce more stability on the one hand, and more flexibility on the other.
Both factors are needed.
I should also like to take this opportunity to underline the exemplary execution rates in the research budget.
The current execution rates are close to 100%.
We have proved in the past that we can effectively manage constantly increased FP budgets.
We are aware that the challenge to managing the doubling of the funds is demanding, but we are determined to provide proper answers.
Simplification and rationalisation of procedures are greatly needed.
Administration and modernised management, including externalisation, will provide answers to this challenge.
The proposals in the field of research are at the core of the delivery of the new Lisbon Agenda.
That is the only way we can succeed.
The time for delivery is now.
Building a knowledge society is probably the best, and perhaps only, way to sustain the European social model without having to make a trade-off between economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection.
The first and foremost policy priority for the Union is thus to strongly support the three sides of the knowledge triangle â research, education and innovation â and to ensure that the triangle operates in the most favourable framework conditions.
The change in the structure of the European budget in favour of more growth and competitive oriented expenses in the direction proposed by the Commission is thus crucial.
This structural change to the European budget should also be followed by the Member States in their budgets.
The doubling of funds in the European budget should not be seen as compensation for the reduction of Member States' efforts.
On the contrary, it should be an example followed by the Member States.
Their effort is necessary.
If we do not make the effort now, we will have to make it later; but it will be more difficult later and it could even be too late.
I intend to do my best to achieve the vision I have described because I believe it is the right one.
We can bring it to life by working together.
That is why I ask for your support.
I trust that I will receive it, for the sake of the European model of life and for the sake of Europe's future.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday this House discussed the European driving licence, and I believe that part of the current policy is to press hard on the accelerator of the vehicle in which we are travelling, and this is something on which I should like very much like to congratulate Commissioner PotoÄnik.
He is also taking steps to ensure that the Lisbon agenda is implemented and promises great things, such as new jobs and higher incomes for our people.
On the other hand, there are Commissioners who are in favour of REACH and emissions trading, which would result in the relocation of large parts of our industry outside Europe.
I should therefore like to congratulate the Commissioner on having made a knowledge-based European Union his main priority, and on not merely following in the footsteps of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, but intends to strike out on an entirely new path with the Seventh Framework Programme.
The aim of this is not only to implement the Lisbon criteria, but above all to target the Financial Perspectives at new, better and more secure jobs and to ensure that Europe can hold its own in international competition, as what a further priority should be to safeguard existing jobs.
Achieving this by 2010 will be a far from easy task.
Whether it takes place on the basis of a certain percentage of GDP or not, and however it is calculated, we regard doubling as a way to send out a signal, namely that on the one hand we are debating using 1% of GDP for the European Union, but that on the other hand we are talking about spending 3% on research.
It is apparent from this how large the gap is when it comes to dealing efficiently with issues relating to our future.
I believe that this goal â knowledge-based training and further training and life-long learning in connection with research findings at university, with a clear focus on new jobs â must be pursued, and that for this reason we must also demand of the Research Council that its representatives from business and research departments have a large say in shaping the goals, and that the political goals we fund with the Lisbon agenda are implemented accordingly and that we get a grip on bureaucracy.
We are stumbling from one accusation of fraud to another, and a great deal of criticism is currently being levelled at Europe.
Yet we should highlight the positive aspects, and the opportunities we are creating in Europe for our citizens.
I should therefore like to urge MrÂ PotoÄnik to come to Parliament immediately after the programme has been adopted in the European Commission on 6Â April.
An extended Conference of Presidents will take place here, and the President of the Commission should join you in presenting the Seventh Framework Programme to the public.
We should take this opportunity to make a big impression on the public, and to show them that we take the Lisbon goals seriously and want to achieve them.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has been virtually unanimous on this issue, because we are certain that only long-term commitment to increased resources for research channelled through the Seventh EU Framework Programme can help us to pull through.
We are adding this to the Lisbon objectives, as I noticed the Commissioner is also doing. We are therefore in agreement with Commissioner PotoÄnik.
The problem is the Member States.
It is the Finance Ministers of the Member States and Ecofin that are our targets and whom we should be grabbing by the scruff of the neck.
Only two Member States have achieved the 3% target for research, my own country being one of them.
We therefore have a lot of housework to do.
We require some exceptionally determined work from the Commission, and this really is, as you have said, the first test, or actually a test both for you and for us.
The funding is to be doubled, but where is it being channelled?
This must be kept in mind the whole time, because it is no good having funding unless you know what to do with it.
I would like to know exactly which areas it is destined for.
How important, for example, is the lack of digital literacy?
It has been calculated that we lose three hours a week because of it.
Here, moreover, the working week is being lengthened.
In many cases these three hours would salvage our economy.
At the same time, of course, we have to consider enlargement.
I am one of those who believe that 1% on the budget is not enough to take care of enlargement, the Lisbon Process and many other matters.
We certainly knew that enlargement would cost money, and the budget cannot subsequently be reduced: it should remain at the same level it has done up till now.
Finally, we need more training, know-how and research.
That is the only way out of this vicious circle of competitiveness.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, MrÂ PotoÄnik, ladies and gentlemen, we are calling for research funds to be doubled with respect to the Sixth Framework Programme, without asking ourselves whether the latter programme is an appropriate yardstick.
In fact, when it was established, there was not yet such a pressing need to revitalise the competitiveness of the European Union, such a massive and important enlargement had not taken place, international competition had not yet emerged so forcefully, and nor had a knowledge-based strategy such as the Lisbon strategy yet been formulated.
All of that has now happened and, furthermore, very little has been done in terms of the Lisbon objectives.
We therefore need to make up for lost time, considering that half of the time laid down for them has already passed.
We must pull out all the stops, starting precisely with research, which sustains all the progress we make.
To this end, last Monday the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy approved the three main lines of action for the next framework programme: the European Research Council, the new research proposals and the technology platforms.
The European Research Council has emerged out of the acknowledgment that basic research now has an importance which goes beyond the Member States and must be supported at Union level and in accordance with the Lisbon strategy.
It is an initial focus around which we can elaborate a development and competitiveness policy, which will then be filled out in the technology platforms.
These platforms must obtain resources chiefly from enterprises, but also from public institutions, the Member States, regions and local authorities, in order to organise research of general interest and to help businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, meet the need for research in order to make them competitive.
These are sound, decisive innovations which will give fresh impetus to our businesses.
We must have a presence in the new sectors, adopt innovative measures and provide conventional manufacturing businesses with a new competitive capacity if we do not wish to sit idly by as Europe undergoes full deindustrialisation.
We must be consistent and invest in research which, even when it is not strictly targeted, has an extremely high potential for return.
Perhaps it will not suffice to double the funds but, in any case, we cannot afford to be too sparing when it comes to these resources.
I would make it clear that the Commission can count on the support of Parliament in order to face this challenge.
Â Â  . â Mr PotoÄnik, we Greens are pleased with the new impetus you wish to provide for research and we support this substantial promotion of European research.
Nevertheless, not only are we concerned about the budget, but also about the social and environmental ends, because we all want a larger cake.
However, of primary importance are the ingredients of the cake and how it is cooked and then, but also extremely important, how the cake of European research is shared out.
We want open science, with a fluid and open transfer of knowledge to all sectors of society, and, within this context, we are worried that some patents may represent obstacles to innovation in the case of small and/or young companies.
At the same time, we want to see a type of research for which small is beautiful, in which SMEs, small laboratories and small universities are treated as priorities within European programmes.
Within this context, we want to create âclustersâ, groups of small companies at European level, in order to prevent all research from being concentrated within a few projects.
In the field of research, we should promote a return to basics, to fundamentals, so that basic scientific research can be supported openly and provided with more funds.
We must offer more public support to basic research, with social and environmental objectives in the medium and long terms, rather than restricting ourselves to achieving short-term technological performance.
In this regard, there must also be more investment in preventive health and not just in pharmaceutical research, as has happened in the past.
Furthermore, we must invest in protecting the climate and not direct all or most of our investment in energy towards nuclear programmes.
Renewable energy currently needs a level of support which is at least equivalent to that being given to the ITER or Euratom programmes.
We are pleased with Mr PotoÄnikâs projects in support of social sciences, since they are essential to progress in research into our society.
Finally, I would like to call for the creation of an independent European Research Council, with the participation of all the social actors, so that there may be a genuinely fruitful debate, a dialogue, between society and the scientific world.
Â Â  . Voltaire once said that the secret to being boring is to say everything, so I shall limit myself to making only a few points.
The first relates to the total volume of funding for science and research.
I believe that certain instruments that we could use, such as European securities, are currently being neglected.
In the USA a number of key projects are funded by securities, and this could also act as a financial basis for key European projects.
Another way to boost funding would be to exploit the resources available in the new Member States.
The research potential in these countries is extremely strong, although it is currently underfunded.
The costs of achieving research goals could realistically be reduced if these countries were involved.
My third point relates to the way in which the 3% is to be structured.
The Commission is relying on two thirds of this money coming from the private sector.
This will be very difficult to achieve, however, given that only 3% of small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay 85% of all business taxes and provide 75% of jobs, currently invest in research, and 40% of them are involved in innovation.
We will make no progress in this field without a new policy on depreciation, generous funding for investment, flexible legislation, a new credit policy and tax relief.
I believe that it is also crucial that there be a high ratio of research workers to technicians.
At present the European Union is lagging 50% behind the US with regard to the number of researchers for every 1000 workers; in other words, the US has 50% more researchers for every 1000 workers.
Major technological breakthroughs and key discoveries need to be based on a constant stream of minor innovations, and at present this is not happening.
Finally, I should like to note that research follows certain laws.
In the past this was analysed in terms of Kondratiev waves, whereby key breakthroughs were found to be concentrated in clearly defined clusters.
We should provide generous funding in order to ensure that clusters of this kind come into being once again.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being present at this important debate today.
If you want to double funding â and many millions of Europeans would be in favour of doing so, if only they knew anything about it, and indeed I am in favour of it, although I only know a little about it â what investments do you actually want to boost by doing so?
Experience has shown that 80% of funding from the Fifth and Sixth Framework Programmes has gone to the large corporations, and only 20% to those that could be termed SMEs or that are of an even smaller size.
I believe that the main reason for this is that lobbyists â in particular those acting on behalf of the large corporations â have an above-average amount of influence.
They have long since taken a good look around and asked where they can get even more money if funding is to be doubled.
These people are very good at their jobs.
The second most important reason, however, lies within the Commission itself.
Many of the measures you take â and having been a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for many years, I can say that this has always been the case â demonstrate that you still follow the same old motto as the World Bank: âbig is beautifulâ.
It is an unfortunate fact that the Commission is making the same mistake that the World Bank made, by constantly funding oversized projects all over the world.
The new and enlarged Commission has a real chance of preventing such a mistake and moving away from the 80:20 ratio that favours large businesses.
This would be a sure-fire way of creating jobs, and it would mean that progress was made with all aspects of the European dream.
The second question, of course, is which areas really receive investment.
I should like to warn you against pretending to Europeans that military armament in the field of research can result in any kind of positive progress, and against making the same mistakes that history is full of.
What we are seeing is a new armament by stealth in the EU, and I can only issue the most fervent of warnings against it.
Less dramatic, but equally important, is the nuclear issue.
It is absolutely crucial, Commissioner, that if you wish to double funding you must make it quite clear what is actually going where.
Transparency is needed so that people know exactly where funding is intended to go, and so that action is not taken behind closed doors.
When it comes to informing the public about how funds are used, the European Union will have to decide whether it wishes to move towards propaganda â made what it is by Josef Goebbels, himself the subject of much debate at present â or towards information, with the pioneer of this approach being Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
For Europe's sake, I would ask that you move towards informing citizens about funding.
As a final point, I believe that 1% of GDP from Member States will be more than enough for you to manage with.
There are a great many ways in which money could be saved in the EU.
This House alone has EURÂ 50Â million to spend this year, and has no idea what it should do with it all.
In this instance less would mean more, and doubling is in no way incompatible with a maximum of 1%, which is what many countries want.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, following a half-hour analysis of the Lisbon strategy, there is no need to emphasise that it is essential to strengthen research and innovation in the European Union.
The main indicators for developments in this sector clearly show not only that we are lagging behind the world leaders, but mainly that we are unable to make use of our own research and innovation potential.
There is an undoubted need sharply to increase the volume of resources allocated to this important area, but this must be in line with our financial perspectives.
It is not, however, clear how this is to be implemented.
The framework programmes for research and technological development, which have been the main tool in the European Unionâs implementation strategy, have been found, for various reasons and throughout their existence, to be inadequate in promoting the research and innovation potential of mainly small and medium-sized enterprises.
It has been most frequently a matter of the complexity of the entire structure and procedures for access to financial resources, which deters mainly small research and innovation units or small companies.
Regional experiences also point to other reasons: there is a lack of an adequate regional infrastructure, relevant institutions, such as university development centres, technological incubators, high-tech centres and so on but also of risk capital funds, which would, on the one hand, stimulate regional innovation and research potential in its broader sense, but also create a stronger competitive environment, on the other hand.
The European Union budget must take account of both an increased level of financing for its framework programmes and a strengthened budget for the structural funds in order to establish a regional research infrastructure and also strengthened programmes for the European financial institutions to stimulate the development of regional risk capital funds.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Commission communication on the guidelines for the Seventh Framework Programme and in its proposals for the Financial Perspectives, reference is made, in general terms, to doubling the funds.
This affirmation needs to be substantiated, something which you, MrÂ PotoÄnik, have already done in part.
In addition to the issues of enlargement and the new activity headings, namely space and research, I would point out that the Constitutional Treaty confers fresh powers on the Union in the field of research.
I would also like to mention that the European Research Council will be established, a new instrument which we assume will use up 10 to 15% of the overall resources of the Seventh Framework Programme.
MrÂ PotoÄnik, you are already aware of the outcome of the vote of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the guidelines for the Seventh Framework Programme.
The document calls for additional funding within the Seventh Framework Programme for the European Research Council.
It also states that a doubling of the budget is the bare minimum if we truly intend to give substance to a European Research Area and pursue the objectives under the Lisbon strategy.
I would ask you whether you agree with the European Research Council being funded from additional resources.
And with regard to doubling the budget, what is meant by doubling?
We need to find a criterion and I would suggest a criterion of proportion, that is, the framework programme resources as a percentage of the Unionâs gross domestic product.
That is the percentage that we should double.
I therefore ask you, do you agree with this interpretation of doubling?
Moreover, we know that at this stage in the preparation of the Financial Perspectives, there is a major debate underway among the Member States because some of them intend to cut their contribution to the budget of the European Union to 1%.
These cuts are likely to have negative repercussions on the âresearch appropriationsâ item.
Do you agree to fight hard to oppose this position taken by the less generous Member States?
And if, in any case, these cuts are effected, will you still be in favour of calling for the funds to be doubled?
The Seventh Framework Programme must not merely be a new framework programme, but it must mark a turning-point, in line with the Unionâs new powers, if we really want to create a new European Research Area.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am very pleased that the basic, underlying idea concerning how we are to achieve better development in Europe is now the knowledge-based economy.
I think that this is the answer to a very large number of problems.
I also think it is right to focus on education, research and innovation, dealing with each of these areas separately but also in the context of the other two.
I also think that the technology platforms will serve a very useful purpose.
It is good that the social sciences are included in this connection.
What we need to focus on is, of course, the infrastructure surrounding research, about which we have not yet had a great deal of discussion.
In this context, I should like to raise two matters that are of concern to me.
The first relates to the way in which European researchers experience professional and social conditions at a personal level.
We see how, in the current situation, large numbers of people are leaving research for other jobs because they find it impossible to carve out careers and create good bases for family life, given the rules and conditions we lay down for them.
This is, of course, all the more regrettable now we know that, with this new research policy, we shall require not fewer, but twice as many, researchers.
I want to know what measures the Commission intends to take in this area.
The second matter of concern to me is, of course, industryâs share of the total resources allocated to research.
The general trend in all the Member States is for this to go down instead of up.
I want to know what the Commission is doing to make industry more enthusiastic about investing more in research and development.
Now that we are seeing the framework for a new European research policy, we must, finally, at the same time also think about how to translate these research results into job opportunities.
I should therefore also like to see an initial fundamental framework programme for innovation.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am of course in favour of doubling the EU budgetary resources allocated to research.
When you realise that public and private research and development expenditure in the EU amounts to only 1.95% of GDP compared with 2.64% in the United States and 2.98% in Japan, you can see how much the famous Lisbon strategy and the Commission have failed.
That is why I believe that if the European Union is to have an effective research policy, we must not only double the appropriations for research but also review and radically question the methods and objectives of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development implemented by the European Commission and the Council.
Indeed, contrary to the philosophy of the Seventh Framework Programme, a successful research and development system can only be based on cooperation and exchange between public and private researchers and laboratories and not on all out competition and shortage of money.
What I fear the most is that resources will be concentrated in a small number of priority areas of research, which are bound to be those most likely to bring immediate profits for the large industrial groups, at the expense of fundamental physics and the human and social sciences; that would mean researcher recruitment and careers would probably no longer be based on scientific assessment but on priorities directly dictated by the interests of the multinationals involved in the framework programmeâs activities.
For my part, I, of course, believe that research expenditure must be taken out of the Stability Pact calculation, but that is not enough.
It is even more important that questions of research in Europe should no longer be decided by the Commission alone, but by elected representatives of the scientific community.
I therefore propose the creation of a representative assembly of all researchers at the European Parliament.
That assembly would have such important tasks as ethical appraisal, the drafting of recommendations, encouraging cooperation, monitoring and continuity of the funding granted, and ensuring that the regions are not forced to compete with each other.
That is the only way in which the European Union will be able to look to the future with greater optimism.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have two minutes in which to make two points and bring them together.
As you know better than we do, Commissioner, the research programmes will have an even greater effect if you use them to build a bridge between, on the one hand, the research and development programmes under the Cohesion Policy, and, on the other, the Seventh Framework Programme.
If the two instruments are brought into line with each other, they will be a great deal more far-reaching in their effects.
Please allow me to give an example from my own region, which is bounded by the frontiers between the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium.
Commissioner, the universities of Eindhoven, Louvain, and Aachen, as well as those of Hasselt and Maastricht, now cooperate closely in research, training and development, as well as in the field of cohesion projects.
I believe that similar cross-border collaborative projects deserve to be followed and encouraged, as they primarily reinforce the regional dimension as part of the Lisbon process.
Surely nobody can object to the towns, universities and regions within which they move and operate playing such a role?
We were therefore particularly pleased to see the Commission accept an amendment to that effect proposed by Mr van Nistelrooij to the Locatelli report after all, which Parliament approved at the beginning of this week.
In it, this House expressly requests cooperation with the regions and the coupling of, on the one hand, national programmes under the Structural Funds and, on the other, programmes under the Seventh Framework Programme.
To sum up, Commissioner, businesses are, as you know, ready to invest and to anticipate the opportunities that are presenting themselves.
If we in the EU, who deal with financial matters, now allow them to pass by, if our fine words about innovation policy are not followed up by action, then our credibility will, of course, be shattered â both yours and ours, I would say.
We will then be giving national governments the ideal excuse for not coming up with the national funding that is so vitally needed.
At the moment there exists what is termed a âwindow of opportunityâ, with many members of government at every level â regional, national and, of course, European too â being convinced that we must drastically upgrade our investments in innovation.
If we simply allow this to ebb away, then I think we will have to look among ourselves to find the reason why.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I too should like to thank the Commissioner for emphasising that, in line with the Lisbon objectives, Europe should be competing on the basis of knowledge and not on the basis of poor wages or environmental destruction.
Of course, knowledge is now to be understood in the broad sense of the word, and if we look at the proposals for the Seventh Framework Programme in the context of the Sixth â and also going back to the Fifth Framework Programme â we can see that socioeconomic research played an important part at that time and contributed to an analysis and understanding of the interaction between advanced technologies and social development.
Separating scientific and sociological research when drafting the Seventh Framework Programme has, however, in actual fact put sociological research into budgetary competition with technological research in relation to the IST programme.
This tends to marginalise the relevance of socioeconomic research, and, in future, technological research should therefore be developed in tandem with the development of societyâs needs, values and expectations.
Socioeconomic research in the information society is a precondition for our achieving this objective.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, with the justified momentum which has developed today in favour of research, I personally feel that the doubling of funding is one of the , as our ancestors would have said.
However, I should like to take the opportunity of today's debate to approach the matter differently.
I therefore ask:
First, is it or is it not our strategic choice that the European economy should become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010?
Secondly, if the answer is yes, I would like to know the degree to which, in order to achieve this objective â and this is something in which I truly believe â the economy of the European Union must become and it is enough if it becomes a knowledge-based economy?
Thirdly, if the answer is again yes then, logically, should the European research community, companies and industry not be wondering about the means needed to complete this mission?
In other words, should the bottom-up approach not be used in our case, by which I mean consultation with the people who produce knowledge and innovation in Europe, in the aim of our agreeing where and exactly how much we should invest in order to achieve our objective?
Commissioner, ultimately what we need to achieve is not double the resources, but our strategic objective and this begs the question as to whether double is enough to achieve our objective.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ PotoÄnik, I too would like to thank you for your comprehensive reply.
There is no question that if we are to achieve the objectives set in the Lisbon strategy for 2010, we must be committed to improving substantially the resources dedicated to Research and Development, since that is the central pivot of a knowledge-based economy and, therefore, the main tool for promoting growth, employment and competitiveness.
Consequently, we agree that the Union's scientific policy should be placed at the centre of the strategy for the coming years, and also that overall spending on Research and Development should be set at 3% of the Union's GDP, and, of course, I agree with what most of the previous speakers have said.
I would like to add something else.
It is certainly very important to reduce the technological gap between the Union and countries such as the United States, but it is just as true that within the Union there is another significant technological gap between the different countries, which we must also try to reduce.
In this regard, our objective must be to improve the competitiveness of the Union as a whole, in order to narrow the gap with the most technologically-advanced countries, but we must do so in such a way that this does not involve increasing the differences between our various countries in terms of technological capacity.
It is therefore very important, Commissioner, that we take concrete measures to improve the capacity of the countries which so far have participated less in the framework programme.
Commissioner, we would ask that you commit yourself to reducing the internal technological gap which unquestionably also exists within our Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to get to grips with the Lisbon strategy, we must invest in research, development and innovation.
In order to do that, we need money, and so we must increase funding.
Commissioner, you have my full support in obtaining the Councilâs agreement with the help of this House.
Secondly, if we ask for more money we must see to it that these funds are put to the best possible use.
We must also learn the lessons from the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, and make procedures simpler, less bureaucratic and more streamlined.
I see this as an absolutely crucial task that we must all strive to achieve, and both the Commission and Parliament are needed in this respect.
The members of the Committee on Budgets are presently examining the Financial Regulation, and this is another area where work must be done and improvements made.
Commissioner, this is another task for which you and your College are needed.
What is needed is professional project management, and I am eagerly awaiting your proposals on this issue on 6Â April.
Finally, I should like to return to the lessons we should learn from the Sixth Framework Programme.
Industry involvement fell under the Sixth Framework Programme, and we must come up with ideas of ways to buck this trend.
If we are serious about the Lisbon goals, we simply need more investment in research and development.
Such investment must also come from the private sector, and I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's ideas in response to the following question; how do you intend to get industry, in small and medium-sized enterprises, more involved in the Seventh Framework Programme?
I listened very attentively to MrÂ Ransdorfâs comments; he mentioned that we need, among other things, a better depreciation policy and more flexible legislation.
These are useful considerations, but I would be interested to hear the Commissioner's proposals in this regard as well.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, research and innovation are the basic tools for implementing the Lisbon strategy.
The Seventh Framework Programme has presented us with a unique opportunity to move towards this goal by improving the way we exploit the intellectual potential of the European Unionâs 450Â million citizens, including its almost 80Â million new citizens in the new Member States.
The Seventh Framework Programme should accelerate European integration, and it should provide not only for a much-needed and significant rise in funding, but also for measures under which this funding will be put to effective use.
This will only be possible if entirely new and innovative methods are devised for implementing European policy on science.
The main priority should be to alter the criteria according to which funds are distributed, as this will make it possible to establish centres of expertise at institutions where the researchers are based.
Students from Central and Eastern Europe do not wish to be treated as an afterthought, or sometimes merely as the odd ones out, in âCentres of Excellenceâ programmes, as is the case under the current Sixth Framework Programme.
Two questions come to mind in this connection.
The first is whether the concept of âexcellenceâ is not being misused here as a strange kind of curse, which can later be invoked to justify an unequal distribution of funds.
We should not strive for excellence only with regard to gaining and spending funds.
The second question that arises concerns the kind of objective criteria for the distribution of funds provided for in the Seventh Framework Programme.
I thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, I much appreciate the strong support of this House.
It is very encouraging for my future work.
Many questions were asked, some of which I cannot answer very precisely, but I will group them together and try to be as informative as possible.
The calculation behind doubling is made in real terms on a yearly basis and with the same assumptions in mind as with the other aspects of the debate on the new financial perspective.
At the end of the day it is crucial that we double the funds as a percentage of GDP.
That is a credible way of looking at it.
Our proposal was based on that thinking and I believe that this proposal is ambitious enough to achieve our goals.
I am more afraid of going backwards than of asking whether it goes far enough, although even that question is credible, too, and could be approached in an official way.
Public funding is not the only funding.
As you know, public funding is estimated as being approximately one-third, with two-thirds private funding.
So it is crucial that we increase public funding, because of the source and because of the leverage effect on private investment.
However, as some of you stressed, it is even more crucial to create conditions under which companies will stay and invest in Europe.
The latest figures are not promising: in 2002, investment by the 500 biggest companies in the European Union decreased by 2%; investment by the 500 biggest non-EU companies increased by 3.9%.
In Europe, around 24% of investment involves the car and spare part industries.
In the rest of the world, information technology is the biggest sector with regard to investment.
Those are the facts we have to deal with.
That is why it is crucial to create a better environment for research and development.
Ways of doing this might include state aid; tax incentives; intellectual property rights; the structural and cohesion funds; and risk and venture capital, which is certainly one of the problems.
Two days ago, I met the President of the European Investment Bank and we have already started to prepare actions in an effort to address that problem.
Environment is crucial.
If we want to achieve our goal, we need to create an environment in which companies will work, compete and carry out their research and development activities in Europe.
The framework programme now being discussed in the Commission has to take account of the Lisbon Agenda.
I would like it to be simple, flexible, understandable, easily applicable and based on continuity.
We would like to establish four major areas of support.
First, cooperation.
Today we call this the 'collaborative approach', although in some countries the term 'collaboration' is not particularly acceptable.
That area should be more industry-driven than it was in the past.
That is why technology platforms should play an important role in deciding where money will go and how decisions are taken.
It will be more thematically orientated and less instrumental than in the past.
I believe that is the proper way to do it.
The second area is ideas.
This means the European Research Council.
This area is researcher-driven, so the division between basic and applicable research is practically outdated.
We would try to make it clear what is industry-driven, what is politically driven and what is research-driven.
That will be more transparent.
We will give everyone the opportunity to make known their views on this.
The third area should be people.
The major problem there is that they have been under-financed.
The fourth area is capacities, which involves infrastructure, SMEs, regions and research potential.
Here, we would like to address the question of new Member States, but not in a way that would undermine the excellence of the programme.
Researchers in those countries should be supported so that they develop and become more visible.
We should establish actions which allow us to access the structural and cohesion funds.
The worst thing for the new Member States and their researchers would be to create conditions under which they would not be able to compete.
It is best for them to develop rapidly so that they are competitive from the very beginning.
They are doing that already.
I am very much aware that conditions in some countries mean that they cannot compete.
We have to help them, but the question is how we do this.
Our programme seeks to achieve excellence and competitiveness in the EU, which is crucial.
We have structural and cohesion funds for solidarity.
If we are using these funds for road, rail and environmental infrastructure, we could and should use them for the development of research infrastructure as well.
It is crucial that we create conditions in which researchers from the new Member States will remain in these countries and compete and cooperate with others in the European Union.
Simplification and streamlining should be the name of the game, otherwise we will have major problems.
I am aware of all the challenges ahead of me and I count on your support.
The Commission is not the only body involved: I have created a taskforce in my directorate.
We now also have an inter-service task force.
We are now organising sounding boards among SMEs and smaller groups, to give them a chance to voice their opinions on the proposals.
Framework programmes, research and development structures, cohesion programmes, and competitiveness and innovation programmes are crucial.
These should seek to achieve the same goals.
That is one of the points I would especially like to underline.
For smaller users, we are trying to establish better definitions for the instruments, which are often far from user-friendly, especially the integrated projects.
On the other hand, simplification and streamlining are major problems for smaller users.
For them, costs are proportionally much higher and burdens are greater than they are for the bigger users.
I believe these two things will be crucial.
We should bring more SMEs into the process itself.
In conclusion, I believe that the talks on the next financial perspective will be a kind of moment of truth.
I hope that we will be strong enough to reach conclusions which tally with the Commission's proposal.
I am afraid that if certain changes are made the structure of the budget will be worse than it is now.
Thank you for your support.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his outstanding answers, and to apologise for the fact that a fellow Member asked extremely aggressive questions, while not thinking it worth his while to wait for your answers to them.
I should like to thank you for taking this initiative, which bids this House continue its cooperation on the issue.
Â Â  For that fine example of Austrian politeness and correctness, I should like to thank you.
Â Â  The next item is the report under Rule 134 of the Rules of Procedure on a specific action for transfers of vessels to countries hit by the tsunami in 2004 (COM(2005)0036 â C6-0036/2005 â2005/0005(CNS)).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow-Commissioner MrÂ Borg, who has unfortunately been unable to fly to Strasbourg due to the heavy snow.
Concerning the subject, I wish to thank Members of Parliament for accepting the urgency procedure, and the members of the Committee on Fisheries for their support and their efficiency in handling that matter.
The tsunami disaster devastated the coastal areas of numerous Asian countries and, besides tourism, the fisheries and aquaculture sector of these countries was the most affected.
Parliament and the Council have already welcomed and encouraged the initiatives taken by the Commission, in particular the measures aimed at rebuilding the sector in the areas concerned.
This proposal is only a specific part of a whole package of rehabilitation and restructuring measures.
It aims to create the legal framework to allow Community vessels receiving public aid for permanent cessation to be transferred to countries affected by the tsunami, rather than being scrapped or reassigned for non-profitable purposes other than fishing.
The intention is to make fishing capacity available in order to allow for a quick return to the activities on which the livelihood of countless coastal communities is completely dependent.
We have taken particular care to ensure that the local needs are carefully assessed.
In this respect, the role of FAO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, is decisive for the implementation of the rebuilding efforts in the area.
This is on the agenda for the next FAO meeting of fisheries ministers in Rome on 12 March.
Two main guiding principles have determined our approach in this proposal.
Firstly, a strong commitment to ensure consistency with the general objectives of the common fisheries policy and promote sustainability of the fishing activities in the long term.
To achieve those objectives, we have proposed technical assistance to make an immediate impact assessment and design of the rehabilitation and reconstruction requirements for the areas concerned.
In this respect, a monitoring system will be set up in order to avoid possible adverse effects on the local economy and to ensure that the vessels transferred meet the needs identified by FAO.
In addition, we have also emphasised that the transfers must be in accordance with the third countryâs requests and that they respect the local fishing traditions.
Secondly, the European Community must offer a mechanism making it possible to act swiftly, while establishing an effective monitoring and control system without imposing unnecessary administrative burdens.
The present proposal respects these constraints.
Indeed, the proposal will not require reprogramming in the Member States under the current structural regulation for the fisheries sector.
It has the further advantage that there are no financial consequences for the Community budget.
I would underline the political importance of this proposal.
Faced with an immense destruction of thousands of vessels, this proposal alone will certainly have only a limited impact.
The expected availability of suitable vessels, taking into account the principles of adaptability and sustainability, will allow us to meet only a fraction of the needs with this short-term measure.
Doubtless, this specific and focussed action will be followed by other actions in the humanitarian field to address the immense needs also of the fishing sector in the affected countries.
I can tell you that the Council has already discussed this proposal at a technical level and Member States' reactions are overall very encouraging.
I also welcome the amendments that were tabled by Parliament, which clearly has this issue very much at heart.
The Commission can accept a number of them.
Regarding the other amendments, I note that in many instances they are noteworthy in the sense that they go far beyond what this regulation may provide for and so, very regretfully, they cannot be taken on board as part of this regulation.
Their spirit, however, is undeniably driven by a clear commitment to alleviate the suffering brought on by the tsunami.
I hope that the European Parliament will give a positive opinion on this proposal to enable me to move this regulation forward in the Council next Monday, on 28Â February.
This will allow the Member States to make the necessary changes in their internal regulations so that, if the needs are indeed established by FAO, we will be able to act quickly and effectively.
Let me turn to the amendments.
The Commission can accept Amendment No 1.
On Amendment No 2: the Commission is in agreement with the spirit of this amendment, but it is somewhat misplaced and inappropriate to have such a reference to education and training since this aspect is not within the scope with respect to third countries.
However, I will be willing to make a declaration before adoption by Parliament later on, wherein the Commission will declare that appropriate training and educational measures towards fishermen in the countries hit by the tsunami should be encouraged and wherein the Commission will state its intention to provide an assessment of the needs, at the request of the third countries, through the expert facility which has been made available for the long-term rehabilitation of the fisheries sector in the affected countries.
On Amendments Nos 3, 18 and 19: again we agree with the spirit of these proposals, but the actions being proposed are provided for by the monitoring mechanism contemplated by the regulation.
Providing for such detailed and specific amendments within the text of the regulation itself could, however, have the affect of making the regulation cumbersome and too difficult to implement.
We are, therefore, of the view that there is no need for these specific amendments.
We can accept Amendments Nos 4 and 5.
On Amendment No 6: we have no problem with the substance and we are willing to look at this change with the Presidency and the Council and expect to be able to overcome legal and technical difficulties that may arise with introducing changes to a title at a late stage.
On Amendment No 7: there again we agree with the spirit, but we have difficulty in accepting the amendment because it goes beyond the scope of this regulation.
On Amendments Nos 8, 9, 11 and 21: again, we agree with the spirit, but we feel that this is not the place to address such wider issues relating to the humanitarian assistance programmes.
What this regulation enables us to do is to take a very concrete and specific action within the fisheries sector and more specifically within the FIFG regulation.
Other initiatives will follow, not only to meet the overall humanitarian needs but also for the fisheries sector, but unfortunately they cannot be addressed in this regulation.
On Amendments Nos 10 and 12: the coming into force of these amendments to Regulation 2792/99 cannot be made dependent to specific requests being made by affected countries.
I wish to point out that this regulation guarantees the participation of the third countries and I refer honourable Members to Article 1 of the current regulation, which amends Article 7 of the basic regulation, and which states that our actions are to be in accordance with the third countries' request.
On Amendments Nos 13, 14 and 15: we agree with the spirit of these amendments and we will take them up with the Presidency and the Council to see how best they can be reflected in the regulation.
On Amendment No 16: the regulation already provides in a number of instances for the assurance that fishing activity will be carried out in a sustainable manner.
We, therefore, feel that this amendment is already taken into account in the regulation.
We can accept Amendment No 17, but we would like to limit the scope of the action to small-scale fishing vessels, as defined in Article 3 of Council Regulation 2371/2002 (the CFP reform regulation).
On Amendment No 20: we feel that this point is sufficiently covered by the provision under which the vessels to be transferred should be for the benefit of the affected fishing communities, and so this amendment is not required.
On Amendment No 22: the Commission has difficulty accepting this amendment: whereas technically it may be sound, its scope clearly undermines the spirit with which the regulation is being adopted.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I know that the Commission proposal is based on the best of good intentions and we support good intentions in the wake of the awful tsunami disaster.
The trouble is that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
20 000 vessels under 12 metres in size were destroyed by the tsunami in the affected countries.
The Commission proposal is to send somewhere between 150 and 200 old, redundant vessels from the Mediterranean to help replace the 20 000 that were destroyed.
It is, as the Commission has pointed out, no more than a symbolic gesture.
It is nevertheless a very expensive symbolic gesture. The cost has been put at roughly EUR 9 million, with an additional EUR 400 000 to pay for transporting these vessels to the affected part of the Indian Ocean.
Therefore we are talking about roughly EUR 47 000 per vessel with the costs to be met entirely by Member States.
I am reliably told from experts on the ground in the Indian Ocean that replacement vessels of exactly the size required can be built for EUR 2 000 each.
For the same amount of money that we propose Member States should spend, we could build 3 500 fishing vessels.
This would be a much more meaningful response.
The Commission's response to the amendments tabled by the various groups this morning would nevertheless suggest that the entire focus remains on this regulation to transfer vessels.
I would suggest that the Commission refocuses and looks more closely at sending the things we can provide quickly, such as skilled experts, fishermen, carpenters, engineers, blacksmiths, boat builders, and the money to get people over there, as quickly as possible, to start rebuilding the kind of vessels they need to help replace the ones destroyed, instead of this nonsense of sending redundant, old, decrepit boats from the Mediterranean as a symbolic gesture.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the destruction of a huge number of boats has meant that an entire sector of the economy has been damaged.
Aid can come in many different guises, and one way in which emergency aid could be provided would be to transfer fishing boats that would in any case be taken out of commission in the European Union.
These boats could, then, be taken out of service in the European Union, but the victims of the tsunami in South-East Asia could reuse them if they wished and asked to do so; they would, indeed, be exactly what would meet their requirements.
In order to provide emergency aid in this way, however, amendments must be made to the legal framework currently in force.
Most of the members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament welcome this opportunity, which will remain open to us only for a short period of time, although we are obviously aware of the many problems it entails.
In our opinion helping people to help themselves is always the better option in the long term, and this should be apparent from our amendments.
Yet we view this proposal as a political sign of solidarity, and will support it accordingly.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, the groundswell of solidarity provoked by the tsunami disaster on Boxing Day may have been even greater among the seafaring community, which is more aware than others of its consequences for populations most of whom lived from the seaâs resources.
That is why, in response to this, Parliament, in its 13Â January resolution, asked for an examination of the possibility of sending to the communities affected anything that might be of assistance to them, including boats.
That is why Commissioner Borg and his services went to see things for themselves and are now asking us to approve the regulation authorising these potential transfers.
As Mr Stevenson has just said, this announcement has stirred the feelings of some of my fellow Members, who are alarmed at the idea that Europe was in this way going to salve its conscience by simply sending its old vessels to people who would have no use for them and who would thereby be deprived of the resources essential for getting their economies going again.
Obviously, that is not what the Commission intends, since it has sent the necessary experts to look at how to reconstruct the devastated countries in the medium and long term.
Authorising the transfer of a few dozen vessels suitable for the needs of the local populations and therefore requested by their authorities is therefore a short-term measure, one for the next few months.
As you know, these vessels will be less than 12m long and must be less than 20 years old.
Before approving the Commissionâs draft, as I hope we will, Parliament wanted, by means of a number of amendments, to clarify the terms for this transfer which, in particular, will not be made until the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has completed the study you mention, Commissioner.
The FAO has the necessary expertise and authority and is responsible for coordinating aid from all over the world.
The amendments also seek to introduce new recitals to make clear that this is obviously in addition to the funds granted for the reconstruction of the sectorâs industries and infrastructures.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, let us first agree that everyone wants to provide aid as quickly as possible, as effectively as possible.
It is a nice idea to export old fishing vessels, but it would not work.
This is a clear case of the emperorâs new clothes.
Everyone can see that the idea would not work, but no one dares to say so publicly and to scrap the proposal.
The FAO has not received any request for boats.
On the contrary, both Indonesia and SriÂ Lanka have declined such offers.
In addition, a conference of regional fishing organisations met last week in Sumatra, with representatives from all the countries affected. They oppose the export of old vessels.
They would rather have assistance in building up their local shipyards and fishing fleets. That is what we must help them with.
At all events, our amendments are aimed at reducing the risk of this export of boats destroying sea beds and the local economy and damaging fish stocks with the wrong kind of equipment.
I hope that the Commission acts on its good intentions, but its voting recommendations could have been more generous.
Is there anyone from the Council â yes, the Council â in this House?
Can you see that the emperor has no clothes and scrap this proposal?
Forget about prestige, and see things not from a European perspective but from the point of view of those affected.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, at first glance, this proposal to send surplus EU boats to the disaster-hit areas, where so many vessels have been destroyed, seems an extremely good idea.
On further consideration, however, all of the difficulties come to mind and, on still further reflection, the question arises as to whether the proposal would create more problems than it would solve and, ultimately, of whether the costs might not outweigh the benefits.
Firstly: what would be obtained in return for the money?
If an amount similar to the total cost were spent on manufacturing boats locally, the benefit to local fisheries would be many times greater.
It would also have the effect of supporting the local economy and the local shipbuilding industry, which need support in this emergency.
Secondly: the practicalities.
Is it really so practical to collect these boats and transport them to the region?
How should we handle distribution and allocation?
Thirdly, there is the matter of ecology.
Completely different kinds of fishing are involved, different kinds of equipment are used and different catches are fished for.
Sending a completely different kind of boat from those traditionally used in the area would be in danger of making fishing less sustainable and less environmentally friendly.
Fourthly: do the countries intended as recipients of these boats really want them?
The answer to this question is, of course, the one we have received from the UN body FAO, which coordinates such matters: âno, they do notâ.
No request for these boats has been received; instead, the countries concerned want to be able to build their own boats, using their local traditions and their local techniques.
Having considered and twice re-considered this proposal, it becomes quite clear that it was a good idea but one that, on closer reflection, should be abandoned.
It could undoubtedly be improved by adopting the amendments, especially those by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. This would make it a better proposal.
Most sensible of all, however, would no doubt be for the Commission to understand the situation, withdraw the proposal and instead try to persuade the Member States to provide at least equivalent sums for increasing the number of boats locally in the countries hit by the disaster.
That would bring greater benefit to those we all wish to help, that is to say the victims of the terrible tsunami disaster.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Boxing Day saw one of the worst natural disasters of modern times.
Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives, millions lost close relatives or their livelihoods.
The historically unparalleled demonstration of solidarity and generosity with which the rest of the world responded constituted a ray of hope in the middle of this tragedy.
The fishing industry was hit particularly hard by the tsunami.
In many cases, the survivors lost their boats, which are the tools upon which their livelihood depends.
The proposal to help countries hit by the tsunami by giving them vessels from the EU is therefore morally commendable, but the measure would be a drop in the ocean, making the proposal almost absurd.
A far better alternative would be to buy boats, suited to local purposes and needs, in the countries affected and in other neighbouring countries.
This would also give the local economies a very badly needed boost.
Nor is it obvious what constitutes the EUâs role as an international player in such contexts.
There is a tendency for forces within the EU to use disasters to advance their own positions.
New EU authorities, programmes and measures are proposed, and anyone questioning this development appears disloyal at this particular moment in history.
Often, the truth is, however, that, in such situations, the EU Member States should coordinate financial and material resources through other international bodies, principally within the framework of cooperation with the UN.
One example of this would be the urgent development of an early warning system, of the kind already in place in the Pacific, for tsunami disasters in the Indian Ocean.
I object to the use of international tragedies for the purpose of giving the EU new powers.
The EUâs powers must be discussed under normal conditions and in the context of the principle of subsidiarity, and not determined by quick decisions in disaster situations.
The European peoplesâ support for global solidarity should not be abused with a view to undermining the principle of subsidiarity.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the great options for European aid for the countries affected must be mobilised as soon as possible and, as you have acknowledged, this Parliament has done its duty by approving the urgent procedure.
Nevertheless, we also believe that it is important to do things quickly, but to do them well.
In this regard, we can only applaud the fact that humanitarian aid is being directed towards the fishing sector in question, but we believe that opting exclusively for the transfer of vessels is not the most appropriate approach.
The Commissioner says that she agrees with the spirit of many of the amendments; we would have liked the Commission to have presented a full package of measures to alleviate the problems faced by this sector and we believe that the method presented is not appropriate, since it has been rejected by the NGOs working in the area, which have received this proposal with great reservations.
The FAO itself has stated that our good intentions may aggravate the problem rather than resolve it and, as far as I know, two countries have said that they do not want ships to be sent, and some of them have extreme restrictions such as, for example, the prohibition of fishing by vessels of more than 10 horsepower.
It is therefore not sufficient simply to ensure that we do not send large vessels, as the proposal states, but rather we must send appropriate vessels to the area, which are designed to anchor at shallow beaches and are made with materials which are resistant, amongst other things, to high tropical temperatures and humidity.
There is a further problem, that of funding, and we had been promised it would be resolved.
In this case, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said, there is no extra funding, which means that this burden is going to affect countries at the expense of an FIFG which has already been promised to them, and I very much doubt that this proposal can be at all effective.
For all these reasons, we would ask that the amendments which have been presented by the majority of these groups, which we have all signed and which we are going to support, and which propose other alternatives and furthermore propose accepting the European Commissionâs proposal, be seen as a political message from this Parliament to the European Commission and the Council, and I hope it will become effective over the coming weeks.
Â Â  â Mr President, two months have passed since the tsunami tragedy.
These two months must have been the most terrible eternity for the many thousands of human beings who have lost not only their families, their homes and their communities, but have also been deprived â and unfortunately remain deprived â of their only means of subsistence, especially those whose livelihood was fishing.
The proposal tabled by the Commission is therefore a welcome one and should be adopted by Parliament once the proposals for improvement, tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and other parliamentary groups, have been incorporated.
The proposal must, however, be assessed realistically and in terms of its actual scale.
In other words, it should be viewed as a limited, short-term solution that is little more than symbolic, bearing in mind that thousands of boats were destroyed and it is unlikely that this action will help to replace more than a few dozen vessels.
In addition, doubt has also been raised as to the suitability of the vessels for their intended purpose, and the logistics of the proposal are becoming complex and costly, especially when it comes to transporting the vessels.
The initiative does have the merit, however, of demonstrating that the EU has not turned a blind eye to this aspect of the tragedy.
Yet solidarity will only be effective if we go further, that is, if adequate funding is granted for building and rebuilding vessels , especially small boats and traditional tools that are appropriate for local fishing methods.
The funding in question can be secured by removing part of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance from the appropriations allocated to each Member State.
To sum up, the Commissionâs proposal should not be subject to demagogical criticism simply because it falls short of what is needed.
Our primary objective is to do everything we can to bring it up to speed.
Â Â  â Mr President, this is a very difficult one to call.
No one begrudges help to the people affected by the tsunami.
Parliament, in its resolution on the tragedy, made special mention of those engaged in fishing, calling on the Commission to examine ways in which tangible aid in the form of vessels, gear, technical expertise and raw materials can be directed towards the affected communities.
But there have been too many examples in the past of well-intentioned aid being left to rot because it was not suited to local conditions, or because there was not the wherewithal or the expertise to make use of it.
If decommissioned vessels are to be exported, this must be under stringent conditions as to suitability, processed in accordance with the full assessment of needs, only upon request by the country concerned and accompanied by appropriate assistance.
Because of concerns about distortions of local economies and the depletion of fish stocks, we also seek some further reassurances.
First, about where the ownership of vessels will rest and second that this is purely an emergency measure and will not open the back door to a wider export scheme.
Given such reassurance, and on the understanding that both the Commission and the Council will take our reservations seriously, it is possible to support the proposal.
The Commissioner has made some commitment in this regard, but I am disappointed by the reluctance to incorporate much by way of amendment into the regulation itself.
I would urge the Commission and the Council to take a much more comprehensive approach to rebuilding fishing communities.
The swift commitment of support to projects like that offered by the Maritime Rescue Institute in Stonehaven, Scotland, is just one example, and it is much more directly in tune with Parliament's earlier call.
Â Â  â Mr President, it can sometimes be difficult to explain to European tax payers, our constituents, why it makes sense to use their money in order to destroy vessels that may well be seaworthy and which could be used in some way, even for non-fishing purposes.
However, that does not mean that these vessels are suitable for use in any area.
The more I have looked into the actual situation in the tsunami-hit countries, the more sceptical I have become about the value of this particular proposal.
It may be a symbolic gesture and it may be that a small number of vessels could be used or converted, but I do not think that will be of major assistance to areas that were devastated.
I support the amendments tabled by the various groups.
I very much regret that the Commission has not agreed to support them.
If this proposal is adopted in some way by the Council, I believe that the amendments would bring about very considerable improvements, not only to in a practical sense, but to its intention and spirit.
A measure such as this should be looked at as an enabling measure; not to enable Member States to actively offload unsuitable vessels to the these countries, but to enable those countries that have been affected to request certain vessels to be transferred to their areas if they are suitable for use or conversion.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, every once in a while the world is hit by a major natural disaster.
We are incapable of either predicting or preventing such disasters, and they act as a reminder of how insignificant we are in the face of nature.
They also remind us that animals are sometimes better at sensing danger and preparing to face it than we are.
This should act as a warning to us all against feeling too clever, too overconfident and too sure of our own omnipotence.
There is a force more powerful than we are, and from time to time it humbles us and reminds us of our insignificance.
The rest of the world responded to the tsunami disaster by making extremely generous donations, whether on an individual, governmental or institutional basis.
The question that must be asked, however, is whether we will succeed in putting these donations to appropriate use, and whether we will succeed in getting them to where they are most needed.
Immediately after the disaster, there was a lack of everything, including water, food, tents and blankets.
The world already has a certain amount of experience in the rapid provision of such items, and aid reached the victims quickly.
The provision of long-term aid is a different story, though, and another opportunity for us to be reminded of our own small-mindedness.
Jackals tend to appear wherever money is involved, with the sole aim of snatching something for themselves. This gives rise to a number of problems, such as the way in which the money should be shared out, what should be rebuilt first, which institutions or parties should be used to transfer the money and who can be trusted.
The tsunami destroyed the coastal and seaside economy.
The tourist industry was hit hardest, including the sex tourism industry, for which many of the regions devastated were renowned, but the fishing industry was also hit.
The question is whether, and to what extent, money that people have been generous enough to donate should be used to rebuild the sex tourism industry, with its escort agencies, massage parlours and brothels.
We must also ask ourselves whether we will succeed in reassuring those who have donated money that their money will not be used for such purposes.
Today we are debating a proposal to transfer fishing boats to fishermen whose livelihoods were destroyed by the tsunami.
This is the best possible form of assistance that could be provided.
In the European Union we pay fishermen to scrap their boats.
Surely, if the boats are still seaworthy we should instead give them to fishermen in the areas hit by the tsunami disaster who have lost their own boats?
Provided the costs of transferring fittings for these boats and other related costs are not too high, aid should be targeted at such measures.
We can be confident that donors will be happy with such an arrangement.
The proposal deserves our support, but it is only a drop in an ocean of needs.
We should do more, by allowing aid to be used to build fishing boats that meet the specific needs of the tsunami victims.
We would then be confronted with the familiar problem of who should benefit from these orders and from being paid to build the boats.
The countries hit by the tsunami should be the ones to benefit wherever possible, with donor countries taking second place.
At the same time, those who build the boats must agree to forsake their profit, and to earn only a minimal amount of money.
We should also rebuild other branches of the coastal industry destroyed by the tsunami, such as the shellfish farming industry, but we should take care to ensure that aid is not granted to the tourist industry, in particular the part of it that preys on human weakness.
I thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commissionâs laudable desire to transfer Community vessels, which would otherwise be scrapped, to the Asian countries affected by the tsunami disaster is all to its credit.
It is only right that the European Union should show solidarity when major natural disasters occur.
All the same, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my concern here about measures of this kind.
There is a real risk that the vessels sent to the Asian countries will be suited neither to those countriesâ fishing habits nor to their environment.
Worse, they could be a source of pollution.
Let us not add to the tragedy of the tidal wave that of seeing unsuitable vessels abandoned to pollute those countriesâ coastlines.
My other concern is about the cost of transport.
The European Commission estimates that transferring fishing vessels from the European Union to the countries affected by the tsunami will cost around EUR 50Â 000 per vessel.
In that case, would it not be better to give that money directly to the countries concerned, which could then build far more boats that are in keeping with their traditions, especially since the NGOs that are in contact with the fishermen have told us they can build a vessel for around EUR 1Â 200?
That is why I believe that two essential conditions must be satisfied for Europeâs action.
The request for the transfer of shipping vessels must come from the Asian countries themselves; it would in fact already appear that neither Indonesia nor Sri Lanka wish to receive any.
Moreover, the FAO has not received any requests for this kind of transfer.
I am also convinced that the transfer of the vessels must only be one part of our efforts.
Community humanitarian aid funds must also be mobilised for the reconstruction of the fishing sector.
Aid could for example take the form of sending experts and fishermen to help with the rebuilding of the local fishing infrastructures.
The FAO report we are expecting at the beginning of March will be crucial in determining the strategy to be followed by the Community.
Â Â  â Mr President, we were all shocked by the physical and emotional devastation wreaked by the tsunami across south-east Asia on Boxing Day 2004.
It will be some time before the full extent of the loss and damage suffered by the fishing industry is known.
But severe losses and/or damage to fishing vessels of all types have been reported from countries affected by the tsunami disaster, in particular Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and India.
Sri Lanka, for instance, has lost nearly 70% of its entire fishing fleet, according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.
Most of the fishing in the area is carried out by thousands of small boats of around 4.8Â m in length.
As well as the loss of fishermen's lives and boats and gear, harbours, production plants and freezing plants all suffered extensive damage.
Normal fishing activity cannot resume without intervention and investment.
Understandably, we want to help.
The urgency before us today relates to transferring vessels from EU Member States to countries hit by the tsunami.
The proposal has been strongly criticised, as we hear this morning, as being inappropriate because the climate and fishing practices of EU countries vary from those of south-east Asia.
I can understand why concern has been expressed over how suitable EU boats may be for fishing in south-east Asia.
However, I welcome the proposal before us today on the basis that it allows for the transfer of boats that meet the restricted criteria and that might be useful.
I also welcome amendments tabled on behalf of the PSE Group by Mr Kindermann, both singly and jointly with other groups, in particular the amendments that ensure that adverse effects on fisheries resources and the local economy are avoided, that the transfer is accompanied by any appropriate training, that boats are suitable and that the transfer meets the requirements of the FAO's needs assessments and is requested by the third country.
On that basis, I am happy to support the urgency and I call on colleagues to do likewise.
Â Â  â Mr President, well-intentioned initiatives can sometimes have the wrong consequences.
