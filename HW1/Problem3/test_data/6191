I feel that, from a spiritual point of view, this is one of the elements which contribute to the greatness of Christianity and make it a universal point of reference.
I would like there to be further debate on this.
Mr President, the Convention method as a method of implementing treaty changes is something quite new.
Success has been achieved in the main aim of broadening the EU debate and bringing the negotiations out from behind the closed doors of dusty meeting rooms.
We who had hoped, however, that the EU would fully move on from the stage of being a technocratic union and become a genuine democracy based upon a common European debate have reason to be somewhat disappointed.
There are too many ground rules and too many exceptions to the norms.
I nonetheless hope that this outcome will lead to a strengthening of the EU's competitiveness, something that is crucial.
The next Convention must take up the loose threads that have been left dangling.
Anyone who wants to see what this Convention really entails must read between the lines in analysing the outcome.
Among the issues that will be on the table for the next Convention are foreign policy - a clear example of a loose thread - as well as merging the jobs of the two executive presidents into one and continuing to develop the Council into a second chamber.
This constitutional treaty is really not the EU's last treaty change.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights, devised at the time of the last treaty change, was not introduced then but has been incorporated now.
That is the way the EU process operates.
Exceptions to the normal decision-taking model in this Convention must be taken care of at the next Convention.
The trend is nonetheless in the right direction, so the compromise must remain in place.
Influence on the part of the people has, in spite of everything, been significantly strengthened.
This may get to increase, but it may never ever decrease.
That concludes the debate.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
The Communist Party of Greece is opposed to the introduction of a European constitution because it will strengthen the imperialist ?U at the expense of the peoples and for the benefit of the exploiters.
In addition, the text of the Convention, which was set up and operated utterly anti-democratically by muzzling every voice on the left, does not crystallise the democratic rights won by the people.
On the contrary, it diminishes them.
The declaration of faith in an exceptionally competitive social (!) market economy also sets capitalism on a constitutional basis.
The abolition of the revolving presidency, the composition of the Commission, the cutback in unanimous decision-making and the definition of the qualified majority show that this is about redistributing power for the benefit of the strong and handing over more national sovereignty to the imperialist, Euro-unifying centre.
Militarisation is being dangerously deepened within the framework of the common defence policy which, of course, respects the obligations which derive from the North Atlantic Treaty.
Terrorism is being used as a pretext for creating preconditions for new military interventions against the peoples of the whole world (without forgetting the 'enemy within') and a special role is being reserved for Member States with high military capabilities.
It is no coincidence that the only minister is for foreign affairs.
We are convinced that the peoples will not be deceived.
Opposition to capitalism is growing, both inside and outside the ?U. The grass-roots fight will strengthen as the anti-grass roots policy intensifies and will pull down the edifice being so carefully erected.
Every effort has been made to portray the Convention as a highly democratic body, on the point of preparing a Constitution which will replace the Treaty.
The fact is, however, that this is not quite the case in terms either of the Convention's procedures or of its membership.
The Convention did not include representatives of all political parties, only the larger ones.
From the Assembly of the Republic (the Portuguese parliament), the Socialist Party (PS) and Social Democratic Party (PSD) participated in the Convention.
The positions of these parties are identical to those which dominate Community policy, insofar as they defend federalism and neo-liberalism.
Other political groupings, critical to a greater or lesser degree of such models and approaches, were excluded.
That makes it clear what kind of democracy is being upheld here.
It is true that the Convention has no constituent powers and cannot alter the Treaties, although that is what extreme federalists would like.
The latter believe that a few dozen people, far from their countries and the problems and rights of their peoples, may be more easily swayed by the interests of economic and financial elites in the powerful countries which dream of ruling Europe.
Only the Intergovernmental Conference and the national parliaments, however, will be able to alter the Treaties.
It is true that the results of the Convention do not exactly coincide with its stated aim of paving the way for ever-deeper integration.
The plan - albeit a dangerous one - is to take shorter strides.
I should like to welcome as official visitors to the House today a delegation from the Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy of the Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran, led by the Chairman of that committee, Dr Mohsen Mirdamadi.
We welcome you as guests for our debates on the Middle East and EU security strategy.
The next item is the statements by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission on the Middle East.
Mr President, it is a great pleasure once again to be able to participate in this plenary session of the European Parliament to discuss issues which are essential to the European Union and to the World in general.
I would like to join the President in warmly welcoming the representatives of the Iranian Parliament, headed by the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Mirdamadi, with whom I had the opportunity to meet yesterday and have a wonderful conversation on topical issues, issues which we will have the opportunity to discuss this afternoon.
I would like to begin with a few brief words on the situation in the Middle East, Mr President, which, despite the rays of hope we have seen over recent days, is still extremely difficult.
We must be aware that every possible effort should be directed towards initiating the peace process, which is unfortunately not being implemented, although there have been moments of hope in recent hours and recent days.
The Roadmap, which was produced by the Quartet, has finally been accepted by both sides, by Palestinians and by the Israeli Government.
As you know, in recent days there have been certain very important meetings, one in Sharm El Sheik, in Egypt, and another important one in Aqaba, where three speeches, the speech by the President of the United States, the speech by Prime Minister Sharon and the speech by Prime Minister Abu Mazen, had the air of very important declarations.
Unfortunately, that moment, which seemed as if it would lead to certain positive results, we have seen, if not die away, at least pass through a difficult phase as a result of the resurgence of violence in the occupied territories and in Palestine.
As you know, immediately after the meeting in Aqaba, acts of violence took place, terrorist actions and responses to them, creating the unstoppable spiral which we have unfortunately been witnessing for so long.
On the positive side, I would highlight the Quartet meeting on Friday of the envoys to the region, headed by Mr Moratinos representing the European Union, which has been positive and which will allow us to hold a new meeting on Sunday of the Quartet in Amman, which will be attended by its principal leaders.
The aim of this meeting will be to consider how we can continue to promote the process which was opened up following the meetings in Sharm El Sheik and Aqaba, which led to the approval of the Roadmap by both sides.
The Roadmap must be applied.
If the international community is not able to do everything possible to see that the Roadmap is applied, we will be faced with the same failure that we faced when the Mitchell Plan was presented, or when the Tenet Plan was presented.
Till now we have been able to produce sensible documents, documents which were full of hope, but which, unfortunately, the parties have not been able, with the help of the international community, to implement.
The fulfilment of the Roadmap must be our objective and the international community must make every possible effort to achieve that.
At the moment, as you know, two types of negotiation are underway, a negotiation which we could call 'intra-Palestinian' and another between Palestine and Israel.
At the moment, it may be that we are once again seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.
You are well aware of the intra-Palestinian negotiation.
It is taking place between Prime Minister Abu Mazen and the factions which have rejected the Roadmap and which have not supported the statements made in Aqaba.
There is a negotiation with the political leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the hope of reaching a ceasefire agreement soon, not a short ceasefire but rather one which really allows the more political aspects of the Roadmap to be implemented.
Secondly, there is a negotiation between the Palestinian Authorities at the moment, headed by the Interior Minister, Mohamed Dahlan, and the Israeli authorities, with a view to achieving an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, or at least from part of it, and the leaders of the Palestinian Authority fully taking up their security responsibilities.
If this were to be agreed, it would have consequences for all of us; we would also have to make an effort to help the Palestinian Authority, from an economic point of view, so that it could rapidly restore and construct at least a part of its security infrastructure.
Finally, Mr President, I believe that the control of this process is absolutely fundamental to the application of the Roadmap.
If there is nobody on the ground able to give their opinion, to analyse and to observe how this process is developing, I believe it will be very difficult to move forward and to achieve a good result.
We are being offered an opportunity to bring this process to a successful conclusion, and you know that the objective would be defined by the existence of two states, two states which could live together in peace, and within a regional context, with which all the other countries of the region could establish diplomatic and other types of relationship.
On Monday, in Luxembourg, the General Affairs Council met in the morning with the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority, a friend of many of us, Nabil Shaat, and in the evening we received the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Minister.
As the honourable Members will imagine, we are working in close cooperation with all the countries of the region in order to try to ensure that the opportunity offered by the Roadmap leads to a good result.
A few days ago I had the opportunity to travel to all the countries of the region for the preparation of the Luxembourg Council, and I can tell you that there is a great desire for the application of the Roadmap to begin; and at the same time there is a great fear that, if this opportunity is missed, we may have missed the final opportunity to find a peaceful and lasting solution which puts an end to the frustration and suffering of so many people over so long.
Therefore, to stop the violence, to stop the selective assassinations, are things which we must achieve amongst all of us so that we can implement the Roadmap.
Please allow me to make a couple of comments while the President of the Iranian Foreign Affairs Committee is present.
As I said, yesterday I was able to hold a good conversation with him, but I would also like to say that on Monday a statement was made in the External Relations Council, of which I hope all the honourable Members are aware, on relations between Iran and the European Union.
I would like to say to our Iranian friends, who are here with us this afternoon, that the European Union sees Iran as a great country. It is a great country with which we want to have solid relations, with which we are involved in serious negotiations with two approaches, one of an economic nature and one of a political nature.
It is the political aspect which affects me most directly.
It has to do with human rights, with the renunciation of support for any form of terrorism and with the nuclearisation of the Republic of Iran.
The honourable Members will be aware that the International Atomic Energy Agency, through its Director-General, Mr ElBaradei, whom many of us know, has been making certain clear statements on the behaviour of Iran and how it should behave in order to comply with the appeals and suggestions of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
As I said yesterday with all respect and affection to the President of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the European Union believes it is absolutely essential that our Iranian friends sign the additional protocol.
There is absolutely no reason for them not to do so.
Furthermore, our Iranian friends should not ask for anything in exchange, to sign the additional protocol is something which is in line with what countries such as Iran and the countries making up the European Union want: a world in which there is no proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and a world in which energy is used for peaceful purposes in a manner which is controlled by the organs of the United Nations, and therefore, to sign, to comply with all the requirements of United Nations, seems to us to be absolutely fundamental.
Our hope and desire is that the good sense of the Iranian authorities and people will mean that this demand, which we Europeans are making in good faith, becomes a reality as soon as possible.
They must sign the additional protocol and they should do so without expecting anything in exchange other than to continue constructive and positive relations with their friends in the European Union.
In this first speech I have been asked to give you some brief information about Operation Artemis, the operation currently being carried out by the European Union in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the region of Ituri and more specifically in the city of Bunia.
I would like to say that this is the first military operation the European Union has carried out without the assistance of any other organisation.
It is the exclusive responsibility of the European Union.
It is an autonomous operation requested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan, who contacted me a few days ago to find out whether the European Union would be prepared to commit itself to an operation of this nature.
The operation is not easy. It is complex, and therefore everything possible has been done so that it may fulfil its objective and so that the European Union may complete this commitment with its head held high and having implemented a resolution of the United Nations Security Council.
I would like to point out that, immediately after responding to the Secretary-General that the European Union was prepared to carry out this task, the Security Council approved Resolution 1484 which defines the limits of this mission both in terms of space and in terms of time.
But I would like to insist that in a genuinely record time, in less than two weeks from the first contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the European Union has been able to implement a whole complex operational set-up for the first military peace-keeping operation carried out by the European Union autonomously in Africa.
I am glad to be able to say this, because many people in the Council, the Commission and the General Staff of the European Union have worked day and night producing high-quality documents which have allowed forces to be deployed in absolutely record time.
And in relation to this thought, I would like to point out that we are midway through 2003. At the beginning of 2000, following the meeting of the European Council in Helsinki, we were asked to put ourselves in a position in 2003 or at the end of 2003 to be able to carry out peace-keeping operations of a military or civilian nature.
I believe we can all be proud, Parliament, the Council, the Commission, all the citizens of Europe, of the fact that halfway through 2003, the European Union is currently committed to three peace-keeping operations: one in Bosnia, as you know, continuing operations begun by the United Nations, another in Skopje taking over an operation begun by the Atlantic Alliance and one currently in Ituri, an operation begun by the European Union which I hope can be completed by the European Union.
All of us who have participated, therefore, can feel somewhat satisfied and proud: Parliament, the Commission, the Council, our colleagues in the General Staff, of having managed in such a short space of time to implement three operations which we must feel proud of, and I believe that Parliament must feel this and that we must also communicate it to the European citizens: the European Union is still working ceaselessly, with all the resources and capacities at its disposal, to try to make the world we are living in fairer and better and to ensure that the European Union plays a significant role in it.
I would insist that Operation Artemis is going to be a difficult one.
The honourable Members are aware that a few days ago we began to deploy the force.
There are now 400 soldiers in the region.
The operation is being led by a French commander, and France will act as the framework-nation for the operation.
There are forces from many countries of the European Union, a significant proportion, but also from third countries, from Africa and from other areas of the world, such as Latin America, deployed as part of this operation led by the European Union.
In accordance with the mandates issued to us by the Secretary-General of United Nations, we hope that this transition can be made when this force leaves the region of Ituri; a smooth transition to a fundamentally African administration and to this end we are in contact with the leaders of southern Africa.
This operation in the Congo is not just a peace-keeping operation.
We want to help to keep the peace so that we can accompany the operation with intensive diplomatic action.
Since before the operation began and every day since it began on the 12th, I have maintained contact with the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the Presidents of the neighbouring republics, in particular Rwanda and Uganda, the countries which have been most closely involved with the region of Ituri in the north of the Congo.
In a few days time I will travel to the region to try to give diplomatic impetus to the situation which has now been going on for a long time.
As a result of this European Union cooperation we will perhaps be able to see the establishment of a provisional government in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and we may glimpse signs of peace in these regions where, while there is unfortunately so much poverty, suffering and misery, there is also so much wealth underground.
I would therefore like to thank, on behalf of all of us, the country which is heading this operation, France, and all the members participating in it including - as I have said - countries from outside the continent, and I would like to address very directly our friends in Canada, which has not had the least hesitation in involving its forces in an operation led by the Europeans.
Canada has demonstrated once again its affection and respect for the European Union and, more importantly, the fact that it has such a similar view of the world's problems as the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end this first speech here.
I believe I have left nothing out, but if I have, I am sure that everything will become clear when I reply to your questions.
. Mr President, the High Representative has just eloquently demonstrated how close hope and despair are in the Middle East.
Following the presentation of the Roadmap and the Sharm-el-Sheikh and Aqaba Summits, there seemed to be a much better chance for peace .
Alas, the ongoing violence is again putting this at serious risk.
We, the European Union - and much more so the peoples in the Middle East - cannot afford to lose the opportunity for peace which has been created by the Roadmap, small though it may be.
Now more than ever it is crucial that the Roadmap should be implemented without being taken hostage by extremists who do not want peace.
Despite the violence of last week I hope that Palestinians and Israelis, with support from the international community, will generate sufficient confidence to allow them to move forward.
We also need to reflect now on how we in the European Union could help on this.
I can see several areas where the European Union and the Commission, in particular, could make a useful contribution:
First we ought to continue supporting Palestinian institution-building and reform, as we have already done with a successful record in the past.
Secondly, we should contribute to the Roadmap's monitoring process and put pressure on Arab States to help dry up funds to extremist groups and to close the offices of those groups.
We should also press Israel to moderate its responses to the unspeakably atrocious suicide bombings which many Arab leaders have themselves condemned.
We will continue our concrete support to the reform process and will also assist the new Palestinian cabinet in achieving its ambitious goals.
In 2003, the Community will provide a EUR 132 million support package for Palestinian institutional reform and respond to the deterioration of the economic and humanitarian situation.
But clearly, the reform needs to go further in other areas as well: one that I have particularly pressed on Palestinian officials, even this week, is the judiciary.
We would also like to see elections held by the end of the first phase of the Roadmap.
The Commission has done a lot of work with the Palestinian authority, especially with the Finance Minister, Salam Fayyad, which I am pleased to say has led to a successful reform process.
This is by no means completed, and we therefore continue working closely with the Palestinian authority on reform conditions for our support during this year.
Minister Fayyad has confirmed that with our latest help he has succeeded in consolidating public-sector revenues and there is much greater budgetary transparency with monthly budget execution reports available, even on the Internet.
The reforms, together with external financial assistance, have allowed him to increase expenditure in Gaza and West Bank since the beginning of the year by meeting arrears and salary payments.
Boosting aggregate demand was, in his view, the most important contribution that could be made at this stage to alleviating the severe constraints on the Palestinian economy.
As a possible next step, easing restrictions on freedom of movement, including to Jordan and Egypt, would greatly help to revive economic activity.
Further progress is needed.
Next week, the European Union-Palestinian Joint Committee will be discussing all these issues.
We will also explore ways and means of making better use of the Interim Association Agreement.
As a member of the Quartet, the European Union will need to look at the monitoring mechanism.
All Quartet partners should be able to contribute.
The Commission is certainly ready to support this important work through our experience and activities in reform and institution-building, but also in the areas of economic and humanitarian issues.
There is another area where we in the European Union will need to step up our efforts: the request of the Roadmap for all Arab states to cut off public and private funding for the groups engaged in violence and terror.
We discussed this point at the Euro-Mediterranean meeting on Crete.
We encouraged Arab states to channel aid funds through the single account of the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Finance.
But we should use our partnership with Arab countries to address this extremely important point.
There are, however, issues that need to be dealt with urgently in the context of the Roadmap and together with the United States: for example, the rapidly expanding settlement activities and the so-called security wall which is biting into the West Bank.
Both undermine the envisaged two-State solution.
Equally worrying is the worsening humanitarian situation which is compounded by restrictions on humanitarian access.
These new measures have a negative impact on the operation of international donors and will make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to undertake humanitarian and development tasks.
We welcome, however, confidence-building measures on the Israeli side such as the removal of so-called illegal settlement outposts, the lifting of curfews, the release of prisoners and the provision of more work permits for Palestinians.
Additional proactive measures would help win the hearts and minds of the population and would reduce the attraction and influence of those who are so bitterly opposed to peace.
As I said before, we are willing to help but it is up to the Israeli and Palestinian parties to take the first step.
Without their political will and commitment nothing will change.
The killing will go on.
Let me just say a few additional words, following what the High Representative said about Iran and our relationship with Iran.
I welcome, as you did Mr President, a delegation from the Parliament in Iran to the official gallery here today.
I too have enjoyed discussions with them this week and, indeed, enjoyed discussions with them in Tehran.
Over the last year and more, we have made it clear to our interlocutors in Iran that we want to develop a sophisticated, comprehensive relationship with them; which recognises that Iran is a great pre-Islamic civilisation; which recognises Iran's enormous geo-strategic importance in the region and, indeed, in the world; and which recognises that the outcome of the debate on democracy in Iran is important not just for the region but for all of us.
It is a genuine debate and we watch it and listen to it with considerable interest.
We have started, as the House knows, a series of discussions with Iran.
We have three tracks of discussions: one on human rights, one on political issues such as the use, manufacture and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the third on trade and cooperation.
We have had two rounds of talks on the first two of those issues, three rounds of talks on the first two, and four rounds of talks on trade and cooperation.
The Council has always made it absolutely clear that progress on each of those tracks is interlinked, that we cannot make progress in one area without being able to demonstrate that we are making progress in others.
We can point to some progress.
We cannot, alas, point to as much progress as a result of the human rights dialogue as we would like, though we welcome, for instance, the agreement to allow thematic UN rapporteurs to return to Iran.
There has been considerable progress on the trade and cooperation agenda where there have been very good and thorough discussions on both sides.
I have to say that, on political issues, and in particular on the issue to which the High Representative drew attention - nuclear matters and the transparency surrounding Iran's nuclear programme - we have not enjoyed the progress that we would have like to have seen.
This is not a new point for us.
Every meeting I have had with any Iranian official - every meeting - has involved a call for Iran to sign the additional Protocol to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
It was a point that the High Representative and I made when we went to Tehran in the immediate aftermath of 11 September.
It was a point which, again, I made on a recent and extremely valuable visit to Tehran.
So this is not an issue to which the European Union has come recently.
It is not a question of us parroting other peoples' concerns.
These are real concerns for us and we want to see them addressed.
Iran is a sovereign nation and it makes its own decisions but I hope it will make decisions which will make it easier for it to get on with Europe, for it to get on with the rest of the world and for Europe to get on with Iran.
That is what we would like to see but this has to be a two-way process of engagement.
There has to be a recognition in Iran that when we talk about weapons of mass destruction we are deadly serious, not perhaps as deadly as the weapons, but certainly profoundly serious about what we want to see as the outcome.
Mr President, the acceptance by the different parties of the Roadmap has followed a tremendous wave of violence in the region and unfortunately this is a relatively normal and well-known pattern.
At times of hope there are always people whose extremism and radicalism lead them to commit acts aimed at undermining peace efforts.
However, the international community is now closely involved: the United Nations, the European Union - we must not underestimate the role of the European Union - the United States and Russia.
There is one fact which I believe to be irrefutable and that is that, since the beginning of the second Intifada, there have been more than 2 700 victims on the Palestinian side and almost 800 on the Israeli side.
In other words, everybody loses here: the Israelis lose their security and the Palestinians lose the possibility of economic and political development, in other words the possibility of well-being for its people.
The European Union is placing particular emphasis on increasing its diplomatic efforts, in order to ensure that - as Mr Solana has said - peace is based on the idea of two states, Israel and Palestine, living together in peace and security.
I believe it appropriate to state here, when we are on the point of voting on an important resolution on transatlantic relations, that we should be pleased to note that the United States are prepared, together with us, to make an effort to move the Roadmap forward; and I believe that the comments of the President of that country, following the latest acts of violence and terrorism in the region, are a guarantee of this.
It is time to move forward and to consolidate the achievements made, and to continue working on the basis of the application of the Roadmap.
It is urgent that the verification mechanism be established and made operational as soon as possible.
I believe that not only the United States but also the European Union and the United Nations have sufficient resources on the ground to begin this essential task and I believe that we Europeans must work with total pragmatism and realism in this area.
We must therefore celebrate the fact that the peace process now includes the very active participation of the international community, which is now accepted by everyone to be indispensable.
I believe that we Europeans are furthermore faced with two inescapable tasks: on the one hand, to give our full support to the Prime Minister, Abu Mazen, helping him to achieve the necessary trust of his people, of Israel and of the international community.
And therefore, Mr President, I believe it is very important for Parliament's Bureau to invite him here so that he can give us his impressions and share his views with this House.
The results of the meeting he held the day before yesterday with 13 organisations demonstrate the urgency of this task.
We must help him to convince the Palestinian population that the government he leads, under the presidency - we must not forget - of President Arafat, is in an historic position.
By the way, I would like to express my disapproval of the isolation which President Arafat is being subjected to, an isolation which I believe is of no use to anybody.
The second job I believe falls to us, and this was noted by this Parliament's delegation for relations with Israel, is the need to make an effort to restore the confidence of an Israeli society which lives in constant fear of terrorist attack.
On the issue of terrorism I believe this Parliament has been clear and firm, and we must continue to be so.
No type of terrorist act is justified; we cannot distinguish either between terrorists or between their victims.
I must not end, Mr President, without greeting and welcoming our colleagues from the Iranian Parliament and expressing my agreement with the words of the High Representative in relation to that country and, in particular, his request to the Iranian authorities.
Iran is indeed a great country with which this Parliament - as we all hope and wish - must strengthen its friendly relations.
Mr President, the publication of the Roadmap on 30 April offers a new opportunity to try to resolve a conflict which has led to seven wars in 50 years.
If you will allow me, I believe we must distinguish between the Roadmap, which is an itinerary, and the journey itself.
I would like to refer to a poem, which the High Representative will know well, by a great poet, Antonio Machado, who said that 'the path is made by walking'.
The Roadmap may exist on paper, but what we have to do is to create the whole path with an objective which, for the first time, the whole Quartet, and not just certain countries, recognise.
The international community believes that there must be a firm and definitive peace agreement based on the existence of two democratic and sovereign states, living together in peace within secure and recognised borders, and even accepting that, for the moment, a divorce may be better than living together.
I would also like to point out that this is achieved by moving forward together and not by vetoing.
And just as, in the previous debate, I criticised the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Sharon, did not receive the High Representative when he visited the Middle East, I also believe we must ask the next President?in-Office of the Council, the Italian Prime Minister, when he goes to the Middle East, not just to visit Israel, but also the Palestinian Authority.
Our strength lies precisely in our ability to talk to everybody.
I also believe we must stress elements which can help the Roadmap, the joint path, to move forward.
For example, the Palestinian Authority has taken steps: the reform of the Finance Ministry, the creation of the post of Prime Minister and the support of the Legislative Council.
We must not only talk about the Quartet, moreover, but also about those governments which, like Egypt, are making a very significant effort to contribute to the process moving forward, and above all to achieve, together with the Palestinian militia organisations, a break in hostilities; and I believe that the meeting of the Quartet in Amman on the 22 is an important step that we must support.
It is clear that Hamas must leave behind the use of indiscriminate violence and that we must appeal to it and consider including it on the list of terrorist organisations unless things change.
We must also ask the Israeli Government, which has the most strength in political, moral and military terms, to fulfil its part of the Roadmap, dismantling the illegal settlements in the occupied territories and putting an end to the policy of selective assassinations.
With regard to the steps which must be taken, I believe we must encourage perseverance.
We must also - and in this regard I would point out that Commissioner GÃŒnter Verheugen has just been in Israel - tell our Israeli friends that we are prepared to intensify our relations at all levels, as long as they also want to do so and are prepared to treat us as we deserve, particularly in view of the political will we have demonstrated.
With regard to this process, all we can ask for is perseverance, to seek the possibility of helping these two peoples to move forward together, and an immense dose of patience.
And in this regard, at a time when Ambassador Moratinos is on the point of finishing his mission, I believe it should be noted in the Minutes that this group thanks him, as does the whole of Parliament I hope, for the tireless work he has done over all these years.
And I would like to end, Mr President, with two brief references to two issues which have also been dealt with by the High Representative and by the Commissioner.
Firstly, our relations with Iran.
I can only say that the Socialist Group supports intensifying these relations, opening up a new stage of significant relations in the economic and political fields with a young but at the same time very ancient country, with a dynamic and vibrant country, which also wants to open up its society, as is currently being demonstrated by what is happening with the students.
We all have experience of the importance of student revolts and demonstrations; they are always an omen of what may happen within society, and I believe it is important to help Iran to find its way as a country.
Therefore, as well as signing up to the additional protocol of the Atomic Energy Agency, I also believe that we can contribute to increasing stability in the region, because we must point out that this region needs stability.
What it does not need are new points of conflict, because we are facing a multiplication of points of conflict from Afghanistan to the Mediterranean rim.
What we have to do in this regard is to put fires out and not generate new ones, and the role of Iran may be very important.
Finally, a very brief reference to Operation Artemis.
We Europeans have historic responsibilities in Africa and the step taken by the European Union in the Congo is a positive one.
Let us not forget that there are masses of conflicts.
We have the case of Liberia, for example, which is also currently experiencing civil war.
I believe that we in Parliament must dedicate all our resources to the European Union taking a step, which it has taken for the first time on its own, demonstrating that it has the capacity to re-establish normality in a continent to which it owes an enormous historical debt.
Mr President, if Hamas can continue to obstruct the Roadmap with violence, there will never be any peace.
The terror organisation rejects the two-State concept and wants to turn Israel into an Islamic state.
The spiral of violence will never stop if Israel continues to be provoked by the attacks.
The unlawful killing of leaders is, of course, an empty exercise if these are simply replaced.
An international military force must be set up as soon as possible, preferably after a file agreement, but if the latter does not materialise, we will have to make do without one.
Hamas should then be eliminated by an international military force, if possible in conjunction with NATO, so involving both European and Americans.
At the same time, all Hamas's financial lines need to be severed.
Israel and the Palestinians are thoroughly weary of the violence and misery.
Finally, under international pressure, a solution is gradually manifesting itself.
This is why the road must be blocked to anyone who is intent on more bloodbaths and no peace.
Their Roadmap is one to hell.
Mr President, there is no doubt that the Roadmap is a hope to which we must cling without allowing our political judgment to be clouded or losing our clear vision of the incidents taking place daily in Palestine and Israel.
There is no doubt that the European Union as a whole and the resolute, committed work of the special envoy, Mr Moratinos, have played a major part in drawing up the Roadmap and helping the Palestinian Authority to undertake the series of reforms laid down in the Roadmap, which - as we are quite aware - does not resolve all the issues but is certainly important.
Egypt too has played an active role.
It is essential, however, that the whole Quartet is involved and supports the talks.
It would be too great a risk and, in any case, a mistake to leave management to the USA alone.
At the same time, it is essential that we support the talks at all stages without recommitting the errors of the Oslo Agreement when, after the great handshakes, the two parties were left alone with very different power relations, with the result that violence and oppression prevailed instead of peace.
We are all aware, I regret to say, of the complicity and subordination of some European leaders in the face of the dominance of the US administration and of the tendency shown by the Israeli Government not to value Europe, Russia and the UN as interlocutors, considering them - wrongly - to be biased towards the Palestinians: wrongly in that it is a question not of bias but of not renouncing the law and justice.
In other words, the reality is that international law is not binding for some of these countries.
In any case, if it were, if the law were being respected, the issue of Palestine and Israel would have been resolved a long time ago, at least when the PLO opted in 1988 at Algiers to coexist peacefully with the State of Israel and to have its own state in the territories occupied in 1977.
The imbalance, symmetry and situation of Palestinians and Israelis, of occupied and occupiers, are not trivial considerations.
Quite the opposite: it is essential to stress that it is the Israeli army which is occupying: it is not the Palestinian Authority which is building settlements and holding Palestinians prisoner.
The utterly despicable terrorist acts against civilians are perpetrated by Palestinian extremists, not by an army duly equipped with weapons, although in saying this I am not absolving the Palestinian Authority of errors and weaknesses which have harmed the cause of a just peace.
The Roadmap offering a possibility of peace for both peoples is, once again, a challenge and a source of hope, but if we genuinely want Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace and security, we do, of course, need to call upon the Palestinian Authority to make every endeavour to stop the terrorist acts - and Abu Mazen, with the support of President Arafat, is pursuing the path of dialogue with great determination to stop the violence and prevent a civil war - but we must also call very strongly upon Ariel Sharon to comply with the initial stages of the Roadmap and bring to an end the targeted assassinations which seem to be intended precisely to provoke terrorist reactions.
Mr Sharon has said that three and a half million Palestinians cannot be ruled with military occupation.
Then let him act upon his words, as Gedeon Levi, a Ha'aretz reporter says.
Let him remove the checkpoints and stop the hunger and the demolition of houses, let the sick and nursing mothers have access to hospitals, let children no longer see their parents being beaten up or humiliated in the dead of night.
This will lend impetus to the peace process.
Then there is a monstrosity which Commissioner Patten mentioned too: the wall, the wall of separation, of apartheid, of annexing of territory.
It is eight metres high and 364 kilometres long, protected by barbed wire and with electronic controls.
The wall represents annexing of territory: 30 water wells seized, 16 Palestinian villages separated from cultivatable land.
Ariel Sharon has given orders for construction work on the wall to carry on even during the night, and 374 kilometres are not enough for him - the banks of the Jordan are to be cut off by the wall too.
We must exert pressure with the instruments we have to bring about the creation of two peoples and two states.
We support Kofi Annan's call, backed by the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, to send an international peacekeeping force to stop Palestinian and Israeli deaths.
It is already long overdue.
Mr President, Mr Solana, Mr Patten, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago, I was in Israel for the first time with this Parliament's official delegation to discuss Europe-Israel relations.
It was three years ago that a delegation had been there.
Our visit to, for example, the Knesset was very informative, and the hope was expressed of maintaining better relations in future.
Needless to say, the Roadmap was the topic of conversation.
During our visit, there were also terrorist attacks in Jerusalem which we condemned unequivocally, but the Roadmap remained, and Prime Minister Sharon eventually expressed his support for this plan.
Despite this, he continues to make matters worse by the army's campaign of slaughter in the occupied territories.
Something basic is missing from the step-by-step plan.
It is a process that requires external guidance, because mutual distrust is too entrenched.
The proposal to set up an international peace force is therefore a much-needed addition to the step-by-step plan.
The colour of the helmets is of lesser importance.
The Union has a role to play here, for we have an historic responsibility in this region that is so close to the Union.
The Union must claim a more prominent role in the Quartet, and I hope that this will happen under the Italian Presidency.
Cooperation with the United States will be important for the further development of transatlantic relations.
If the Union takes a united stand, we can play a key role.
For historic and humanitarian reasons, we owe it to ourselves to bring peace to that region.
Mr President, it is very hard to believe that since the historic meetings in Aqaba on 4 June 2003, 65 people have now been killed in what is a horrifying escalation of violence in the region.
That violence includes a Palestinian suicide bomb attack on a bus in Jerusalem and a number of Israeli attacks on members of Hamas carried out in densely populated civilian areas.
All right-minded people support the Roadmap for peace because this will ensure the creation of a future Palestinian State with territorial contiguity.
The Roadmap also calls for the immediate dismantling of settlement outposts erected since March 2001.
The Israeli authorities must seek to show restraint in response to these awful attacks and the Palestinian leaders too must press forward with their efforts to put an end to such atrocities.
We must all ensure that we encourage Hamas to return to ceasefire talks with the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mahmood Abbas.
It is vitally important that the parties proceed with the implementation of the Roadmap elaborated by the international community, and that each side fully meets their obligations under this plan.
Immediate implementation of the Roadmap is vital if one is to generate momentum for a peace settlement in the region.
However, the brutal violence of the last fortnight, and indeed over the last 33 months of the intifada, has deepened animosities and intensified emotional hatreds.
But we must seek to renew engagement between the Palestinians and the Israelis at all costs, and the European Union must play a central and pivotal role in this process.
I appreciate the difficulties that remain regarding the issues of refugees and settlements but I do call on leaders from both sides to stand firm in their support of the Roadmap.
If this process is to be a success, we must achieve progress along the political, economic and security tracks at all costs.
Finally, in relation to comments made by Commissioner Patten and by the High Representative Mr Solana in relation to the visiting Iranian delegation, I too am very pleased that this delegation is here this week, and I am very glad about the comments that have been made here today by both Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten.
As Commissioner Patten said, the agenda for the talks which are presently under way is a very serious European agenda and one that must be addressed before we can make progress.
Mr President, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo was allowed an extra minute and forty seconds over and above the speaking time initially allotted to him.
I hope that you will do the same with all of the speakers, including those like me - and I am not the only one - who found Mr Solana's contribution just now to be pathetic.
As far as the regional orders known as the 'Roadmap' are concerned, although we are not surprised that it has been shattered into a thousand pieces in recent days, we still want to point out that the cause of this is very simple: for us, as supporters of sovereignty, we cannot conceive of peace without sovereignty and without the freedom of nations in balance.
Without the balance of nations, there will be no peace.
Yet the entire United States policy consists of accentuating the imbalances: the global imbalances, of course, as this superpower no longer recognises any boundaries, but also the regional imbalances, and that, in relation to this issue on the agenda, is undoubtedly the most serious aspect of all.
Indeed, the entire United States policy consists of destroying all Arab powers when they emerge: it is very clear that that is the main reason behind its relentless attacks on Iraq, since it is a well-known fact that it does not want to see a modern and developed Arab power.
Its policy also consists of supporting the extremists on both sides, both the Israeli and the Palestinian extremists, at times using Machiavellian practices that are sinister when one dares to look closely at them.
Then, alongside that, there is this European policy - or at least there would be this European policy if Europe existed - that is actually the policy of France and consists of doing exactly the opposite, in other words supporting the moderates on both sides, both Israeli and Palestinian.
As I have said, that is the policy of France and I hope that if some day Europe manages to have some kind of influence over the events in that poor world, it will realise that it is the wisest path to take.
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is an ideology - correct me if I am wrong - which unites us, or you, all: considering Camp David, Oslo and the Roadmap, what is our goal?
Creating, in a territory which is smaller than Normandy or Belgium, which says it all - I am talking in terms of square kilometres, of course, for I would not be so impolite as to make other allusions - two states: two independent states, mind you, not one US state and one Russian state.
High Representative, the foreign, structural policy which we are pursuing there is exactly the opposite of the policy we have been committed to for 50 years with a view to the day - for pity's sake, it does not even occur to you because you are of sound mind, whereas I am a little nutty in the sense that I look forward to that day - when we can be citizens of the European Union without paying the price of being citizens of Italy, or France, or the United Kingdom.
Certainly not, you are concerned solely with the states.
We must resolve matters through states, by creating another Palestinian State.
Never mind the fact that there could be another state, the State of Jordan, which is already a larger, stronger, more democratic Palestinian state than we could possibly imagine your Palestinian State to be.
Your state, for pity's sake!
Then there is the problem of the Lebanon, but you are not concerned with anything beyond the fact that it is a state, never mind that it is a cover for Syria and everything which is most execrable in that region, in Mediterranean Switzerland.
High Representative, Commissioner Patten, I know that the evil is present here too, first and foremost, in Parliament.
We must fight alongside the antifascists and the anticommunists - with Altiero Spinelli, Ernesto Rossi and Robert Schuman, with those who conceived Europe not as a geographical entity but as the home of the law, of the Torah, of literature, of democracy - against national bureaucracies, inadequate as vessels of freedom, liberation and prosperity.
Now you are trying to impose this famous Roadmap.
I was in Jerusalem with our fellow Members and I said: 'The Roadmap?
A day, a week, a month?
Two Palestinian states?
All these Foreign Ministers, all these thieving, corrupt ministers?'
Yes, they are thieving and corrupt, as are many French, Italians, Germans, British and Americans; but there, corruption has another dimension: it is corruption of the body, of freedom, of the law.
We must not set them off along that road.
We must not encourage it.
Would the High Commissioner kindly spend a brief moment telling us about our European army, which has, at last, been sent to the Congo?
At last!
And under whose control have we placed it?
Focard's heirs!
I repeat: Focard's heirs!
We are entrusting peacekeeping in that area to those whose attempts at decolonisation have resulted in foul massacres which are worse than those of the colonial period.
I wish you luck, Mr President.
I wish you luck, fellow Members.
High Representative, Commissioner, I wish you luck.
We need it.
I look forward to the time when I, the Israelis and the Palestinians will have the right to citizenship which is not your or our prisons.
We want to be free in the law and in freedom.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a Rhinelander, I lack Mr Pannella's capacity for emphasis, but I would like to make a number of comments, just as strongly felt, on the speeches by the High Representative and Commissioner Patten.
The Roadmap is essentially a method which the European Union applies all over the world.
It is how we have shaped our enlargement process: by setting a goal and then providing support - both financial and political - for the stages along this road to enlargement.
I regret that in the past, this well-established European principle sometimes seemed to be forgotten or appeared suspect, for there was an impression that no matter how much terrorism there was, no matter how much intifada or violence occurred, we Europeans act as if nothing had happened and carry on paying and maintaining contacts with President Arafat.
It is a good thing that we have moved away from this.
It is a good thing that Commissioner Patten has transformed budget aid into project aid again, that he is now involved in the reform of the Palestinian Authority, that we have very close contacts to the Palestinian Finance Minister, that we say a resounding 'yes' to Prime Minister Abbas and give him our support, and that we meet rather less often and less vocally, perhaps, with Mr Arafat.
We do not need to isolate him, but we must make it clear where Europe's sympathies lie.
We may have been a little late in doing so.
Secondly, we are now making tougher demands of ourselves, and we should be making these same demands of the neighbouring countries as well.
Now that Iraq no longer has Saddam Hussein as a dictator and is hopefully on the way to more democratic structures, we must send a clear message to Syria and Iran.
The message is this: if you want to conduct relations with the European Union, you must say 'yes' to the Roadmap and participate in the process as well.
We have made this very clear to our Iranian colleagues over the last few days.
Maintaining good relations with the European Union while supporting Hizbollah is not an option.
Maintaining a close friendship with the European Union while funding, supporting and cultivating links with the offices of terrorist organisations is not an option.
I am therefore grateful to Commissioner Patten and the High Representative for stating this so categorically here today in plenary.
If Iran is willing - even in this very difficult situation, also in its relations with the United States - to improve its relations with the European Union, then it would say 'yes' to the Roadmap and 'yes' to a Palestinian state by 2005, but it would also say 'yes' to Israel's right to exist, for even now, this statement is not forthcoming from most of the Arab states who would like to be the European Union's partners.
If we were to receive such clear signals, this would strengthen the Middle East peace process as well.
That is the message to us in the European Parliament: despite all the setbacks, despite all the violence, we will make more demands, not only on ourselves but also on Israel's and Palestine's neighbours, and that includes both sides.
It also includes Prime Minister Sharon.
He must be told very clearly that there is no room for negotiation on the Roadmap.
That is the basis, and that is what we regard as the framework for the Middle East.
The settlements must be removed.
Here too, there are clear demands on everyone involved in this process.
In my view, this clarity has been missing to some extent from Europe's policies over the last two or three years.
We now have the chance to come back into the frame with the United States, Russia and the United Nations.
I believe this will give fresh impetus to the peace process.
Mr President, the timing of this discussion is quite important, given the fact that today's world our generation is living through the greatest revolution in history - telecommunications, technology and transport - as a result of which the world is a much smaller place.
For that very reason, influential countries like the United States, or many other countries, or indeed the European Union, are in a stronger position to shape that world because it is a smaller place.
For that reason it should be the primary objective of the new century that we use that influence to ensure that there will no longer be any wars or conflict.
This means that in practice we send our philosophy of peace and reconciliation to areas of conflict.
Of course, the best example of conflict resolution in the history of the world is the European Union: that is something that is hardly ever mentioned, and I often think is sometimes forgotten.
The first half of the century we just left was the worst in the history of the world: two World Wars, 50 million human beings slaughtered.
Who could have forecast that those same peoples, at the end of that century, would have come together in the European Union?
Therefore, the principles at the heart of the European Union, are principles that should be sent to every area of conflict - I know because the three principles of the European Union are the three principles that produced peace on my own streets in Northern Ireland: respect for difference, no victory and the creation of appropriate institutions.
Then, through those institutions, we can work together in our common interests and break down the barriers of the past.
I would like to see that philosophy of the European Union sent to all areas of conflict in the world, and for that reason the European Union should have a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation backed up by a substantial directorate, that could, instead of sending soldiers to areas of conflict, send a team that would promote dialogue.
The first message to the Middle East would of course be to get them to agree in advance that it is people that are divided there, not territory, because without territory even the Middle East is only a jungle, and when people are divided, they should agree that they can never solve their problems by any form of violence.
They can only do it by agreement and by sitting down to reach that agreement.
I believe there is a major opportunity now for the European Union to lead by example, to give leadership to the world and create a world of lasting peace.
Mr President, it was 4 June in Aqaba.
Ariel Sharon and Mahmoud Abbas were talking about peace, making pledges and embarking on the road marked out by the Quartet, a difficult road, without doubt, but one without any alternative.
Remarkable things were said.
The Palestinian Prime Minister referred to Palestinian terrorism, not political activism but the terrorism and suffering of the Jewish people.
The Israeli leader, for his part, confronting some of his cabinet, expressed his clear desire that two peaceful States should coexist side by side in order to end the suffering of the Palestinian people.
Europe and the United States must now use all their weight to ensure that this fragile window of opportunity, which opened slightly two weeks ago, does not close again on cruelly dashed hopes.
There have already been 50 deaths since this summit, affecting both sides, the most recent victim a seven-year-old girl killed yesterday evening by the violence of men.
Noam was Israeli, but that is not what is important here.
When a child dies, a part of each of us is extinguished.
So here, in such a short space of time, we have to say that Europe must make every effort to support the actions of these two men and to prevent the extremists on both sides from continuing to set fire to peace, so as to ensure that Aqaba does not become another Taba.
Mr President, there will not be the slightest beginnings of a peace process for the Palestinian and Israeli people until the political conditions for a just peace have been met.
The first of these conditions is the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army from the occupied territories.
However, neither Sharon nor Bush want that.
The first steps to implement the Roadmap are, it must be recognised, pathetic.
What is the dismantling of some caravans parked completely illegally compared with the aspiration of a people, with their legitimate right to a State?
The continued construction of a security wall, the continued atrocities, the continued policy of targeted assassinations say a great deal about Sharon's desire to persevere with his fatal logic.
This heightens the despair of the entire Palestinian people, but their determination to live in freedom within their own State remains intact and we must support this.
Indeed, the European Union cannot remain deaf to what is at stake in the Middle East today.
It has the political resources to act.
It is the final chance for the Council to decide at last to back the opinion of the European Parliament advocating a suspension of the association agreement with Israel until its forces withdraw from the occupied territories.
It is time for the UN to at last oblige the Israeli Government to apply the resolutions it has adopted.
Mr President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to touch upon three subjects in one and a half minutes - this will therefore be an extremely brief intervention.
In connection with Israel and the Palestinians, may I ask you to check whether the efforts are being requested from both sides?
I have noticed that the Palestinians have been put under extreme pressure.
I wonder whether pressure has also been brought to bear on Israel to start leaving the settlements, for that could defuse the situation and could be a clear signal that could take the wind out of the sails of the terrorists.
The Union must also exert actual pressure via the Association Agreement.
Mr Patten mentioned that better use should be made of the Association Agreement.
Does he mean that both the human rights provisions in that Agreement and the origin rules in this accord will be examined?
After all, these rules stop privileges from being granted to products that are being exported from the areas of the settlements of Israel in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank.
The peace process is still fragile.
It is being ripped to shreds before it has even started.
I therefore think that more should be done than is currently the case in order to make actual progress.
As far as Iran is concerned, following so many debates this week, I should like to ask for it to be ensured that trade and political interests do not take priority over human rights.
You mentioned the protocol.
I should like to add the human rights aspect, for I do not want women and men from Iran who fight for freedom to be violently oppressed, while we have polite conversations that fall on deaf ears.
Finally, Mr High Representative, a word about Ituri.
It is something but is, I fear, too little.
It is also too late, but I support your efforts nevertheless.
On behalf of the 50 000 people already killed, I should like to ask you to try to do more.
Your current efforts are not enough to protect Ituri as a whole against the violence, and only that can save the peace process in Congo.
I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner and the High Representative for their presence here in this Chamber and for their reports.
To start with, I would like to make a few comments on what I have heard, briefly for I do not have much speaking time.
Firstly, as regards our European policy, I do not believe that the essential, initial priority for those with a political message is the rebuilding of the PNA.
It is important, but it cannot be taken as a basic starting point, or we would be showing bias.
We need to combine it with other points.
The Commissioner cannot establish it as the main priority.
Secondly, I do not believe - and I am addressing Mr BarÃ³n Crespo here - that it should be we who are seeking out the Israelis but, seeing as we are the ones who want to become interlocutors, it has to be we who approach them.
Thirdly, I do not believe - and I am addressing Mrs Morgantini here - that it is for us to define rights, when we can see that the law is being ridden roughshod over by people throwing bombs and killing seven-year old children on the other side.
What I believe we can do as the European Union - and it is important at this time, especially now when Abu Mazen and Ariel Sharon are continuing to talk, although both sides are acting and reacting - is to legitimise the role of Abu Mazen: in this difficult situation, the more legitimacy we give him, the more successful we will be in creating the conditions for relative peace.
Moreover, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the presence of the Iranian delegation to call upon Iran, precisely because of its long history and its role in the Middle East, to recognise the State of Israel: let it do so, if necessary, through the European Union, but let it recognise the State of Israel.
This is important and essential, not least in terms of the recognition of human rights and of economic and, therefore, political development too within Iran.
I am sure that this would help to pave the way for a genuine, lasting peace process in the Middle East.
Mr President, the violent destruction of the State of Israel. That is what the Palestinian Islamic terrorist movement, Hamas, has in mind.
Peace efforts in the Middle East must concentrate on neutralising enemies of peace, such as Hamas.
The Council decisions taken the day before yesterday in Luxembourg constitute a step, albeit a very late step, in the right direction.
The European Union would now like to act against the entire Hamas movement, and no longer confine itself to the so-called military wing of Hamas.
I truly hope that the Member States will be united in adopting a consistent policy against another enemy of peace in the region, the Lebanese Hezbollah, for that 'Party of Allah' does not want to resign itself to the existence of a Jewish state either.
In its meeting in Luxembourg, the Council was right to underline the need for a constructive stance in the fight against terror by the States in the Middle East themselves.
The Islamic Republic of Iran, of all states, with which the European Union is in intense negotiation at present about a deepening of the economic and political relationship, is refusing to cooperate.
Mr President, how else am I to interpret the statement which Iranian ex-President Rafsanjani made last Friday?
With an obvious reference to the suicide bombers, this authoritative Persian politician stated: 'For each Palestinian who goes to Heaven, 300 Israelis go to Hell'.
The European Union must continue to take a forceful and consistent stand against this religious legitimisation and encouragement of terror, for the sake of its own political credibility, both inside and outside the Union and, above all, for the sake of peace in the Middle East.
Mr President, scarcely had the United States taken the important step forward of recognising, through President Bush, the undeniable need for Palestinians to have a viable State and for Americans to play an active role in the Israeli-Palestinian issue, using all of their might to ensure that the Roadmap is implemented, than the unstoppable chain of attacks and ripostes began again, compromising the re-launch of the negotiating process that was outlined in Aqaba.
We must deplore the increasing influence in this respect of the most extreme Palestinian movements, and in particular Hamas. Their contention of the legitimacy of the Israeli State is totally unacceptable.
However, should we not begin to ask ourselves whether the increase in the number of attacks aimed at dividing the Palestinians and the refusal to accept once and for all that they deserve an independent State worthy of its name are perhaps the two main factors that are bolstering Hamas today and at the same time weakening the Palestinian Authority as a whole?
The financial hunt and the targeted assassinations are certainly not the most effective methods of reducing the extremists' success.
The most effective methods are the political methods.
When the Palestinians are offered a credible prospect of a genuine State which, although small, will be a sovereign State and have the necessary territorial continuity for a fully functioning State rather than a pseudo-State or the appearance of a State, that is when the Hamas star will pale once and for all.
There is also one method that we should not ignore or refuse to consider, and that could play an important role in facilitating the separation of the two parties and the resumption of dialogue: the power of interposition.
We are well aware that eventually, at the appropriate time of course, the presence on the ground of an outside force of this kind will prove to be essential.
Indeed, from a European point of view, this means doing more than remaining a spectator or a commentator at this stage; this is where we could make a useful contribution to the search for peace.
I understand, Mr High Representative, that you do not approve of this idea initiated by France, but also taken up by the United Nations Secretary-General and others.
If that is indeed the case, I am very sorry because I believe that it is an original and useful idea, which we should instead try to share with our partners if we truly want to make our contribution in a way other than by declaiming the resumption of the peace process.
Mr President, a few weeks ago we saw the publication of the long-awaited US Roadmap to peace in the Middle East, a document fully supported by the rest of the international community, including the Quartet of the US, the EU, Russia and the UN.
No-one should underestimate the significance of this initiative, at a time when despite the terrible violence on both sides, a rare opportunity for moving forward has now finally presented itself.
There is increasing acceptance amongst Arabs of the desirability of a negotiated solution, whilst Prime Minister Sharon himself has talked of the damage to Israel's economy and society caused by the continuing violence, and the impossibility of permanent occupation and Israeli rule over four million Palestinians.
Only the extremists, it seems, are afraid of peace.
Whatever the origins of the Middle East conflict, there is increasing recognition amongst Arabs that Israel is here to stay, whilst Jews around the world can see that Israel's long-term security is best served via recognition of the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to have their own State by 2005.
President Bush was understandably reluctant earlier in his presidency to become involved in the minutiae of negotiations which led nowhere and he wisely stood back.
He has now taken the right step at the right time to show his personal commitment to a lasting peace.
For the first time in many years a solution seems to be in sight.
That opportunity must not be wasted.
The Roadmap is specific on a number of points, not least an immediate cessation of violence on both sides, an initial freezing of settlements and their eventual dismantling, and a willingness on the part of the Palestinian Authority to face up to its historical responsibilities, and rein in the men of violence.
Israel, for its part, now that it has accepted the Roadmap, must give Prime Minister Abbas the chance to show his commitment to the peace process.
If the Palestinian authorities arrest those who continue to attack Israeli civilians, there will be no need for helicopter gunships to attack Palestinian civilian areas.
Nothing would be worse than for this process to be held up because of reprisal killings by the Israeli Government if the Palestinian authority is genuinely committed to peace now.
Israel's agreement today to end the track-and-kill operations of senior political figures from Islamist groups is to be welcomed.
I also welcome the timely decision taken on Monday by the EU Foreign Ministers to issue an ultimatum to Hamas to implement the Roadmap of face serious financial consequences.
Already their military wing is a classified terrorist organisation and their despicable and tragic policy of recruiting suicide bombers must be repeatedly and universally condemned by all.
Nevertheless, I am pleased that Hamas is now starting new truce talks with Prime Minister Abbas.
I agree with Commissioner Patten that the future Palestinian State must be territorially contiguous and viable and not peppered by Israeli settlements, whilst clearly the right of return needs delicate handling.
Perhaps a generous financial package of compensation to those who lost property might be the final answer.
Imaginative thinking is also needed for the final status of East Jerusalem.
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten personally for his total and transparent collaboration with the working group on scrutiny of EU funds to the Palestinian authority which is now up and running and will reach its conclusion by next year.
It is worth noting that, unlike Iraq, the Quartet is an example of how a common European foreign and security policy based on unanimity can actually work.
Iraq, by contrast, has shown us that a single, majority voting policy, much less one that could be communitarised, is wholly unrealistic and will result in division and animosity by all parties.
In the meantime there is much work for the EU to do to convince both sides of the Arab-Israeli problem that peace is the only real option available in the long term.
Mr President, as rapporteur for the report on the Middle East, I decided some months ago to focus on what is known as the 'Roadmap'.
I felt it would be absurd to do otherwise when the Roadmap is currently the Union's guiding principle and when the Palestinian Authority - although I do not know how many Palestinians - support this document and the process it sets out.
In all honesty, I am not convinced at the moment that Ariel Sharon has any great enthusiasm, either for the process or for the document.
I say this for the following reason: when the Prime Minister presented the Roadmap to his government, he described it as a 'necessary evil' and secured his cabinet's vote by stating that the 14 reservations or amendments presented to Washington - not to the 'Quartet' - are non-negotiable.
The Prime Minister made no mention of having to remove settlements, which is crucial if a viable Palestinian State is to be achieved.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Sharon declared on 27 May in the Knesset that the settlements would not be discussed in the context of the Roadmap, but bilaterally between Jerusalem and Washington.
Israeli television also stated on 10 June that Washington had accepted Israel's request for matters to proceed in this way.
In light of these details, I wish to ask the High Representative whether he believes that this information and specifically this bilateral agreement on settlements between Jerusalem and Washington, if confirmed, might constitute a breach of the Roadmap.
I should also like to ask the High Representative whether, in his opinion, Israel's 14 reservations or amendments, if accepted, could destroy all prospects for the process and for peace itself.
Mr President, in our view, the Roadmap represents, at all events, a chance of peace which must be pursued over and above any feelings of like or dislike.
It calls, first and foremost, for an end to the conflict, to terrorism, to suicide attacks, to targeted assassinations; it calls for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories so that two peoples can coexist in peace within secure borders, with the guarantee of democratic institutions.
To this end, we believe that the role of the international community is essential to the Roadmap, but we also believe that the European Union must forge itself a stronger, more incisive role in Middle East politics, not in order to set itself up against the United States but precisely so as to stop continually burying its head in the sand and to establish a foreign policy.
Basically, that is the challenge facing the Convention, although it is not yet clear how best to tackle it: the challenge of building a political Europe which is able to address at global, at world-wide level the major issues of today - democracy, peace, freedom and development for all peoples, irrespective of race, colour or creed.
Mr President, for Iran the concept of Europe was first formulated, in contradistinction to Asia, in the historic work of Herodotus, when he wrote about the Persians' attack on Europe, which was then the Greek city states.
I think that it is a bit late for revenge and, if you think about it, we had our revenge under Alexander the Great.
I am deeply concerned about the European Union's policy towards Iran.
I am deeply concerned about the combination of these two decisions taken by the Council on Monday which, on the one hand, raise major questions about the application of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in Iran on the basis of its nuclear programme and, on the other hand, announce a general strategy which also ends in the possibility of using violence in the event that the principles governing the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are violated.
I think that we are playing with fire.
I think that we are laying a huge mine under the very efforts by Iranian students with whom, I think, most members sympathise, with the pretexts we are giving the conservative regime to crush their rebellion.
I think that it needs a great deal of care on the part of the Council and on the part of Mr Solana and the Commission.
To finish, I have two questions.
The first is this: just as we are calling on Iran to reply timely, fully and adequately, we want the government of the United States and the British Government to tell us if they found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so that we do not wage wars for nothing.
And the second question is this: Mr High Representative, these three days you will be in Greece, are you prepared to read Aeschylus' tragedy 'The Persians' in Spanish translation?
Mr President, with only one minute to speak I will focus on the Roadmap and how to keep it on the road.
The answer can be boiled down to one sentence: the respect for the rule of international humanitarian law.
Any struggle to make Palestinians respect humanitarian law, including those who engage in the criminal act of suicide bombing, will be futile if the State of Israel - the primary party responsible for respecting this rule - repeatedly violates it.
It is illegal to build settlements on the occupied territories and demolish houses.
It is against humanitarian law to make targeted assassinations accompanied by the killing of innocent civilians, to mention but a few.
I therefore urge the Quartet to make it crystal clear that international humanitarian laws must be respected by all parties.
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how many peace plans has the Middle East already witnessed?
How many were not worth the paper they were written on?
It is futile to answer this question.
It is only now that conditions are in place which, despite everything, do have a prospect of success.
This is undoubtedly due to the European Union's efforts and the Roadmap which it produced together with its Quartet partners, the USA, Russia and the United Nations.
Of course, there have been plans before, including the Mitchell plan.
A Roadmap and a good timetable certainly do not guarantee that we will actually get to where we want to be.
There have to be the right actors on both sides, and of course there also has to be pressure from the United States on Israel.
While the European Union is important because it also has credibility among the Palestinians - too much, sometimes, for the Israelis - I do feel optimistic, after the meeting between Abu Mazen, Mr Sharon and President Bush, that the new peace initiative can be kept separate from the deadly cycle of violence and reprisals.
This is partly to do with the overall political environment in the Middle East.
With the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime - whatever you may think of the US intervention - one obstacle has fallen away; the system has been removed, cutting the ground from under the radical Palestinian movements and those who are in favour of extremism.
Iran too, which has always provided the backing for Hizbollah, should play a constructive role here and think about whether it wants to continue supporting this organisation as it has done until now.
There is currently an opportunity to isolate the radical forces and give the moderates a chance.
This approach can only work if the European Union and the United States complement each other and do not pursue different strategies.
While the situation in Iraq is tragic and unsatisfactory, there is also a possibility, for the first time, that Syria and therefore perhaps Lebanon as well will join a peace process with Israel.
However, that means that Israel must make sacrifices too.
Prime Minister Sharon must not bow to pressure from radical settlers and movements, as this would ensure that Israel could only develop within its biblical borders.
The EU must encourage and back him in this as well.
Most of the Israeli population is willing to make some sacrifices in order to live in peace and security.
However, this also means, of course, that the Palestinian side must abandon its strident demand for refugee return on a one-to-one basis, which would spell the end for the State of Israel.
Should the European Union be involved with its own peacekeeping troops?
This option requires serious thought.
I myself find it difficult to foresee any real benefit, firstly because Israel has never entrusted any military force but its own with its security, and secondly because the force could become the target for suicide attacks without being able to prevent them.
Ultimately, everything stands or falls by President Bush's determination to help the Palestinians live in their own state.
He must show this determination even in an election year.
The only way to prevent the Roadmap from trickling into the desert sands is for the European Union and the USA to work together and adopt a unified approach.
If they appear to be competitors in the Middle East, this will create a window of opportunity for fresh extremism.
Mr President, in a history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the leader writer of the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharonot writes that 'no public document before the negotiations has ever been applied'.
In fact, publication kills implementation.
In accordance with this macabre logic, the Quartet's Roadmap has already been killed on two occasions.
The first time was by the proclamation of the 14 reservations, accepted by Washington, of Sharon's Government.
This deprives the various stages of the Roadmap of any substance.
But the worst thing is that Sharon wishes to remove all references to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which form the legal basis of any peaceful resolution in the Middle East.
If the law is annoying, we should therefore begin by doing away with it.
With the war in Iraq, hegemonic power has set an example.
The second torpedo launched against the implementation of the new peace plan is the shameless return of lex talionis: attacks followed straight away by poorly targeted assassinations.
The downward spiral of violence is turning faster and faster.
There is thus no opportunity to return to the absolute calm required to get the process up and running.
Faced with this regrettable development, the only sensible proposal comes from the United Nations Secretary-General.
He recommends sending a force to operate between the two parties. This proposal was immediately rejected by Sharon's Government as Israel does not have any borders, and as long as Israel does not accept its own borders, there will be absolutely no chance of any peace plan starting or succeeding.
Given this impasse, a simple and clear solution is required, a solution that would instantly put an end to the terrorism: Israel must implement Resolutions 242 and 338, withdraw from the occupied territories and withdraw its troops back to within its internationally recognised borders.
The application of international law is a guarantee of immediate success for the Roadmap.
The UN, the United States and the European Union have the resources to do this, but they lack the political will and the courage.
Mr President, I have three observations to make.
We were horrified by the events of 11 September.
The suicide attacks to which the Palestinian terrorists are subjecting the Israelis are a daily 11 September, and beginning to evacuate the settlements changes nothing at the moment unfortunately.
My second comment relates to the Roadmap.
We must not be mistaken as regards its nature.
It is a framework and is not designed to be a straitjacket.
It opens negotiations and is not designed to close them.
It is a programme and is not designed to be a diktat.
Thirdly, in the negotiations that are now beginning, Europe's position is weak because it is unbalanced and appears to be biased.
Italian diplomacy has begun to work towards restoring the balance.
We must wish it every success in ensuring that the Italian Presidency finally enables Europe to play a useful role in establishing peace.
Mr President, in the last few weeks, we have switched between hope and despair almost on a daily, even hourly basis.
Nonetheless, we - and by that I mean Europe and the USA - must remain faithful to the implementation of the Roadmap.
It is as much an American plan as a European one.
Indeed, we pressed hard - and I thank Mr Solana and Mr Patten for this - for the publication and then for the implementation of this Roadmap.
Now, as some speakers have already said, there is a chance of achieving peace only if we both adopt a joint approach.
I do not take the view that Europe is acting unilaterally if it puts appropriate pressure on both sides - on Israel and the Palestinians.
We need a viable and secure state both for Israel and for Palestine.
That needs to be recognised.
We do not want violence from the other side - and Mr Nordmann, if I recall the debate in committee, what else is the settlement activity, which is illegal under international law, but violence?
The construction of the wall is appalling violence, profoundly affecting people's living conditions and even their lives.
Of course, the same applies to the horrifying acts of terrorism, for which I have no sympathies whatsoever.
We made it clear to the Iranians with whom we spoke yesterday in particular that any form of sympathy with, or indeed, acceptance of terrorism cannot be tolerated by Europe.
Above all, however, terrorism is one thing: it is self-destructive.
Any society based on terrorism already bears the taint of violence within itself.
What we certainly need is support for Palestine's security.
The Palestinian Authority will be unable to resolve the security problem on its own.
What we also need - and even if the Israelis are opposed to this, we must exert constant pressure to achieve it - are international troops as observers, but also with the option of intervening.
We also need Abu Mazen to be successful.
The Commissioner takes the view that we need elections, and I think he is right, but elections can only take place usefully once Abu Mazen has had a chance to prove that his course is better and more successful for the Palestinians than the terrorism perpetrated by Hamas and other movements.
Over the last few days, a young Israeli doctor came to visit me.
She spent two years in the military and now she is providing medical care in a mobile clinic in the Palestinian territories.
Day after day, this young Israeli goes into the Palestinian territories and helps to ensure that the Palestinians have a modicum of basic healthcare.
As long as such people exist in Israel and on the Palestinian side, we must do everything we can to press for peace in the Middle East with hope and confidence.
Mr President, Commissioner, High Representative, it would appear that to the many enemies of peace that we know must be added improvisation and presumption, which, when employed by people in leading institutional positions, can have devastating effects.
I am referring to the recent visit to Israel by the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and to the fact that, in ten day's time, Mr Berlusconi will take on the post of President-in-Office of the Council here in Brussels.
I would point out that, after Ariel Sharon had proudly and artfully received him in the one, indivisible capital of the State of Israel, establishing quite a subversive interpretation of the Roadmap, Mr Berlusconi refused in exchange to meet Yasser Arafat and Abu Mazen.
On this matter, I agree with the French Foreign Minister, Mr De Villepin, when he said that Mr Berlusconi 'had not satisfied the European position', which is one of wisdom, of dialogue with all.
I therefore call upon you, Mr President, to remind Mr Berlusconi, not as Head of the Italian Government but as future President-in-Office of the Council and representative of a European institution, that the duty and objective of the European institutions is not to display or demonstrate friendship to peoples but to pursue a single goal, that of peace.
.
(ES) Mr President, I have listened extremely closely to the speeches by the honourable Members of this Parliament.
I believe that I have taken note of them all and we shall try to draw on them in the same spirit as that adopted by most Members who have spoken here this afternoon.
We all have the same aim - an aim I believe we have shared for a long time and not just as of today - which is to find a formula that will enable us to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions, with the existence of two States that are able to live next to one another in peace and stability, in a region that is stable and in which the two States are recognised by all their neighbours.
This is our earnest desire, our dream and what we want to become a reality as soon as possible.
I wish to reply very briefly to the two questions put to me by Mr MenÃ©ndez del Valle.
In response to the first, I am not aware of any bilateral agreement that addresses the issue of settlements.
I am only aware of the 'Roadmap' as a whole.
Secondly, there can be reservations, on the part of all those involved, provided that all Members of the 'Quartet' are willing to implement the Roadmap in its entirety.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the statements by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission on the security strategy for the European Union, including implementation of the United Nations programme to combat the illegal trade in light weapons.
.
(ES) Mr President, I wish to inform you all, as succinctly and briefly as I can, about the work that is being undertaken on what could be called 'European security'.
As you will recall, ladies and gentlemen, at the Rhodes meeting I was given the mandate to try to present, in time for the Thessaloniki European Council, a document on issues related to European security, although this will probably not be the last document on the matter.
I must emphasise that what is significant is that for the first time the European Union wishes to have a document of this type; there is a desire not only for Member States to have their own documents, but also for the European Union, collectively, to have a document on its security strategy.
I believe that this is a first, and I want to underline that this is a major step forwards in building a Europe which moves ahead by political means.
First of all, I base my approach on a fundamental principle, which underpins the entire content of the document.
A Europe of these dimensions, with 25 democratic countries, which will soon have a population twice as large as that of the United States of America and four times that of Japan (and I take as examples the large countries that, like ours, have a strong currency), a Europe which accounts for approximately one quarter of gross world product must not fail, I repeat, to be an international player.
Whether we want to or not, we will have to be an international player.
This principle, in which I firmly believe - and in which I hope you also believe, ladies and gentlemen - must underpin our entire approach to managing the process of achieving security in Europe.
The document is about to be completed and will be presented to the Heads of Government next Thursday and Friday in Thessaloniki.
I now wish to summarise its structure for you.
It opens with an analysis of the security environment in which we live, which obviously includes regional conflicts and the causes of these conflicts that affect us: poverty, exclusion, or a lack of natural resources.
The report then goes on to look at more recent threats such as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and failed states.
On the basis of this analysis, it moves on to a second chapter which addresses what must, in our opinion, be the main strategic objectives for Europe's security.
Logically, the first strategic objective must be to extend and stabilise the security zone around the European Union, in other words, around our continent, specifically to the east and the south.
I believe that the document that the Commission presented recently on the new Europe and Europe's borders is largely concerned with where and how the European Union should start developing its security environment.
The second important point about strategic security objectives must, in our opinion, be to strengthen the international order.
We could probably describe Europe's place in the international order in this way: we are effective multilateralists and it is on effective multilateralism that we must base our theory of the world order.
For this reason, we are working and wish to continue working to protect Europe's security through all organisations and specifically through the United Nations.
Of course, there are players that have more individual roles to play, such as the United States, the Russian Federation and other large countries or major international players.
What I would like to say, however, and we have attempted to make the document reflect this deeply-considered idea, is that in order to ensure an effective multilateral system and more specifically the credibility of the United Nations system, we must in theory be prepared to ensure that all the principles on which the United Nations is founded are observed and that this organisation has the credibility that it deserves.
When some of the principles underpinning the Charter and some Security Council resolutions are not observed, the European Union cannot remain passive and must act; and it must act with all the considerable means available to it.
Fortunately, the European Union has a whole panoply of means for acting that range from diplomatic activity to armed peacekeeping action.
Mr Hughes, who is not present at the moment, made a useful incidental observation on how the European Union can also play a major role in effective dialogue in the event of conflict.
We must have the courage, however, to say to ourselves that when rules, the principles that we have all decided to defend in the context of this effective multilateralism are flouted, the European Union must also be willing to face up to this breach of international agreements or contracts, be they political or of any other type.
Lastly, the third point that must be made is how to deal with the new threats, which are terrorism, the proliferation of weapons and failed states ...
On these issues which are new or which involve new aspects, although some of them have been around for many years, we have to say that they are risks and threats of a different kind to those that we have experienced before.
The first difference is that they can be perpetrated from a distance.
Throughout the cold-war era, we were used to having threats at our borders.
Today we are facing perhaps the first threat situated far from our border and we consequently need to deploy our capacities beyond our borders.
I therefore believe that when we were given the mandate in Helsinki, at the end of 1999, to start considering how the European Union could undertake civilian and military action, this possibility was also being considered.
These new threats are also dynamic, and we must therefore prevent them and try, as soon as possible, to ensure that they are not allowed to become a reality, whether they are caused by hunger, climate change or other types of conflict, such as ethnic or religious struggles.
I believe that swift prevention is an obligation incumbent upon us and must form one strand of the philosophy underlying the European Union's action.
These new threats are more complex, more complicated than anything we have experienced before and consequently our response to them cannot be a simple one.
We cannot respond to something that is complex with simplicity; our response must also be complex and it would, in my opinion, be a mistake to think that there can be a military solution to these problems.
I do not believe that there can be and what we therefore have to do is make use of all the means, the entire panoply of means available to the European Union as a whole. These range, as I have said, from diplomacy, humanitarian aid, crisis management, trade, sanctions etc. to managing crises with military means.
I believe, however, that it would be an extremely serious mistake to think that the only solution to this type is a military one. I also believe it would be wrong to think that the focus of the war against these new threats should be strictly military.
To conclude, I should like the document to end with a call for a Europe with clearly-defined characteristics, a Europe that must be more active on the world stage and which must therefore have the political will to act.
I hope that the debate that has taken place in recent months in the Convention leads to the conclusion, not only by Parliament but also by the citizens of our continent, that if we genuinely want to assume our rightful position in the world, with the wealth and the well-being that we enjoy, we also have obligations associated with these benefits and these obligations must be met.
There must, therefore, be greater activity, a greater political will to act and this, I believe, is crucial.
If we wish to act, therefore, we must have the capacity to act; and hence we must also make the necessary effort, which involves developing military and civilian capacities; and I cannot conceal the fact that having greater capacities to act and to exert influence in the world also requires more resources.
This Parliament and national parliaments, national governments, will have to face up to this reality; otherwise our words will be somewhat hypocritical.
We cannot cry when we see the suffering of others on television and yet not be willing to do what needs to be done.
In order to do what needs to be done, we must have the resources and these resources are going to have to come from the citizens of our continent, of our own European Union, who will also have to be generous enough to pay for the resources necessary to undertake the action that we are being asked every day to carry out.
In my first speech, I spoke about the operation in the Congo.
This is an example of what we might have to do in future and it will surely be on a larger scale.
We are able to undertake such action at the moment because of the means we can pool together, but also because of the means available to some nations in particular that can take on this role; others cannot.
We must all, therefore, make an effort to maintain a level of capacities that will enable us to play the role we say we want to play.
I repeat, the Europe we want is a Europe that has greater visibility, a will to act, and the means with which to put this will into practice; it is a Europe that also has the necessary coherence to act, and by this I mean that there must be coherence, within the European Union and in all of its institutions and between the European Union and its Member States so that the entire effort, for example the diplomatic effort, can bear fruit.
Consider for a moment that the European Union's diplomatic network, with all of its Member States, would be considerably greater than that of the country with the largest diplomatic network.
If we put it to the service of a cause, we would probably be a thousand times more effective than we are at the moment.
I believe that the document that we shall be presenting to the Heads of State and Government on Thursday and Friday in Thessaloniki follows this approach, which I believe is in line with the ideas of most Members of this Parliament.
.
Mr President, over the last three or four years the High Representative and I have made speeches on this subject which I guess you could measure by the metre, and if you were to look at them, you would find that they were all remarkably similar and reflected the arguments which the High Representative has put again so forcefully and ably today.
In many respects it is remarkable that the European Union has proceeded so far and so fast towards a Common Foreign and Security Policy, and towards a Security and Defence Policy without the benefit - until now - of a formal Security Strategy.
The Commission very much welcomes the decision to rectify that omission and looks forward to the debates that will take place on the strategy document which is going to come forward shortly.
On the defence and military side there has been impressive progress in creating European capacities that the Union is already beginning to put to use.
As the High Representative has said, we need to be explicit about our strategic purposes, and the circumstances in which the European Union might deploy force.
As I have said before and as he has said, we also have to challenge our colleagues in government and our electorates about the gap which exists between ambition and what people are prepared to pay, and what people are prepared to cooperate over.
The Commission, as I have said before, is not a silent and disinterested onlooker in this debate.
We have no direct role in defence and military matters, and even in the absence of my honourable friend Mr Van Orden, I repeat that we do not aspire to a direct role in defence and military matters.
But whatever the EU does militarily - whether in conflict prevention, crisis management or post-conflict reconstruction - is inevitably part of a wider European strategy including many elements for which the Commission does indeed have the lead responsibility.
The European Union needs a seamless approach, which is why the High Representative and I - with our respective services - have worked so closely together, and why I am pleased that the European Convention has proposed even closer integration in future.
The real point I want to make, however, is that defence and military issues are only one dimension - and for the European Union still a relatively small dimension - of any 'Security Strategy' which is worthy of the name.
In a sense, the EU itself - its creation, its development and its enlargement - can be seen as a European Security Strategy, and it has been a brilliantly effective one.
The Union has provided the central economic and political organising principle for our continent over the last half century, helping to secure democracy and stability for countries emerging from dictatorship and oppression.
Through the Wider Europe agenda, too, we seek to extend stability to our neighbours and the circle of friends around us.
Perhaps the central element in any security strategy for Europe must be to ensure that the EU itself continues to prosper and to develop.
Beyond that, the EU is a major contributor to international security in a host of different contexts: through, for example, our contribution to global trade.
The EU has played a central role in the creation and development of the World Trade Organisation, and we are now engaged in the Doha Development Round.
It would be hard to exaggerate the importance of that work for global security, because security and prosperity are so closely intertwined.
We also contribute to global security through external development assistance.
I have pointed out to the House before that we are responsible - the EU, the Commission and Member States - for about 55% of all such assistance worldwide, and for about two-thirds of all grant assistance.
That is a vital contribution to security because poverty and inequality are not just moral issues but also security issues.
Through our assistance, too, we work for human rights and for better governance.
Again, these are security issues linked, for example, to the fight against terrorism, because inequality and oppression are the breeding ground of hatred, intolerance and violence.
Above all, however, the EU can contribute to international security through its work in - and support for - multinational frameworks and disciplines that are increasingly necessary and important for managing the affairs of an interdependent world.
I am thinking here of UN disarmament and non-proliferation Conventions; environmental Treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change; and, of course, the International Criminal Court.
I could go on - but the point is clear.
We cannot simply divide between our security interests on the one hand and our development and trade interests on the other.
In order to prevent future violent conflicts we have to have policies on environmental degradation, poverty and global governance, AIDS, Justice and Home Affairs, nuclear safety, and so on. I think the point is clear.
So the underlying conclusion is that effective multilateralism should be the motto on the European Union's banner.
That is the essence of our security strategy.
I shall say a brief word about small arms and light weapons, because that too underlines the importance of practical and effective multilateralism.
We are committed to combating the spread of small arms around the world.
A code of conduct on arms exports was adopted five years ago, under which Member States set high common standards for the management of conventional arms transfers.
The code has since established itself as a comprehensive international arms export regime.
In a joint action covering small arms later in 1998 the EU pledged to promote a number of principles including commitments by all countries to supply small arms only to governments, and to import and hold arms exclusively for their legitimate security needs.
The EU has set aside funds for the provision of financial and technical assistance to small arms programmes and projects around the world.
I look forward to the publication of the document on security.
As the High Representative said, this will be the beginning of a very important debate, and of course much of that debate will take place in these hallowed chambers.
We look forward to hearing the contributions of honourable Members who have already made a significant contribution to the broader comprehension of security which is now shared throughout the EU.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, it is my belief that events in the current and previous year have made apparent our real need for clear thinking on this issue.
Commissioner Patten has described the many areas in which the European Union is actively involved, and it might well make sense for us to view them as parts of a coherent whole in order to make clear how much these - in many areas, thoroughly presentable - instruments benefit each other.
This is where issues connected to overseas and development aid will of course be of correspondingly great importance.
What this means is that potential tensions need to be reduced where the prevention of poverty is concerned, and both those actively involved and the European public need to become more aware of the fact that these are also instruments whereby we conduct foreign policy, and that they are in the interests of our Member States.
In the context of this discussion about prevention, an area in which so much is being done, Mr Solana is indeed right to say, as he has done in this debate, that we have to find the right combination of prevention, military capacity, and the measures needed for reconstruction in the aftermath of action.
I believe that there is something missing here, either in terms of awareness or of practice.
If - as we are right to do - we do indeed perform these preventive tasks, we see that they, in themselves, do not give the European Union any greater influence, as the military option has to be available to us if we are to be able to make it clear that we could also take other kinds of action.
This was our experience in the Balkans in the early 1990s, when the European negotiators brought about some thirty-four ceasefire agreements - I am not sure precisely how many - and the reason why none of them came to anything was that Milosevic knew perfectly well that we lacked the military capacity to ensure that these ceasefire agreements were kept to.
Bit by bit, right up to the Cologne Summit, and, beyond that, in Saint-Malo and on many other occasions, we learned the necessary lessons from this, which have now enabled us to progress further.
Here, too, though, we see that this must first be incorporated into a real strategy, that it is not yet fully operational, and that we do not yet know how it is to work, as, of course, we have to evaluate certain of its constituent parts in relation to this.
What priority do we in fact give to combating terrorism, and to what extent do the instruments enable us to do that?
The argument adduced by the Americans in relation to the war in Iraq was also to some degree an argument about terrorism.
Are we ourselves clear in our own minds about the extent to which traditional military means can be deployed to combat terrorism?
The same applies to the area of non-proliferation.
If we could do as - for example - the Israelis did in Iraq in the early 1980s, and destroy a nuclear power plant with a single pre-emptive strike, thereby preventing the development of any nuclear capability, could this be part of such a strategy, one that might enable us, with less or scarcely any loss of human life, to develop capacities to prevent immense dangers and subsequent wars?
I believe that we have to answer these questions.
On this occasion, I am framing them as questions, but they ought to form part of a specific and consistent approach if we are to be able to put something on the table in the way that the Bush administration has done, where we can identify both similarities and differences and will very definitely be enabled to conduct on a stable basis the dialogue with the United States that is necessary if we are to start working together or perhaps achieve a rapprochement, and that will help enable the Americans to abandon unilateralism.
I agree that the European Union is itself a security policy measure; that is one of the primary reasons for its existence.
The wider Europe that this is intended, astutely enough, to organise on a multilateral rather than merely bilateral basis, which is meant to be the European Economic Area with something added; our relations with Russia and the developing world and also with the Mediterranean countries - all these things are vitally important, but, in this context, we must indeed give some thought to the future of our relations with the United States, and it is my belief that, in the long term, NATO will not, on its own, be a sustainable bond between us.
As regards NATO and transatlantic relations, there are two conditions, which we too must fulfil: only if we are strong will we be partners to be taken seriously, and there is no partnership when, rather than both sharing in decisions, one partner takes the decisions and the other merely follows behind.
We have to play our part in creating the right conditions.
The second point in relation to all this is that we have to put our relations on a broader basis, one that has to do with more than security policy and the military, and that is why we need again to seize the initiative and have the sort of discussions that we had at the beginning of the 1990s, which I might perhaps sum up under the heading of 'transatlantic market place' in order, on this basis, to put something in place in many of the areas in which the European Union is competent.
We, and the USA, have treaties with every country on earth, but we have no treaty with each other.
If such a strategy is to be complete, I believe that we should give some thought to this.
Mr President, Mr High Representative, Commissioner, the development of a European security strategy is a major step forward.
After all, by establishing the principles and objectives of the policy, it becomes more coherent and provides a framework for what has been achieved over the past few years.
It does not guarantee that the European Union will also speak with one voice, but it does make it more logical and easier to do so.
The confusion surrounding Iraq, but also the new US security strategy, lie behind today's debate.
The need for such a debate, however, is born out of the European Union's increased ambition to play a greater security role. Fortunately, this ambition remains unabated even after this year's events.
The details of the document to be presented in Thessaloniki are as yet unknown, but we assume, as Mr Solana has already indicated, that the strategy is based on a broad interpretation of security.
A lack of security has many causes and requires a large number of varied instruments to combat it.
New threats, such as international terrorism, require more attention.
We also back the implementation of an EU action plan against the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
Countries that violate agreements or form a great risk must be tackled, Iran being a case in point.
The threat of violence should not, however, be the first line of attack, but the EU should also consider how the Treaty could be further reinforced to combat the spread of nuclear weapons.
Over the past few months, much has been said about the European Union's deficient military capacity.
We are said to offer too little counterweight to US supremacy.
In my view, this is the wrong approach.
It is not about having to outdo the Americans militarily, but about being able to act just as effectively in a different way and with a different combination of resources whenever we deem this necessary.
This should not be done unilaterally - that is not our style - but within multilateral frameworks and, in particular, with the involvement of the UN.
We have never ruled out the use of military force, but it should be seen as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted.
It should be deployed effectively and proportionately.
This is why, even after the event, we remain doubtful as to the justification of the war against Iraq.
We hope that the EU strategy will be clear about the role of the military instrument.
In the light of this philosophy, we nevertheless have to conclude that the development of the military dimension of the Common Foreign and Security Policy is trailing behind our ambitions.
We therefore support the intentions to ratchet up the speed and develop more activities in this area, and we are prepared to hold an open discussion about the financial implications.
Mr Solana made a passionate plea for an open debate of this kind a moment ago.
At the same time, we are confident about another priority, namely conflict management and crisis management, being fully integrated in the new strategy.
This is still the current CFSP's strongest asset.
Closer to home, also in Europe, we operate more effectively than outside it.
We assume that the High Representative is taking these experiences into consideration, and we are also looking forward to seeing how the strategy will work out for the different regions where the European Union wants to be active.
When he and the Council work towards an approach characterised by what I indicated above, he can count on my group's unqualified support.
A new and valuable discussion has commenced, and we want to take an active part in it.
Mr President, as the High Representative said, a European Union of 25 countries, 450 million people and a quarter of the world's total national product must assume greater responsibility for its own security and defence; and, I would add, be less dependent upon our friends in the United States.
That is in the interests of both the EU and the United States.
That is something we owe to ourselves, as well as to the Americans who, for many years, have been the guarantors of peace in Western Europe.
We therefore need closer institutional ties between NATO and the EU so that we might react more consistently to the new global challenges in terms of combating international terrorism, organised crime and the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
The objective is therefore the continued development of the EU's defence dimension - which is also supported by the United States - as the European pillar within NATO.
The EU must increasingly work in partnership with the Americans, and not in opposition to them.
The transatlantic alliance can only be maintained in the long term if a proper European defence identity is introduced.
The news we received from the foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg concerning a stronger and more pro-active foreign and defence policy was therefore encouraging, and it is with great excitement that we now await the High Representative's proposal for the first common European security strategy.
We can be happy about the fact that the Council generally wishes to strengthen European defence and cooperation around research and development in this area, but the proposal should also fully support the re-establishment of the transatlantic partnership.
In this connection, it has been gratifying to read what has been termed the Allbright declaration on this partnership.
The declaration also states that the partnership is the supporting pillar of NATO cooperation.
Mr President, it is strange to hear all the talk about European defence when we do not even have a common European foreign policy.
I think that that is the task to which we first have to put our minds, and I should like to see us beginning to talk about what our priorities are to be.
I think the main priority should be for the EU to be the mainstay of an international legal order and of international agreements and for it to be among those backing international weapons control.
Some of those priorities have been given all too little weight for many years, and it is an obvious task for a specifically cooperative organisation like the EU, which is based upon agreements between old enemies.
We must continue that tradition, extend it to the international level and ensure that we become the mainstay of the UN so that international law again comes to prevail.
I should like to hear what the Council's and the Commission's plans are in anticipation of the UN meeting in July on the control of light weapons, for this is one of those areas in which the EU could have a role to play.
We are of course one of the main producers of these weapons, and we also try to control them.
We have a code of conduct from 1998 - mentioned, I believe, by Commissioner Patten - but, of course, weapons prove, all the same, to end up in the wrong hands and on the wrong markets.
We need to follow this agreement up, with the possibility of monitoring weapons throughout their life cycle.
We can do this with dairy cows in the EU.
Would it not be marvellous if we could do the same with weapons?
What plans exist for doing so?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that when we are talking about security a double language is being used.
There are those who say that our real security lies in mediation, cooperation and prevention.
Then there are others who say that our security depends on our defence and intervention capacities and associate it more with military aspects.
As far as I am concerned, the basis of our security is the credibility of our politics.
Are we credible when in our association agreements with the Maghreb countries, for example, or other countries, we insert an Article 2 that talks about human rights and democracy and then quickly forget this article in our actual relations with these countries?
No, no one takes us seriously!
We sign association agreements and whenever things get complicated we forget one of the aspects of our security: being surrounded by democracies.
The more democracies there are, the less the risk of war.
Are we credible?
Elmar Brok is right when he asks if we were credible in the Balkans.
No.
We proclaimed: peace, peace, peace.
Men were massacred and we had no power to intervene.
We therefore were not credible.
When we are told that our positions must be consistent with those of the Americans, that we must not go against the Americans, I say that we should be neither for or against the Americans.
Yet is it credible to say that we are going to war because there are weapons of mass destruction when in fact there are none and it is a lie?
We are not credible.
Do Europeans have the right to say that a lie is a lie?
Are all pro-Americans still annoyed when we say that the Americans lied, that Colin Powell lied in the Security Council?
Let us take another example.
Are we credible when we invoke international law as an argument?
Yet is international law, as it exists today, the Bible?
No.
Is a Security Council without Brazil, without India, without South Africa a Security Council for today's world?
No.
Therefore, fighting for international law is to fight to reform it, to change it.
We must stop saying the same thing over and over: international law as it currently stands came from the Cold War and the Cold War is no longer our problem.
I will end with a comment on terrorism.
Once again, are we credible in this respect when on the one hand, along with others, we quite rightly say that we had to intervene in Afghanistan to combat the terrorism, yet on the other hand we remain silent on everything that has happened in Guantanamo?
Fighting and struggling against terrorism is to fight and struggle for the rule of law, wherever it may be, during war and in the different forms of war.
If we do not succeed in resolving these problems together, we are not credible.
Therefore, as far as I am concerned, the basis of security is credibility.
Mr President, the debate on a joint European security strategy, which was proposed at Rhodes, and whose end-result is to be a strategy on the agenda at Thessaloniki, is very ambitious, but I detect a certain scepticism in Mr Solana's remarks, as well as in yours, Mr Patten.
It will not be the first strategy, or first draft of a strategy, to be presented, and it will certainly not be the last.
Unlike Mr Cohn-Bendit, I take the view that the weak point of this strategy is in fact the point in time at which it is being presented.
The impression is given that it is a counter-strategy in response to the USA.
The European Union and its security strategy would, I think, have been important enough, without being made to be that sort of initiative.
What is true is that the scenario in which we are now living is a new one, characterised by insecurity brought on by regional crisis situations making themselves manifest in international terrorist networks and acts of terrorism, to which they are also exposed.
It is also true, though, that the USA and the EU take a different view of this threat, and respond to it in different ways.
The USA sees itself as being at war with international terrorism and claim that this entitles them to launch pre-emptive strikes.
That is what they did in Afghanistan and in Iraq, putting their trust in their military strength, which nothing in the European Union can match.
The European presence and the definition of its tasks are quite different under such circumstances.
Up to now, Europeans have been neither able nor willing to open up military fronts in dealing with international threats.
I therefore regard their involvement in crisis situations - whether in Afghanistan, from which I returned only yesterday, or in the Congo, as is now being planned - as something to be honoured, but too symbolic and too inconsistent.
Simply showing the flag is far from enough.
Important though they may be, presences of this sort therefore expose themselves to security risks that are hard to calculate and often call forth expectations that we cannot fulfil.
For as long as the Member States of the European Union are not prepared to top up their defence budgets too and make the necessary funds and manpower available, all these doctrines and strategies will seem like empty forms of words.
In view of the opposing views within the EU, the attempt at a common strategy seems more like an attempt at concealing differences of opinion rather than removing them, and that is something of which we should beware.
The devising of strategies and the creation of joint roles such as that of a European Foreign Minister - which I essentially welcome - do nothing to make up for the lack of the political will to give life to a common European policy and security strategy.
The problem of a dualism between the USA and the European Union, and of their mutual alienation, can only adversely affect the quest for a common European security strategy.
Mr President, the presence here of the European Union's two representatives for foreign policy, for whom I have a great deal of respect, is the result of the current operating requirements of the Union, not a peculiar sort of Dioscuri syndrome.
This confirms that the choice to create an EU 'minister for foreign affairs' is the right choice, but I hope that he will not function later on like Janus who, according to mythology, changed his face to suit the circumstances.
During the last decade, we have increasingly noticed the difference between the European Union and the USA on important issues. The International Court for crimes against humanity, the Middle East crisis, the crisis in Iraq, the general perception about preventive war and so on.
In practice, this gives rise to the need for the European Union to define its own independent strategy so that, on the basis of this independence, it can redefine its relations with America and correct its mistakes. This redefinition is a sine qua non, because the axis of the Union's strategy must again rest on its relations with the USA.
Good accounts make good friends.
What, however, should this strategy rest on?
On certain positions in principle and an equal footing.
And an equal footing, in this particular case, means parity.
What does parity mean?
That you have your own opinion, but you also have your own capabilities so that, if necessary, you can formulate your opinion as a policy, negotiate it and obtain results.
We are in a new era.
So-called one-sided threats are completing older procedures and crisis conditions and thus the European Union is obliged de facto to play a new international role.
And personality on strategy issues is precisely what the new international role calls for.
This personality cannot result from minor moves.
It must be the result of an international analysis, an international definition of its personality and its principles.
I believe that we shall do well and that Mr Solana's proposals will be the first step towards the Union's subsequently acquiring independence in its relations with all the powers of the world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics are sufficiently known.
Some half a billion small arms and light weapons are in circulation worldwide, more than half of which are illegal.
In 46 of the 49 major conflicts since 1990, weapons of this kind were used.
These weapons are also largely responsible for the phenomenon of child soldiers.
Small arms and light weapons are easy to come by, in some places for USD 15; they are easy to operate, easy to conceal and transport and, above all, are ever so deadly.
According to an independent study in 2001, small arms claim the lives of more than 1 000 people, mainly innocent people, every day.
Internationally, there are hardly any rules in the area of the production and spread of small arms and light weapons.
The Ottawa Treaty on the use of anti-personnel mines forms an exception to this.
Unfortunately, we have to establish that the largest producers of small arms and light weapons, namely the US, Russia and China, are also the most fervent opponents to international legislation in the style of Ottawa.
In order to get a real grip on the proliferation of small arms, transparency is what is first and foremost required.
The UN register for conventional weapons should be opened to this category of weapons.
The rules on arms exports must be stepped up.
The application of identifying marks during the production of new weapons must become compulsory, so that their origins can be traced more easily.
I share Commissioner Patten's view that the 1998 European code of conduct should serve as a model for a worldwide, binding agreement on arms exports and transfers.
During the UN Conference next July, the European Union should take the lead in the fight against the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons.
Indeed, there is a risk that all efforts in the field of conflict prevention will be in vain if the root causes are not tackled.
Mr President, we need to look at where the light weapons are actually coming from.
In recent events in the Congo, approximately 50 000 people have been victims of the use of light weapons.
We are also sending soldiers to stop the fighting there despite the fact that most of the fighting is taking place with weapons supplied by countries within the European Union.
People in the Congo have not actually made these weapons: they have come from countries in the EU - including France, Belgium, the UK, etc. and elsewhere.
There seems to be a complete contradiction: we are sending people to stop the fighting in places where the weapons used originate in the countries of origin of the so-called 'fighting preventers'.
In relation to the UN review on the programme of action coming up in July 2003, we also need to look at things that remain to be done.
We must close loopholes on the end-use of weapons; on where they actually go and how are they used.
There is a serious loophole in relation to where weapons go, who uses them and what the end consequence is.
We also need to tackle very seriously the brokers of arms.
There are people making huge amounts of money by dealing in arms, by ensuring that countries and people can actually get arms from the arms suppliers.
As Mrs Frahm mentioned in relation to registration, it is absolutely incredible that you can actually trace a piece of meat or an agricultural product, yet you cannot trace a lethal weapon.
It is about time the EU owned up to its responsibility and made it impossible for light arms to be traded like this, causing the death and destruction of many innocent people.
Mr President, the threat that emanates from the large, uncontrolled flows of small arms and the risk of the proliferation of criminal organisations and terrorist groupings has gained relevance since 11 September.
Globally, more than half a billion small arms are in circulation.
The use of these arms is responsible for the death of about 500 000 people every year. Small arms claim 300 000 victims in wars and roughly another 200 000 in non-war situations.
In Bowling for Columbine, the documentary maker, Michael Moore, showed recently the consequences small arms have, even in a country such as the United States: homicides at secondary schools, among youth gangs and in the criminal world.
Invariably, the weapons have been obtained illegally.
Many people are, however, the victims of small arms and light weapons, including in conflicts such as the present one in Congo.
In order to combat the illegal trade in small arms, adequate legislation is required, as well as regulations with regard to the trade in - and production, transit and possession of - small arms, and the distributive trade in weapons must also be monitored.
Weapons must be easy to trace and therefore be provided with a clear mark.
Moreover, records must be kept and it must be possible to exchange this information.
To prevent small arms from entering the illegal circuit, adequate stock management, safe transport and storage, and the destruction of surplus weapons are necessary.
In the light of the UN Conference in New York in three weeks' time, it is important for the EU to play a pioneering role once again.
It can do this by calling for proper monitoring procedures for these weapons, by stepping up existing legislation on monitoring the distributive trade, by insisting on effective traceability and clear marking of weapons, and by pressing home all these requests by being the first in Europe to tackle this legislation.
I often talk about the importance of Europe speaking with one voice.
This step towards unity has been made by the fact that six groups in the European Parliament are united in making this plea.
The Council and the Member States are still to follow suit.
I hope that they will follow this example.
Mr President, I wish to speak, like my fellow Members who have just spoken, about trafficking and the fight against the illegal trade in light weapons.
As in 2001, when the United Nations Conference on the illegal trade in light weapons was held and we welcomed the action plan, we now welcome the assessment meeting that will take place next month.
Precisely with regard to this assessment meeting, we wish to recall, as has already been said, that 500 million small arms and light weapons are at large in the world and cause thousands of deaths every day, according to the 2001 Independent Weapons Study.
Furthermore, most of the victims are women and children.
The illegal trade in small arms and light weapons to developing countries, which are often embroiled in conflicts, originates mainly in Member States of the European Union, in addition -as has also already been pointed out - to the United States and Russia.
The Conference and the action plan now under review have not managed to establish a binding international legal instrument that prohibits illegal trading.
The European Union must focus its efforts on producing a code of conduct that prevents weapons reaching these warring countries, regimes that systematically breach human rights and armed groups that, as has already been said, recruit child soldiers.
We should, therefore, translate these aims into joint action, first by the Member States, whose national laws on the matter are - unfortunately - totally disparate, and then apply these to the international community as a whole.
The assessment meeting presents a good opportunity to achieve this.
Light weapons must fall under the control of an international system, as has been done with anti-personnel mines and chemical and biological weapons.
The European Union should, therefore, take the following proposals to New York: firstly, to establish an international registry of weapons sales; secondly, a specific ban on the sales of light weapons to regimes that breach human rights and thirdly, to establish a system for tracing weapons.
Together with these requests to the Council and to the Member State governments, requests that we put forward in the resolution we would like to see adopted, we also wish to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to step up its cooperation in demobilising armed groups in developing countries.
At present this applies most particularly to Africa.
The current conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Liberia amongst others demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the policy we have implemented to date and the need to monitor weapons sales.
.
(ES) Mr President, out of courtesy to the Members of the European Parliament who have kindly remained with us until the end, I wish to say that the European Union will be embarking on a new exercise, that it will attempt to undertake this exercise as seriously as possible and that it is going to present a document on security strategy, the first ever, in a few days in Thessaloniki, which will certainly be followed by a mandate from the Heads of State and Government to continue working on it.
I also believe - as many speakers have said - that it is good news that the European Union can now start thinking seriously and jointly about a common security strategy.
In order for this to happen, however - and I repeat what several speakers have said - it is absolutely crucial not only to have in place good documents and good structures; there must also be the political will to act in worldwide organisations in a way that reflects the European Union's significance in terms of population, wealth, etc. if the political will to do so exists, it can be done.
Otherwise, however magnificent the papers we produce on the subject might be, they will again be simply papers and nothing else.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to hold this debate and I am sure that the next time, the attendance in the House will be somewhat greater.
The next item is a statement by the Commission on the future of the textile agreement in WTO negotiations.
Madam President, as we all know, the textiles and clothing sector occupies a prominent place in international trade, with flows of EUR 350 000 million in 2002. That is more than 5% of all world exports.
It is a key sector for the developing countries.
It accounts for 50% of world textiles exports and 70% of world clothing exports.
For many of them it is the main source of exports and of industrial employment.
For us Europeans, too, investment, the move upmarket and the world leadership we have acquired in a sector like fashion have also made it a key sector for the future.
Europe is now the world's biggest exporter in textiles and the second largest in clothing.
In today's Europe, 2 million people are employed in textiles and clothing, and in the enlarged Europe that will be 2.5 million and a turnover of EUR 200 000 million.
Knowing how sensitive textiles and clothing are in a large number of countries, the European Commission organised an international conference on 5 and 6 May last, which was attended by delegates from over 80 countries.
We discussed the challenges facing the sector in the years ahead, especially with the final abolition of quotas on 1 January 2005, which is also the proposed date for the conclusion of the current World Trade Organisation negotiations.
Four major findings emerged from that conference.
Firstly, the developing countries are very vulnerable, especially those that are the most dependent on textiles and clothing exports.
This is especially true of the least advanced countries and those with weak or not very diversified economies.
It is also the case of the countries which have preferential agreements with us, like the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean, some of the ACP countries and other small exporters.
Most of these countries depend very much on the textiles and clothing sector for their export revenue, since it may account for virtually all their exports and much of their employment.
Secondly, market access conditions in textiles and clothing differ greatly from one part of the world to another.
While Europe imposes customs duties averaging 9%, for example, many countries have duties as high as 30% or even higher, as well as retaining major non-tariff barriers.
If we therefore confine liberalisation to abolishing quotas in 2005, we are likely to be faced with an unbalanced world market where competition is, as it were, focussed on the markets of the industrialised countries, our markets, where growth is weak.
Thirdly, the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean area.
That is the natural area of competition for the European industry.
I will come back to this.
We have projects concerning it.
Fourthly, increasing competition is likely to intensify pressure on natural and human resources and presents serious problems in terms of sustainable development, but also of conditions of fair competition where fundamental social rights are involved, for example.
Having identified these issues, what are the answers, answers that must of course be found not by us, or by the Americans, or by the Indians or by the Chinese, but found through talks with all the parties concerned in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation?
The first answer is development.
If we are to alleviate the effects on the poorer and weaker countries of abolishing quotas, we must think how to concentrate the preferential access we grant to the developing countries, through the generalised system of preferences, for example, on what will probably be the most vulnerable countries.
I am thinking of the least developed countries.
I am thinking of the ACP group of countries.
I am thinking of the small economies.
We will also have to look at ways of making it easier for the countries concerned to make use of those preferences - I am thinking of the rules of origin, for example - while ensuring, of course, that those countries are indeed the ones which really benefit from the preferences we give.
Secondly, we must use the Doha round to obtain market access conditions that are fair and similar all over the world.
We cannot be satisfied with confining the opening of markets to the abolition of quotas in 2005.
As I said, that would create imbalances in terms of access; but our present proposal in multilateral talks is based on arguments of fairness.
We are calling on all the other members of the WTO to move their customs duties towards a common level, the lowest possible, and obviously to abolish non-tariff barriers.
All countries, except, to our mind, the least developed countries, must contribute to this, including of course those whose textiles and clothing exports are highly competitive.
I would like to use this debate to reassure both the European industry and the countries which enjoy preferential access to the Union's markets.
It is not our intention to further reduce our already quite low customs duties without getting wider access to external markets in return.
We also think changes should be made gradually, with transitional periods for the application of common customs duties to allow those who have problems to make the necessary adjustments.
Thirdly, the Euro-Mediterranean area.
It is in the process of becoming integrated and it should soon enjoy the expected benefits of the pan?Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin rules that should come into effect in the very near future.
This new protocol on rules of origin should be presented to the trade ministers at the Euromed conference in Palermo on 7 July next.
This system of diagonal cumulation of origin will allow economic operators in the Euromed area as a whole to expand their potential sources of supply by allowing producers in that area, which will be unified from this point of view, to use intermediate products from the whole of the area without any barriers.
We expect this to have a positive effect on trade, contributing to the development of intra-regional trade in particular.
Our aim is to be able to apply this cumulation effectively in all the countries of the area by the end of 2004.
Lastly, the promotion of sustainable development: we must give priority to incentives and respect for multilateral norms.
We must continue to look at how public action can ensure that liberalisation will not be detrimental to working conditions or the environment and prevent non-compliance with social or environmental standards being used as a competitive advantage.
We might, for example, consider increasing tariff preference margins within the Generalised System of Preferences for countries which apply these international standards, or encouraging private programmes for promoting sustainable development, or, again, looking at ways of increasing consumer information on products so as to give the fair trade option to those consumers that want it.
As you can see, and I will end here, the European Commission is very much aware of what is at stake in the textiles and clothing sector in terms of sustainable development, the fight against poverty, industrial and social policy and regional balances within the Union.
It is a sector where the questions of fair distribution of the benefits of trade and globalisation are keenly felt and a sector that offers us the possibility of developing industrial and commercial policies that do justice to all these legitimate concerns.
In the European Commission we have begun a study to identify the categories of products most at risk, the effects of liberalisation on production, its effects on employment in the enlarged Union and its impact in the regions that are the most dependent on textiles production.
Both sides of industry are following these developments very closely with us in a sectoral social committee.
We are also holding talks with the economic and social partners to identify what further measures might be taken to encourage competitiveness in the sector.
Finally, my colleague, Mr Erkki Liikanen, and myself are planning to present a communication on commercial and industrial policy in the textiles and clothing sector after 2005 to the Members of the Commission next autumn and then to Parliament and the Council in order to provide - as is our mission - all the parties concerned with a clear, predictable and coherent framework that will enable them, for their part, to plan their strategies, investments and activities.
We must join forces to show the way forward for the textiles and clothing sector as a whole.
Madam President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to thank you for being here today and for the statement you have just made, which attests to the sensitivity you have shown throughout the years towards the European textile and clothing sector.
In its recent Communication on industrial policy, the Commission acknowledges that the vitality and dynamism of the industry are crucial to Europe's ability to maintain and increase its prosperity and at the same time achieve its social ambitions.
From this statement we can infer the need for a European industrial policy which, in order to be effective, must not only cover the strictly industrial aspects, but must also be a horizontal policy that embraces, amongst others, the social and environmental aspects and above all, trade policy.
And if this is valid and necessary for industry in general, and to preserve jobs, it is even more so in the case of the European textile and clothing industry, which has a turnover of EUR 196 billion every year, involves more than 113 000 businesses, provides work for two million people - or 7.6% of total employment in the manufacturing industry - and is characterised by significant regional concentration.
Although everyone is aware of these figures, I believe they are worth repeating, because they demonstrate the sector's importance.
This is furthermore a dynamic and competitive industry which, thanks to the efforts made in research and technological development, thanks to the design and quality of the products and as a result of its having specialised, has been able to consolidate and increase its influence and importance for the European and the world economy.
It is accordingly worth recalling that the industry in Europe is the world's largest exporter of textiles, ahead of China, and the third largest in clothing, after China and Hong Kong and consequently has enormous export potential, which needs to be developed.
This is precisely why trade policy is so important.
Furthermore, however, this sector faces many challenges, in particular - and this is something to which you also referred - the challenge of the quota restriction as of 1 January 2005, which will mean a radical change in the world's commercial landscape.
The sector is very aware of this, since it is one of the most exposed to the effects of globalisation through the stiff competition it faces due to the lower wage costs and the large export capacity of many developing countries.
Another challenge facing the industry is China's accession to the WTO, and by way of illustration, it is worth recalling those studies predicting that once quantity restrictions are eliminated, China could see a 150% increase in its global textile and clothing exports and could consequently gain 50% of the world market share.
It is therefore crucial for Europe that markets are genuinely and universally opened up, especially in those countries that are particularly dominant and competitive in the textile and clothing sector but which remain closed to European exports, either as a result of high customs duties, in addition to further duties and taxes, or by means of non-tariff barriers that make trade with those countries unviable.
What is needed, Commissioner, for the sector's survival at European level and for the continued existence of the millions of jobs that are at stake is above all a defensive trade policy.
I can therefore only welcome the content of the statement you have just made and simply express my hope that when it comes to discussing your proposals at the WTO, they are truly allowed to prosper.
We know that reconciling the totally legitimate interests of European industry with the need to make the development agenda a reality will not be easy, but you do have this Parliament's full support for achieving this, Commissioner.
Madam President, thank you Commissioner for being here with us today and for the statement you have made.
You should be in no doubt that you have the support of all parliamentary groups, including mine, of course, for all the measures and positions that you have announced for the forthcoming discussions in the World Trade Organisation.
Less than two months ago, Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy held a hearing, at which one of the speakers was the Chairman of Euratex, the textile employers' association, who concluded his speech by asking what we could do to solve the problems facing the textile industry.
From these benches, I now wish to say, in line with the Commission, that these sittings constitute part of the answers that the sector is asking us to provide in order to remedy an extremely serious situation, which I will not go into again, since the Commissioner is fully aware of it.
With regard to issues of market access, the Commissioner has said that until other Member countries demonstrate greater openness, we will not lower tariffs and customs duties.
I should like to ask you whether, since there is such a significant imbalance between the amounts we charge and those charged by other countries, in the event that significant agreements are not concluded in this field, we can once again put forward the idea of increasing customs duties to whatever level we wish on textile products imported from these other countries that are not willing to lower their own.
Lastly, Commissioner, I wish to ask you a very specific question concerning the recognition of industrial property rights.
We are frequently told by representatives of the textile sector that, with regard to some of these property rights, such as design, which is not as visible as others such as trademarks, although countries have signed TRIPs agreements within the World Trade Organisation, they tend not to comply with them.
I should like to ask you whether you intend to take any action on this matter.
Madam President, I also congratulate Commissioner Lamy for agreeing to conduct this debate, which we proposed.
He regrets, however, that it could not finally be resolved, as the central hypothesis was not accepted by the majority parties, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Some of my fellow Members have already commented here on the huge importance of the textile and clothing industry in the European Union, but it should be remembered that this industry is concentrated above all in southern European countries, in less prosperous regions.
I am thinking in particular of two significant areas in Portugal, CovilhÃ£ and the Ave Valley.
It must also be borne in mind, however, that after enlargement we will have to add almost 600 000 more jobs to the two million already included in this sector, and many hundreds of thousands more in areas of industrial production such as Germany and Italy.
We all know that restructuring in this sector has already led many firms to relocate to the east of Europe or to African or Asian countries, and that this has led to an increase in unemployment in the European Union.
We also know that we cannot do without a full evaluation of the social, economic and territorial effects both of the bilateral agreements already signed and of possible greater liberalisation after the current Agreement on Textiles and Clothing expires at the end of next year.
For these reasons, then, we believe that it is essential to adopt an action plan introducing practical measures aimed at maintaining a harmonious, efficient production line.
Support for SMEs, research and professional training should also be increased.
During the current Doha agenda negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), however, it is essential that specific features of the textile and clothing sector be taken into account.
In particular, reciprocity should be guaranteed in future agreements and trading relations between the European Union and third countries in this sector.
The European textile industry can no longer be used as a bargaining chip in other negotiations on the service or hi-tech sectors.
In order to maintain rates of employment and development throughout vast areas of the European Union, customs duties must be kept at their current levels, which are in any case among the lowest in the world.
Neither fresh cuts nor the removal of non-tariff barriers must be accepted in this sector, except on a reciprocal basis, always taking the tariffs actually imposed as a starting-point rather than those made known to the WTO.
I attach the greatest importance to the establishment of some sort of watchdog, made up of representatives of employers, employees and the Commission, to monitor how the situation develops.
This body would function as an early warning system designed to bring any problems arising to a speedy resolution.
Madam President, like many other Members I am very concerned about this lack of planning a such a late stage, when we have known for some time that tariffs were changing in 2005.
I am not convinced that we are hearing answers that are going to deal with the total exploitation that exists in a lot of the textile industries in many countries throughout the world - whether through child labour, poverty wages or whatever.
As has been mentioned, we are already seeing a shift in production from the European Union to other countries.
I was in Athens last week looking at the case of Schiesser-Palco, an underwear producer - they promised me a sample for the Commissioner but the post has not managed to deliver on that!
That company is relocating 500 jobs to Bulgaria.
The workers there resent being seen as a cheap option when they believe that they are already working for poverty wages, but in a high-unemployment situation it is very difficult to resist taking any job that is available.
We are seeing the same sort of relocation through India, Sri Lanka, Latin America and China - where, we are told, the future of textile manufacturing lies.
I am not convinced that we have had an answer yet as to what is possible under current WTO rules, which means that it can be very difficult to resist imports on the current process and production rules, and difficult to differentiate on labour standards and so on. There seems to be a push coming from certain quarters that corporate social responsibility and consumer power should be the key tools in ensuring standards throughout the consumer chain.
It will be left to campaigners like Clean Clothes and No Sweat to make sure that labour and environmental standards are maintained.
I am interested to know exactly what we think is possible under the current WTO rules, and whether the Commission agrees with the Vice-President of Levi-Strauss, who was arguing that ILO standards should be part of all bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will begin by congratulating the Commissioner on his reassuring words of introduction to this delicate matter.
From 1 January 2005, the textile industry will indeed face a great challenge: after that date, quantitative restrictions on access to European Union, United States and Canadian markets will be lifted for all members of the World Trade Organisation.
In other words, WTO members will have almost unrestricted access to those markets.
In accordance with the Doha Development Agenda, the aim of this measure is to channel the liberalisation of international trade in such a way as to benefit developing countries.
The textile industry is very important in these countries. I would mention India, Pakistan and China in particular.
China is a typical case: the World Bank predicts that its textile exports will double in the next five years.
As the Commissioner mentioned, this sector is tremendously significant. The jobs of 2 000 000 people and total revenues of EUR 200 billion depend on it.
After expansion, the number of people employed in this sector will rise to over 2 500 000.
This industry has one of the longest traditions in my country's economic structure.
Portugal is one of the biggest textile and clothing producers in the Union.
Its exports in this sector represent 20% of its total exports.
Portuguese textile products are a feature of all the major world markets, especially in the European Union and the United States.
The Portuguese textile and clothing industry is mainly composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, almost exclusively concentrated in the north of the country.
