As Europe closed its doors, Syria found other allies, notably Iran, which provided not only oil but also a war-like ideology that does nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Europe has now made a strong commitment to the Middle East, and there have been successive diplomatic missions on a regular basis.
Support for the reopening of dialogue with Syria regarding the association agreement forms part of this preventative strategy, because another conflict in this region could be even more devastating.
Let us be under no illusions.
Syria will not break off from Iran in terms of trade, but its highest authorities claim to be prepared to distance themselves from Iran in terms of the Middle East peace process.
This is an important step.
This is a country with a strong and hardline government, where human rights are not sufficiently respected, and my report discusses these problems quite unambiguously.
Having said that, Syria is a great and civilised country that must be treated with respect, dignity and honesty.
It could be a stabilising influence in the Middle East and we need it.
When Mr Siniora was here, he put forward the scenario of a solution to the problem of the Shebaa farms, and there are other possible points of conciliation.
I would advocate that we open up all avenues.
I would like to thank my fellow Members from all parties for their valuable assistance in drawing up this recommendation.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Council I would like to thank Mrs De Keyser for an important report that covers the Syrian situation excellently.
The Council shares many of the concerns expressed in it with regard to Syria.
As Mrs De Keyser says in her report, Syria may have an important role to play in the Near and Middle East 'as a link between the parties in the peace process and a facilitator of a resolution of the regional conflict'.
For this reason, the Council too decided in August to authorise High Representative Javier Solana and the Finnish Presidency to be in contact with all relevant parties that may influence finding a solution to the crisis in Lebanon and the situation in the Middle East more generally.
Unquestionably, these parties also include Syria.
Since the dramatic events of the summer, it has been important to stabilise the situation in Lebanon and regions close to it.
When Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja met with his Syrian counterpart at the end of August the message to Syria was a clear one. We expect Syria to work to implement Resolutions 1559, 1680 and 1701.
Syria should support the national reconstruction process in Lebanon and do its utmost to stabilise the political situation inside Lebanon.
Equipping armies other than the Lebanese and the question of arms smuggling have a fundamental impact on whether a ceasefire can be built on a sustainable basis.
There are also questions that remain unanswered with regard to the demarcation of the border between Syria and Lebanon and the establishment of diplomatic relations.
Solving the complex problem associated with the Shebaa area will likewise require Syria's cooperation.
Syria must also continue to show a desire to cooperate with the Brammertz commission which is investigating the Hariri assassination.
A question that is outside the scope of Resolution 1701 but important for stability in the region is the activity of Palestinian organisations with their headquarters in Damascus and Syrian support for them.
Furthermore, Syria's relations with Iraq and Iran and its activities with regard to these countries have direct implications for the general situation in the Middle East.
The Council is also closely following progress in human rights in Syria.
Especially worrying were the arrests in the spring of those who are defenders of human rights and who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration.
The fact that some of them were recently released is obviously welcome news.
The EU will be closely observing how, for example, freedom of gathering in a public place and freedom of expression are being implemented in the country.
Obviously, Syria must also act in accordance with the principles of international human rights.
The reopening of the Civil Society Training Centre, which has EU support, is an important objective.
The centre was shut in the spring just a week after it had opened.
Continual links with Syria are being maintained, especially via Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
The meeting of Foreign Ministers in Tampere in November, which Syria has also been invited to attend, will provide an excellent forum for discussions.
Syria is an important actor in the Middle East.
It can choose: it can either be a troublemaker or a constructive partner.
Syria's historically strong ties with Lebanon mean that it has an especially important role to play in implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions with respect to the situation in Lebanon.
The Union has continually stressed that Lebanon's right to self-determination, territorial inviolability and political independence must be respected.
In order to bring stability to Lebanon and the entire region it is important that arms smuggling to Lebanon be prevented.
Syria needs to watch its borders to achieve this aim.
The Council has said that it is willing to improve relations with Syria, if the country's behaviour seems to favour this.
The ball is now in their court.
Given the right circumstances, the Union could, for example, reconsider the possibility of signing the Association Agreement.
This would of course promote cooperation between the EU and Syria, especially financially, as well as reforms that are essential for Syria's development, which is the assumption also made in the report.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, first of all I think this is a very timely discussion.
Thank you for putting it on the agenda.
I have followed closely the discussions in the AFET Committee on Ms De Keyser's substantive and comprehensive report.
The report is a fair account of the internal and regional challenges facing Syria.
I welcome this reflection by the European Parliament on the way forward with Syria.
After the conflict in Lebanon and in the new context of United Nations Security Council resolution 1701 (2006), it is indeed the right moment to reassess where we are with our current policy.
Syria is a long-standing partner under the Barcelona process and is a potential candidate for the European Neighbourhood Policy in the medium term.
I share your view that we have a strong interest in bringing that country closer to Europe.
Syria, as we all know, is an essential player for stability in the Middle East.
It is a key part of the puzzle when it comes to finding a long-term solution to the conflicts in the region and also in the implementation of resolution 1701 in full.
In this critical moment for the peace process, Damascus has the power to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.
This means that we expect Syria, as you have stated in the motion for a resolution, to pass the right messages to Hezbollah and Hamas, to prevent arms shipments into Lebanon, as our colleague from the Council has said, and to help with the settlement on the Shebaa Farms.
As I have indicated, I believe that re-engaging with Syria should be part of our strategy.
A different issue is then whether and how far we can re-engage here and now.
The first thing we need in order to re-engage with Syria is for its leaders to show their commitment and their interest in moving forward and taking positive steps on a number of issues.
As you well know, lately we have gone through difficult times in our relationship with Syria.
Ms De Keyser's report addresses a number of the political divergences.
Overcoming the political deadlock depends on the leadership's ability to translate some of its words of goodwill into deeds of goodwill.
Syria has a new opportunity at this critical time for the peace process to demonstrate that it is serious about contributing positively to regional stability.
In the absence of an association agreement, we have limited scope to tackle matters of concern.
Nevertheless, we have tried where we can, and where we feel it is of interest for the people of Syria.
We have tried to continue programmes in those areas that directly benefit the citizens of Syria.
For example, on human rights, the European Union uses diplomatic channels to address the most serious violations, including, for instance, the cases of prisoners of conscience.
We have also reacted to the limitations on freedom of expression and the wave of arrests that accompanied the publication of the Beirut-Damascus declaration last May.
But it is not by cutting off contacts that we will achieve much progress.
With no dialogue, we have no influence.
We should therefore turn the situation around, give a positive perspective to relations with Syria and set out the areas where we expect progress.
We do so in part through our cooperation programmes.
Syria now seems to be well engaged on the road to economic transition and we welcome the approval of Syria's national agenda for reforms sponsored by Deputy Prime Minister Dardari last May.
Support for the implementation of the reform process, including progressive steps to political opening, could be the focus of our action in the next few years, if things go well.
Cooperation under the ENPI - the European Neighbourhood Policy Instrument - will allow us to give Syria the medium-term prospect of full participation in the Neighbourhood Policy.
The ENP will then bring additional benefits and, we hope, a more interesting package for them, when the time is ripe.
As for the association agreement, it is still on the table.
We have finalised all technical preparations and we have initialled the agreement.
Now, it is pending a decision on signature from the Council.
Signature is a process.
So far, political circumstances have not been right.
Member States still expect Syria to take more positive and credible steps to make signature possible, including on regional issues such as Lebanon and Palestine.
Syria's recent statements to facilitate the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701 may be encouraging signs in this respect, as are President Assad's calls for resuming peace talks, which have had some positive echoes in Israel.
Like the European Parliament, the Commission is a strong believer in dialogue.
Therefore, I very much hope that the positive messages that we have received from Damascus lately will be transformed into deeds and that we will be able to restore a strong relationship with that country.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs De Keyser on the draft recommendation that she has presented and on all of the work that she has been doing on relations with Syria.
I believe that it is important for us to consider and place this debate within its most appropriate context, Mr President.
That context, as the Commissioner has said quite rightly, should be an assessment of the situation, on the journey towards an Association Agreement, without forgetting that we must also promote dialogue, parliamentary dialogue in our case, with Syria, given that country's strategic importance within the region's complicated context, as others have emphasised.
I believe, however, that it is also important to stress - and the text of the resolution makes this very clear - that this is not the time for Parliament to pronounce itself in favour of the Association Agreement.
The resolution - the draft recommendation - states quite clearly that the conditions have yet to be met: there must be very clear progress in a number of areas.
Syria's conclusion of a defence agreement with Iran is not good news.
There must be substantial progress in terms of respecting the European Union's traditional thinking in the field of democracy and human rights.
The United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the territorial integrity of Lebanon must be respected and Syria must cooperate in clearing up the assassination of ex-Prime Minister Hariri.
It must also make progress in relation to the abolition of the death penalty, respect for religious minorities, etc.
I therefore believe, Mr President, that there is still a long way to go.
There is some good news, such as Mr Dandari's appointment as Deputy Prime Minister.
I had the privilege of meeting him following a mission in Lebanon.
I believe that only on this basis, as the Commissioner said a moment ago, must we turn this list of good intentions into concrete actions, so that the European Union can give the green light to this important Association Agreement between the Union and Syria.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs De Keyser for her outstanding report, and also Mr Salafranca for his good cooperation, which has made it possible for a report such as this one to be adopted by a large majority.
Syria is not a straightforward country, but a problematic one in a problematic region.
If, though, we want to establish stability and peace in this problematic part of the world, we need Syria to cooperate with us.
Where Lebanon is concerned, it really ought to dawn on Syria, once and for all, that a politically stable and economically strong Lebanon is to its own benefit and does not constitute a danger to it.
Moving on to Iran, we have no objection to make to friendly relations between that country and Syria, for such is only right and proper among neighbours, but this friendship should bear fruit in a constructive contribution, in a peace process, rather than in a blockade.
I do indeed understand that Syria is demanding that Israel return the Golan Heights, but Syria must acknowledge that Israel has security interests that it cannot renounce, and should help facilitate peaceful developments in Palestine and, in particular, in the Gaza Strip, not only in the shape of peace between one Palestinian and another, but also between the Palestinians and Israel.
It is vitally important that we engage in this dialogue, and in that connection I should like to remind the House of an expression that the Commissioner used, namely 'leadership ability'.
I would like to see the President of Syria pay less attention to those whose whisperings in his ear have caused Syria, over recent years, to be led into isolation, but rather to those of his advisers who want to take his country back to a dialogue with the international community, especially with the European Union.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, a crucial obstacle on the road to ratification has arisen, namely the ever-worsening human rights situation in Syria.
Observers regularly denounce the arbitrary arrests, the acts of torture, the blatant discrimination against minorities, the barriers to freedom of expression and of association, and the harassment and imprisonment of people who work peacefully to enhance freedoms in Syria.
I refer in particular to Michel Kilo, Anwar al-Bunni and Mahmoud Issa, who are still being detained for having signed in May the Beirut-Damascus Declaration calling for the normalisation of relations between Lebanon and Syria.
Michel Kilo should have been released on 19 October, but a further charge has resulted in his prison term being extended.
Mr Issa was released on 25 September but was re-arrested just two days ago.
These examples, among many others, demonstrate the lack of a genuine desire on the part of the Syrian authorities to undertake the necessary democratic reforms.
Under these circumstances - as you said, Mrs De Keyser - there is no question of the European Union concluding an association agreement with Syria.
As the Resolution states, an improvement in the human rights situation and respect for democratic values must be a prerequisite for the conclusion of any agreement.
Moreover, it is also important to put in place an effective control mechanism as part of the application of the 'human rights' clause.
This approach should also be applied, inter alia, to Russia and to Turkmenistan, and to a good many other countries too.
The same goes for the consistency of the positions adopted by Parliament.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Madam President, the purpose of the De Keyser report is dialogue and the future normalisation of our relations with Syria.
We see the Association Agreement as a part of this political process.
I stress the word 'political' because, from an economic point of view, the Agreement is much more beneficial for Europe than for Syria.
The suspension of relations with Damascus was a political mistake.
Europe should not have blacklists and should not blindly follow North American ideas on the axis of evil.
Regardless of its regime, Syria is a country that is vital to peace in the region.
Europe must learn to respect the complexity of Syrian society and the many shades of opinion there.
The regime is politically authoritarian, yet has a liberal attitude to the economy, religion and customs.
Pluralism is stifled and constrained, yet it exists in society and in the institutions.
The less the western powers intervene in the region, the more pluralism will be allowed to flourish.
It is a pity that the final version of the report suffers from shades of the colonial era on a number of issues.
For example, it is not up to us to say who is and who is not trustworthy, because we ourselves, rightly, do not accept such opinions from third parties.
It would also be better if it did not cast far-fetched aspersions over non-existent relations between Damascus and Al Qaeda and Sunni fundamentalism.
This ignorance does us no favours.
We owe it to ourselves to be consistent, as well.
Diplomatic relations cannot hinge on the outcome of a criminal investigation.
Evidence pertaining to the crime of the horrific assassination of Rafiq Hariri must be heard in court. Otherwise, our policies run the risk of violating the principle of the presumption of innocence.
In any event, the report is clear on the important issue; it seeks normal relations and that is a good thing.
It is good that the issue of human rights should be at the heart of this normalisation process, but Europe needs to apply the same policy to all other countries, including Israel.
Lastly, it supports the restitution of the Golan Heights to Damascus, an area Syria has never resorted to violent means to recover; this is a proposal supported in UN resolutions.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, like the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I too will be emphatically voting against the De Keyser report during the plenary vote.
Anyone in this House who advises the Council to conclude an association agreement with Syria is giving support to a ruthless minority regime about which it is sufficient to say that the only entities it regards as strategic partners in its region are the Islamic Republic of Iran and Hezbollah.
The present resolution misjudges once again the true nature of the Assad regime where literally everything revolves around the preservation of power.
As a consequence, the rapporteur has succumbed to illusions of possible positive effects of the association agreement on Damascus' internal and external policy.
If I could catch Mrs De Keyser's eye, I should not like to keep from you the opinion held by a recognised Syria expert from my country who has made many visits to that country over the years; he told me, only the other day, in plain words, that 'democracy is considered to be a deadly threat by those in power', and that this is something that has become obvious to him in recent years in discussion with sources within the regime, including with the oh-so-liberal Mr Dardari.
What is so absurd about this report is that the document is full of cautionary words against following the diplomatic false scent in the direction of Damascus.
This is food for satirists rather than for politicians.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) Madam President, we are today discussing an Association Agreement with a country whose significance must be clear to everyone in this House.
This is a country concerning which we have a great number of objections and reservations.
There is no mistaking that Syria is directly or indirectly involved in the smuggling of weapons to terrorist organisations.
There is no mistaking that Syria has close links to Iran.
It is a fact that we have very serious concerns about the standard of Syria's respect for human rights and civil rights.
The question arises as to which instruments the European Parliament and the European Union should use.
Will this agreement promote democracy?
Will it make the instruments at our disposal for bringing pressure to bear on this government more efficient, or will it weaken our position?
I believe that mutual understanding and the possibility of exerting pressure will strengthen our position and that the agreement in question should be supported.
I believe this should be based on the premise that our stance and our opinion as the European Parliament requires respect for human rights and civil rights.
This must be made abundantly clear at every opportunity.
Ceasing to support terrorist activity has to be a sine qua non.
It is essential to apply pressure of this kind, otherwise we shall be infringing our fundamental principles.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, we have to be clear in our own minds about the fact that the crisis in the Middle East - not only where Lebanon is concerned, but also the Middle East problem as a whole - is capable of resolution only if Syria is brought on board, for it, at present, maintains links with Iran and Hizbollah, and thought must be given to how, if at all, these links can be dismantled, and in such a manner that it is in Syria's interests.
Syria is a Sunni and secular state, with relatively little in common, ideologically speaking, with Shiite fundamentalists.
This is what would make it possible for us to make use of an association agreement, provided that improvements are made in the observance of human rights and a solution found to the question of how we and it can join together in combating terrorism.
What is certain is that supplies of weapons to the Lebanon cannot be wholly stopped without Syria's consent, and that must be seen to be a factor.
Such a solution is also conditional upon the problem of the Shebaa farms being resolved.
That is of the utmost importance if Hizbollah are to be denied the excuse that they need to have weapons in the area, since it is Israeli-occupied territory.
For all these reasons, both the situation within Syria and that country's relations with the European Union need to be improved.
The initiative on the part of the Mrs De Keyser and the Committee on Foreign Affairs - of which, it is my impression, both the Council and the Commission take a sympathetic view - makes an important contribution towards Syria being offered the opportunity to secure its own interests and thereby make a constructive contribution to the peace process in the region.
It is evident that the Syrian regime is no friend of democracy, that it violates human rights, that people - both Syrians and others - must be set at liberty and that a stop must be put to the cooperation with the military arms of Hizbollah and Hamas; even so, I do believe that a dialogue of this kind is possible and that the offer of an association agreement, within this framework, can be an effective means to that end.
(FR) Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, I should like to begin by thanking Mrs De Keyser for this excellent report.
The conclusion of an association agreement between the European Community and Syria would constitute a very encouraging political sign in terms of establishing peace in the Middle East, which is something that we all so earnestly desire.
Association agreements are an excellent way to put pressure on countries.
Thus, in return for our economic and commercial cooperation, we must ask Syria to become a democratic country that respects fundamental freedoms; to stop interfering in its neighbours' affairs; to strictly delimit its border with Lebanon; and to stop supporting the Hezbollah militias or the Hamas fundamentalists that it is sheltering.
Syria must release the intellectuals, human rights defenders and political prisoners that it is holding in its prisons.
It must also respect the right of the minorities living on its territory, especially the Kurds, to whom it must offer citizenship, since they do not have it.
If Syria renounced its Greater Syria project and if it turned to allies other than Iran, the entire region would benefit.
Syria, more than any other country in the region, is able to play the role of governor and peacemaker, particularly in relation to the Iraqi and Palestinian issues.
Europe must make every effort to include Syria among its strategic allies in the Middle East.
If the wind of change rose in Syria and if the country practised a policy of openness, then all of the populations in the Middle East could finally start to free themselves from the yoke of dictatorship and theocratic populism.
Madam President, this report asserts that an EU-Mediterranean agreement would give decisive impetus to the political, economic and social reforms needed in Syria, yet the report also deplores the signing of a military agreement between Syria and Iran, which the Syrians say will increase cooperation against what they call the common threat presented by Israel and the USA.
Since 1995 the European Union has given Syria EUR 259 million.
The EU pays millions of euros to support the tyrannical Syrian regime in the hope that somehow it will make them believers in democracy, civil liberties, human rights, etc. The Syrians, on the other hand, now find that they have enough spare cash to be able to afford a military alliance with Iran that will inevitably make the world a more dangerous place.
EU taxpayers' money should not be spent in supporting tyrannical and murderous regimes which are the enemies of democracy, freedom and peace.
Madam President, the EU's strategic interest with Syria is maintaining peace in the wider Middle East so that oil flows, and to steer the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians towards a durable two-state solution settlement, as detailed in Mrs De Keyser's report.
Isolated Syria has for some time been helping Iran launch a combined pan-Islamic offensive on Israel, and Syria seeks to keep the Lebanese Government weak by strongly backing Iran's proxy Hezbollah, which Syria believes will also help re-establish its influence in Lebanon.
Nevertheless, Syria has one redeeming feature: it is a secular country that recoils from Islamic fundamentalism, and parts of the ruling Ba'ath elite worry about Syria's deepening defence alliance with theocratic Iran and Islamist Hezbollah.
Syria no longer needs to cosy up to Iran in its old alliance against their common enemy, Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
Regrettably, hopes are now fading that the EU can deal directly with the Palestinians under an intransigent Hamas, which refuses to recognise Israel or forswear violence.
The time is therefore now ripe to offer assurances to Syria that blocking Hezbollah's re-armament, stopping jihadi fighters' passage into Iraq and improving Syria's appalling human rights record would bring valuable benefits, including the eventual ratification of the strengthened association agreement with the EU.
The EU, as a member of the Quartet, can also help broker an acceptable peace agreement between Israel and Syria over the Golan Heights and the Shebaa Farms where the US may be unwilling.
Israel would gain much by talking to its enemy, Syria.
Conscious of its vulnerability to rocket attacks, Israel knows that it needs a defensible state, safe from external aggression.
Removing Syria as a threat is a key element in achieving this strategic objective.
But I endorse the findings of the report and I am hopeful now that the European Union will look to using its considerable leverage over Syria to achieve these objectives.
(EL) Madam President, I too should like in turn to congratulate my honourable friend VÃ©ronique De Keyser on the very important report which she has presented to us.
I believe that on the basis of the new geopolitical situation which has arisen in the Middle East, the European Union should formulate its own independent strategy.
Syria is a fact and its role continues to be instrumental to regional stability and security.
Europe must talk to Syria and must proceed with a coordinated institutional and political dialogue with the regime in Damascus.
I absolutely agree with everything contained in the report and with what my honourable friends have said.
However, no one has answered the question of how we shall get Syria to change its conduct and how we shall contribute to the democratisation process.
No one has answered that question.
I believe that, without the mechanisms of the association agreement and political dialogue, the potential for the European Union to contribute to the democratisation of Syria is non-existent.
That is why I believe that the European Union should not delay in signing the agreement.
For advocates of the isolation of Syria, of sanctions or even of the overthrow of the regime, the civil war in Iraq is the answer to their delusions.
(CS) Madam President, Commissioner, the decision to renew the ratification of the Association Agreement with Syria is a strategic one.
The situation in the Middle East is more a case of the glass being half-empty than half-full.
The lack of democratisation in Egypt has encouraged the growth of radical forces; Lebanon is sliding into disarray; and the chances of creating a State in Palestine have, for domestic reasons, disappeared.
Relations between the EU and Israel have unravelled since the summer attacks on Lebanon.
There is neither a European nor an Israeli policy, with Israel increasingly sinking back into regionalism, no longer capable of solving problems from a broader perspective.
Furthermore, as the latest decision on Iraq has shown, the USA does not have a serious policy in the region, either.
The end of the policy of playing off one side against the other has undoubtedly served to strengthen Iran.
Iran is the only player with a relevant, active policy.
Iran's intermediary is Syria.
Parliament cannot take any relevant steps in relation to Iran.
That would require a joint approach from the EU, the USA and the Russian Federation.
What we in this Chamber can do is to try to draw Syria out of its submissive role as an intermediary.
That is the strategy.
The tactic is to offer incentives of an economic or international nature, and to do this as a matter of clear, common and uncompromising European policy.
We must make demands from Syria in a similarly clear and uncompromising way.
This is not a matter of appeasement.
The key issue is for Syria to sign up to a gradual lifting of martial law, to the creation of a civil society with full freedom of expression and to respect for minority rights and a transition to a democratic political system based on an open market economy.
Syria must of course cooperate on the investigation into the assassination of Hariri.
It must engage in constructive moves towards solving the peace process.
It must stop arming Hezbollah and supporting armed Palestinian groups, it must comply with Resolutions 1559 and 1701 and it must also complete the withdrawal of all armed forces from Lebanon and establish diplomatic relations.
We do not own the Association Agreement.
What is needed is for Syria to take ownership of it.
Our task is to establish, through the Agreement, a Syrian road map towards transition.
I should like to call on the Commission and chiefly the Council to give active support both to our strategy and to our tactics.
(PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Barcelona Declaration enshrines the objectives of establishing a common area of peace, stability and prosperity through the reinforcement of political dialogue and security, economic and financial partnership, and a social, cultural and human partnership.
This objective has been implemented successfully in recent years, and there are already Association Agreements in place with almost all of the countries of the Mediterranean basin, except, of course, for Syria, for various, understandable reasons.
The EU has always been mindful of the events of recent months.
It must make a genuine commitment to proper negotiations with Syria, with a view to securing the country's firm desire to conclude the Agreement.
Accordingly, Syria will hopefully develop into a democracy that respects human rights and religious freedom, that helps in the fight against terrorism, and that promotes dialogue and lasting peace in the region.
To this end, the Syrian Government must take action to end the state of emergency at the earliest opportunity, with the EU lending all possible assistance.
Syria is in a geostrategically vital location and has a crucial role to play in the Middle East peace process.
The EU must, once and for all, make clear its belief that strengthening democracy cannot be achieved by means of a policy of bombing or isolation.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Syria is a country that cannot be ignored in the context of the Middle East crisis.
Breaking off all dialogue means isolating the country and carries the risk of the regime becoming more radical.
It means pushing Syria even further into the arms of Iran, whose only aspiration is to destroy Israel and to destabilise the region.
If we are to resume talks with Syria now, though, we must be very cautious and lay down firm conditions in advance.
We must demand that Syria respect Lebanon's sovereignty and that it comply with the Security Council resolutions calling on it to step up controls at the Lebanese-Syrian border and to stop supplying weapons to Hezbollah.
We must make respect for human rights and civil liberties a prerequisite for the signing of any agreement.
We must demand that it take concrete action in following up the conclusions of the investigation into the assassination of the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri.
I would point out that this is also a prerequisite for the continuation of the negotiations.
Finally, it must clearly outline to the international community the measures that it is taking to effectively and practically combat the proliferation of weapons and terrorism in the region.
By that, I mean that it must also stop all support to the Hezbollah and Hamas militias.
If the European Union plans to re-open negotiations with Syria, it must do so only if the latter accepts and respects these conditions.
Today, conditions for the signing of any association agreement have not been met, which is something that I deplore.
We must call on Syria to abandon its closed-shop mentality and confront this country with its responsibilities in a region in which all of the actors must work on establishing peace and stability.
Madam President, I should like to endorse the recommendations of Mr De Keyser's report, in particular that it is time to review engagement with Syria by Europe and the world, not to compromise our principles but to advance them.
A strong message needs to be sent to Syria with regard to human rights and improving its record on freedom of expression, torture and abolition of the death penalty.
The human rights lawyer Anwar al-Buni, who, amongst hundreds of others, signed the petition calling for respect for Lebanese sovereignty, should be released from custody forthwith, along with hundreds of prisoners of conscience.
Labelling Syria part of an axis of evil has achieved nothing.
I welcome the fact that in the last month the Commissioner has authorised her representatives to hold discussions with Syria's ministries for Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs and that this week the European Parliament will offer the prospect of signing the association agreement if Syria genuinely chooses to work with Europe to achieve peace in the Middle East.
(NL) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs De Keyser, for her hard work, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my concern in this area, for let us be honest.
We can hardly imagine the European Union, being a Union of values and standards, concluding a cooperation agreement with a rogue state such as Syria.
That, though, is the reality, when one considers the links with Hezbollah and Iran.
The only option is to use a cooperation agreement, and the associated negotiations, as an opportunity to prescribe a number of minimum conditions in the area of human rights, because there is increasing oppression against trade unions, journalists and religious minorities in Europe.
Syrian citizens belonging to religious minorities, as well as Assyrian Christians returning to Syria, are put behind bars almost without exception.
There is therefore every reason finally to bring the EU's immigration policy and return policy to Syria into line with each other at European level, and to suspend return policy to Syria for the time being.
That appears to me to be a first step.
Secondly, we must demand firm guarantees for religious freedom; the Syrian Government must stop interfering with religious minorities in Syria itself, for the various religious communities and ethnic groups are having a particularly hard time at the moment because of the way Syria is managing their interests.
Europe has, in this respect, a reputation to lose, because the European churches are based on the earliest churches that have spread their faith from Syria also in the direction of Europe.
This means that the European Union has the onerous task of ensuring, should a cooperation agreement prove to be the solution at this point, that firm guarantees are demanded for improvement in all these areas.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all thank you for this very valuable debate.
During it, it became clear that the same phenomenon is evident in this Chamber as in the international community and among the moderate Arab countries too, that there are slightly different views about what kind of policy on Syria is the best and most effective to make the country once again a constructive member of the international community.
The European Union has come to the conclusion that isolation will drive Syria in the wrong direction, and the Council specifically discussed this and laid down new policy on the matter at the start of August, so that we would be in contact with all the relevant players to resolve the Middle East question.
Syria is one of the relevant players.
Consequently, I can say, for example in reply to the hope expressed by Mr Swoboda that the Presidency must listen in particular to those that aim to build robust dialogue with Syria, that that is what we have also done.
One example of that is the approaching Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Ministers in Tampere, to which Syria has also been invited.
It is also certainly valuable to build and activate dialogue between parliaments, as Mr Salafranca mentioned in his speech.
The right circumstances and also the right timing are very important in the rewarming of these relations.
Obviously, in the measures that we ourselves are taking we will aim specifically to give Syria the opportunity to play a positive role.
It is very apparent from this discussion that in the search for a solution to the situation in the Middle East everything affects everything else.
Accordingly, over recent months we have actively tried to find a comprehensive, long-term and lasting solution to the Middle East question.
The search has been a very active one.
High Representative Javier Solana is in the region today in fact, and he intends to visit not only Israel and the Palestinian territories, but also Beirut, Jordan and possibly other places too.
In other words, contact with the various parties is very important.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for pushing forward this process of reflection on this strategically vitally important country in the Middle East.
I think this was a very important debate.
Allow me to answer a few very specific questions.
One was on human rights.
In the absence of an association agreement in force, the European Union has no platform for an in-depth dialogue on human rights with Syria where it could also discuss critical issues - and there are many to be discussed - such as the abrogation of emergency rule, the amendments to the laws on politically partisan NGOs, the granting of citizenship to stateless Kurds or the setting-up of a national council on human rights.
I do not think we should make total progress on human rights a precondition for signature.
However, we - meaning the representatives of the Commission and the Member States in Damascus especially - use our political instruments such as dÃ©marches and political declarations to denounce the most severe abuses of human rights.
For instance, we raise with the Syrian authorities the situation of prisoners of conscience, detainees, on a very regular basis; and we also systematically observe the trials at the state security court.
In addition, through our cooperation programmes we are supporting the emergence of an open civil society in Syria.
The Commission therefore launched six micro-projects in January under the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
These target Arab lawyers, women's organisations, refugee organisations, the Kurdish minority and the media, and also promote women's and children's rights.
However, in the present situation of tightening control by the security services, those projects and most training activities have had some difficulty in getting off the ground.
The authorities challenge the legality of these projects in Syria, political NGOs are sometimes tolerated but not always authorised, and we are therefore investigating solutions to these problems.
Of course, we have also raised individual cases directly with the Syrian Government.
With regard to questions of assistance, EU financial assistance has not gone to supporting the regime, as was mentioned earlier by some colleagues here.
It has gone, for example, to supporting the private sector and also the small and medium-sized enterprises.
We have helped the people directly, for instance through health programmes, and we have targeted help at getting reforms to open up the economy and trade, competition and investment - things that will be very important for the future development of the country.
Finally, I would like to reiterate a point I made earlier.
We are in favour of a dialogue with Syria with a political and economic perspective.
We are trying to maintain a positive perspective, building on progress that has already been made, for example in supporting the reforms the government is undertaking to open up the economy that I have just mentioned to and decentralise power.
But at the same time, as I said before, we will be looking at practical action on regional issues such as the implementation of Security Council resolution 1701, and playing a positive role, for instance in Palestine.
This will determine how fast we can proceed with our future engagement, and I see that a great majority in this debate also seems to lean in that direction.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Council Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0437/2006).
We will be taking the following questions to the Council.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, in reply to the question the Council would first like to remind everyone that Article 18(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community states: 'every citizen of the Union shall have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in this Treaty and by the measures adopted to give it effect'.
As the honourable Member certainly knows, the Commission, as the body that monitors the Treaty, must ensure that the provisions of the Treaty and the rules and regulations made by the institutions pursuant to it are complied with.
That being the case, the question by the honourable Member should really be put to the Commission.
In July this year the Commission published a communication aiming at an EU strategy on children's rights with the purpose of promoting and protecting children's rights effectively in internal and external policies of the European Union and supporting measures taken in this area by the Member States.
Decisions on child and family policy proper are taken at national level.
(EL) Madam President, I too wish to take my turn in reminding the Council representative that the Commission may design the strategy, but the application of it is undertaken by the Member States.
In the Council, all the Member States must establish what the situation is and what the problems are of families moving with children; that is why I put this question to the Council, in knowledge of the Treaties and the new Commission communication.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, we all have laws to prevent discrimination against all population groups and ages, such as the Racial Equality Directive and the Directive on discrimination in employment and occupation.
They incorporate rules on such areas as the prohibition of discrimination in many everyday situations.
As for the examples given of, for example, restaurant culture by the honourable Member, we do have to remember that citizens of the Member States, in addition to the Council, have, as consumers and, when it comes down to it, those who are paying for these services, also have considerable powers of influence on what sort of culture should evolve from the perspective of families with children.
(DE) Madam President, I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact that this is a problem not only in Greece, but also in Austria, where it is positively prevalent, and where hotels count it as one of their main selling points that they allow no children, or will not accommodate families with them.
What I would like to know is whether something can be done about this, at any rate as regards advertising.
There are, after all, other areas in which advertising can be restricted, and that might be one possibility.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, it is Council Regulation of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union that provides for the establishment of Frontex and its tasks, structure and the requirements pertaining to its financial administration.
Under the Regulation, the Council is given information concerning the Agency's action programme, the general and special risk analyses that it prepares, an annual general report and the Agency's budget.
Measures to amend the Regulation's provisions may only be proposed by the Commission.
It is primarily the task of Frontex's Management Board to approve measures relating to its organisational structure, staffing policy and action programme, and the Council takes no part in it.
It is still the responsibility of the institutions of the EU to evolve Community policy on the control of external borders and relevant legislation.
Close coordination between the agency and the institutions must therefore be assured, and there are arrangements in existence for this purpose under the Frontex Regulation.
Regarding this, I would refer you to the relevant Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams.
Its purpose is to enhance operative activities undertaken by the Agency and promote solidarity between Member States and the Community during a crisis.
The European Council proposed last December that the Member States, the Council and the Commission should take certain measures before the end of the year to improve practical cooperation among the Member States.
These included strengthened control and monitoring of the EU's southern maritime border and the Medsea study on the Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network, which Frontex has now completed.
In recent months the Council, for example in its session on 24 July and at the informal ministerial meeting in September, has been paying particular attention to improving operative cooperation between the Member States and Frontex, and, in particular, the situation in the Mediterranean region and Africa.
On these occasions such themes as Frontex's role and its participation in operative activities, especially in the Mediterranean and with regard to the African situation, were discussed.
The Council was satisfied with the measures implemented by Frontex and the Commission and stressed that operative cooperation should continue to be developed further.
At the end of October the Council also adopted its conclusions on strengthening the external maritime border in the south.
In its conclusions it urged Frontex to promote a feasibility study on the establishment of a European Surveillance System which, in its initial phase, would cover the whole of the southern maritime border of the Community and the Mediterranean Sea.
The Council also asked Frontex to consider setting up regional centres with links to one another, which would be at Frontex's disposal in operational matters in different maritime areas or sections thereof.
The Council, however, does not have to propose that appropriations should be granted for Frontex's budget for additional action.
According to Article 33 of Council Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union and the Hague Programme, the work of Frontex will be assessed with reference to a Commission evaluation before the end of next year.
(ES) Madam President, the Council's reply has reassured me, and I am going to say something surprising: Frontex has worked.
Despite being at an experimental stage, its work in the Canary Islands, in the large area of sea surrounding the Canary Islands, has been effective.
The concern is the precariousness of the institutions and the lack of economic and financial resources.
The Presidency has referred to that, but the specific question I would like to ask is whether you believe that it will be possible to continue the Frontex operation in the Atlantic after 1 January, and whether the Council believes it is worth spending money on resources, on maintaining this Agency, which, I would repeat, has worked, is still working, and is proving to be effective.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, first it is obviously encouraging to hear that Frontex has been successful.
While we admit that it has also had some problems, or at least challenges, we have to remember that the Agency is still very young and, at the same time, it has its administrative structure and tasks to attend to.
Moreover, it has already been involved in very many operations both in the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere.
Obviously, whether the scope and effectiveness of this operation can continue also depends on additional financing.
(DE) Madam President, the President-in-Office of the Council spoke about how difficult it is to get funding for Frontex.
Frontex is being supported.
Is the Council also considering doing something to relieve the burden, for example mounting information campaigns in the countries of origin, in order to make potential migrants aware of the possible consequences of illegal immigration or of the other options available for legal immigration?
Is it also considering reducing the load by taking action that would make it impossible, in future, to legalise illegal immigrants in the way in which they have been?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, one very crucial question, which relates generally to illegal immigration or immigration as a whole, is obviously the extent to which we cooperate with countries of origin and transit.
Recently in the Union the aim has been to focus special attention on points of contact between immigration itself and development, working on the notion that we should be able to enhance cooperation with countries of departure so that the pressures on people migrating are also lessened in those places.
Of course, one area of this cooperation with countries of origin is to provide information on what is actually possible and what is not.
In November the next high level conference between the EU and African countries will be held in Tripoli and the main theme there will be immigration.
I have two points.
First of all, a few months ago we were hearing about problems around the hosting of the agency in Poland: inadequate provision of accommodation and so on. Have those problems been resolved?
Secondly, will the Finnish Presidency pledge to support and to persuade other Member States to accept the amendments that the European Parliament is about to vote to the budget of FrontEx?
This is Amendment 836, to restore the sum as proposed by the Commission, i.e., not to follow the Council cuts and to put even more resources in reserve.
Will the Finnish Presidency support that increase in resources?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children of November 2004 is at present being debated by working groups in the Council.
Most recently it was discussed by the criminal case cooperation team in October, just a week ago.
An examination of the initiative also forms part of the discussions which the Council working groups are holding on other proposals, such as that for a Framework Decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and that for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States.
There are thus two other proposals for framework decisions on the table.
The aim which these instruments have in common is to create structures to ensure that details on someone's criminal background are available generally and readily.
When all the Member States have eventually implemented these acts in their national legislation, it should be easier to prevent a convicted individual from working with children or committing crimes against children once again.
The Council is therefore continuing to debate these proposals for framework decisions.
It seems to me that the Council is going nowhere fast on these proposals.
Nearly two years ago we had an ambitious programme from the Commission in response to strong public interest in ensuring that criminals, like sex offenders, are not the ones who exploit borders and profit from them.
It seems to me that Member States are not getting their act together on this.
I do not understand how we can tell our public that the EU is effective in combating crime if the Council is so slow in deciding on these top-priority measures to make sure that criminals are truly tracked, wherever they go.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, the protection of children, especially from the possibility of new assaults by those convicted of sex crimes, is obviously vitally important.
There are, however, many very practical problems, as well as problems relating to principles, attached to these proposals for framework decisions, for example, the fact that this ban on occupation principle does not even exist in all the Member States.
We therefore need to look for a way of dealing with the problem which can be applied in all the Member States of the Union.
(PT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for the information.
My question is very precise and direct, so that we can judge your position.
Does the Council, that is to say, the Finnish Presidency, not believe that citizens having access to personal data on those convicted of paedophilia or sexual violence against young people is an excellent tool in the fight against crime of this nature?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, this is an aim we all share: children can be protected from convicted individuals and there are different ways of doing that in the Member States.
For example, in my country there is a system in place where an employer has the right to obtain the criminal records of those seeking or applying for certain kinds of job and to use them to consider whether the person is suitable for the job.
Such jobs, however, are very precisely defined.
There are different ways of doing this in the Member States, and that is one reason why progress in this matter has been slow in the opinion of many Members of Parliament.
I should like to refer to a specific case as a means of illustrating that the sharing of information is not enough.
Paul Hunter Redpath is a convicted paedophile who served the custodial part of his sentence in my constituency of Northern Ireland and then recently took refuge in the Republic of Ireland, in breach of the probation part of his sentence.
He can now live there freely, and is unable to be arrested, whereas in Northern Ireland the penalty for breaching his probation order would be an immediate return to prison.
Is this case not a clear indication that full extradition arrangements are needed, otherwise justice will be evaded and full protection not afforded to the vulnerable?
Can the President-in-Office accept that proper extradition is the optimum requirement?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(FI) Madam President, this Question Time slot is obviously not about what I can personally endorse, but what sort of discussions and decisions the Council should aspire to.
The Council, however, now intends to proceed in accordance with the assimilation principle, which means that a Member State would be obliged to attach to convictions in a foreign court legal effects that are equivalent to those which they attach to national convictions, although this is ultimately very much to do with wider cooperation on justice and home affairs and how we can otherwise make progress in the area of mutual recognition of convictions and judgments and the matter of extradition.
Since its author is not present, Question No 4 lapses.
Subject: Aviation sector
Can the European Council outline what new measures it intends to pursue to improve passenger safety on European airlines in light of the ongoing threat of international terrorism?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security represents the Community's current legal framework in the area of civil aviation security.
The Regulation, which was made as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, has been in force since January 2003.
To correct the problems which emerged in the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission put forward a proposal in September 2005 to replace the Regulation with a new one.
In March of this year the Council adopted a general approach on the Commission proposal.
In June the European Parliament adopted its position at first reading, which contained 85 amendments.
On the basis of this, the Council achieved political consensus on the proposal on 12 October.
The adopted text is to be formally reinforced as a common position in a future Council session and submitted to the European Parliament, so that consensus can be swiftly reached at second reading.
In consideration of the security problems experienced by the United Kingdom in August this year, the Council hopes that the institutions will reach consensus on the new Regulation as quickly as possible.
The impact of the new security measures recently introduced by the Commission and its committee for civil aviation security should, in addition, be monitored continually.
Is the Council satisfied that there is enough cooperation between EU Member States in the fight against international terrorism?
Do you agree that Europol and the EU Anti-Terror Office are being adequately funded?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, naturally we can always improve our efforts in the fight against terrorism.
A lot of measures have of course been taken, especially in recent years, but there is always definitely room for improvement.
(LT) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, most of us arrive here by air.
I cannot remember even one case over recent years when aircraft were not delayed by a half-hour or an hour.
Usually, the reason given is security issues.
Could the reason be - and perhaps this really is the case - poorly organised and performed work?
Will we still be able to verify whether security requirements are truly being applied after adoption of this document?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, as well as decision-making it is obviously very important that we monitor implementation and also continuously monitor changes in the operational environment.
It is also vital, of course, that we are able to establish identical rules for different airports and different Member States.
Obviously, good predictability will definitely enable us in everyday practical circumstances to tell beforehand how much time security checks, for example, will take up and thereby reduce the amount of inconvenience caused to passengers.
I nevertheless think that we who travel very regularly also need to get used to the fact that air travel has become a more challenging occupation than before.
(DE) Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like - in my capacity as rapporteur on the extension of the powers of the European Air Safety Agency - to report to you that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has, with reference to this subject, also discussed the possibility of entrusting the EASA with security functions.
I would be interested to know what the Presidency of the Council thinks about that idea.
Now for my second question.
Something that has struck me personally is that the privatisation of security checks at airports has had the consequence that these are less able to deal with extreme situations than, for example, the police.
Would it not make sense to reverse this privatisation and have security checks carried out once more by state agencies?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, at the request of the Irish Government, the Council altered the rules on language in June 2005 and added the Irish language to the list of official and working languages of the European Union institutions.
The Council decided that the institutions would not have to draft all legal provisions in Irish or publish them in this language in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This decision is therefore a departure from the rules.
It will remain in force for five years and that period may be renewed.
It was also decided that the derogation would not apply to the regulations made in the codecision procedure.
In accordance with the decision to add Irish to the list of working languages, the Council has taken all the necessary practical steps to ensure that there is due implementation of the decisions as from 1 January 2007, when the Regulation comes into force.
I thank the President-in-Office for her reply.
Can I take it that, apart from the derogation mentioned, the Irish language will be given equal treatment with all other languages of this Parliament?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, as I said, the Irish language has been added to the list of the official and working languages of the European Union on the strength of the derogation which I have just referred to.
Parliament will itself also have the right to decide how it will in practice implement this.
When I said, however, that the Council has taken all the necessary steps to implement the decision, that refers to many sorts of practical issues and in my first answer I did not want to describe in detail everything that will be taking place there, but everything that this decision requires.
- (LT) I have a question for Mrs LehtomÃ€ki concerning the future; while having 21 official languages in the European Union does, of course, reflect our precious national diversity, it is, on the other hand, becoming costly and increasingly complex.
What do the Council and the country holding the Presidency think about the future?
Will this circle continue to expand or will some measures perhaps be applied to simplify language-related procedures?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, like the honourable Member, the Council is worried about tighter press censorship in China.
At all the rounds of the EU-China human rights dialogue held twice a year, the European Union has systematically and repeatedly urged China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which contains rules on freedom of expression.
It has also encouraged China to lift travel restrictions on foreign journalists and made other demands that relate to interviewing Chinese citizens.
This issue was raised at the round of talks on 19 October in Beijing as part of the EU-China human rights dialogue.
(NL) Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, when the freedom of the press is curbed in some poor African country, then the Council is the first to denounce this in the sharpest terms and to threaten sanctions.
When it happens in China, people simply express their concern.
This has all the hallmarks of double standards.
My question is specifically: will the violation of the freedom of press in China once again feature on the agenda at the next EU-China summit?
Secondly, what specific measures will you be taking in order to actually demand that China's freedom of press and human rights in general be upheld?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, at its meeting in June 2006 the European Council welcomed the progress that had been made in talks relating to the proposal put forward by the Commission in July last year for a Regulation establishing a European Agency for Fundamental Rights and a proposal for a Council decision empowering the European Agency for Fundamental Rights to pursue its activities in areas referred to under the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union, which is to say cooperation on justice and home affairs.
The European Council asked for the necessary measures to be implemented as soon as possible, so that the Agency could be set up and so that it could start operations on 1 January 2007.
In accordance with the European Council conclusions, the Finnish Presidency held a number of bilateral meetings in July, August, September and October with the aim of resolving the main question still unanswered, namely extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union.
At a Council session in early October the Presidency presented a review of the talks that had been held and asked for support for the idea of extending the work of the Agency to areas covered by the third pillar in the Treaty on European Union, but in a more restricted format than in the Commission's original proposal.
The majority of the delegations that presented their view supported this approach by the Presidency, although some wondered whether a proper legal basis for the move would be found.
The Presidency is continuing to look at the options and will put forward an interim proposal to the delegations in the near future.
As regards the Agency's competence, the aim of the Agency is to provide advice and expertise on fundamental rights to Community institutions, bodies and agencies when they are applying Community law, and in this way help them guarantee a respect for fundamental rights when they implement measures or determine policy within the context of their competences.
There is general consensus that establishing such an agency would create added value for EU policy on human rights and increase its coherence.
The Agency will also be the main point of contact in the European Union for matters relating to fundamental rights.
It will discharge its duties, complementing the work of the Council of Europe and in synergy with it, if the decisions on establishing it are taken.
The points you have raised reflect the concern that many of us in Parliament have that, once we propose this agency, the initial role we had envisaged for it will be diluted until it ends up as a think-tank or a contact point that would merely be distributing information from one Member State to another, rather than taking a leading role in defending fundamental rights.
Maybe you could enlighten us as to whether that is a true interpretation of what you have been outlining concerning the bilateral meetings.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, first it has to be said that it is intended that this Agency should be an advisory, expert body.
We also of course believe, however, that it would be difficult to justify to our citizens the establishment of a Fundamental Rights Agency which would be denied the right to exercise the key competences necessary to do its job and undertake action under the third pillar.
Accordingly, the work on this issue continues.
It seems to me that the Member States are muddling their way through to creating an agency that will not have within its responsibilities the very subject area where EU action is most likely to cause problems with regard to human rights.
I have a further question: does the Council not agree that we seem to be creating more and more agencies, like confetti sprinkled around the Member States, so that everybody has one, rather than when there is a real need - not so much this one, perhaps, but many of the others that have been created?
All of them have a top-heavy structure with a management board with representation from every Member State and an administration that is sometimes smaller than the management board.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, the Council is committed to doing more to build long-term relations with Iran based on trust and cooperation.
Improved relations will mean progress in all the problematic issues, among which are human rights, terrorism, Iran's attitude to the peace process in the Middle East and local matters there, and Iran's nuclear programme.
In the matter of Iran's nuclear industry, the Council has many a time said it was committed to a diplomatic solution, which would take account of the international concern about Iran's nuclear programme, but at the same time confirms Iran's right to the peaceful utilisation of nuclear power in accordance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Regarding this, the Council stated on 17 October that it greatly valued the perseverance with which High Representative Javier Solana has since June encouraged Iran to respond to the demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency's governing board and the UN Security Council and continued talks on long-term arrangements.
The EU views seriously the IAEA's evaluation that it has not been able to make any progress in almost four years of continued close monitoring in its efforts to confirm the accuracy and scope of Iran's announcements regarding the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme.
The EU is also very worried that Iran has not ended all its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as the IAEA's governing board and the UN Security Council have asked.
The Security Council stated in its Resolution 1696 that it intended to implement relevant measures under Article 41 unless Iran complied with the demand.
The Council accordingly is of the opinion that, if Iran continues its uranium enrichment activities, the Union will have no other alternative but to back talks on these sanctions.
The Council this month stated that the door to the negotiating chamber was still open for Iran, and urged the country strongly to opt for the positive approach that had been proposed for it.
The EU's High Representative put forward to Iran on 6 June proposals drawn up by six countries.
These far-reaching proposals would form a basis for a long-term agreement and would give Iran everything it needs to develop its current civil nuclear energy sector, and they also take account of international concerns.
Opting for this positive approach would prepare the way for new relations with Iran, which could be based on mutual respect and extended cooperation in politics and economic matters.
The Council hopes that progress can be made along this enlightened path.
I can see that you are trying to have confidence-building measures between Europe and Iran, to try to better relations between the two of them and act as honest broker in this serious situation; but the idea of sanctions does not really work.
It did not work in Iraq and it is not going to work in Iran.
It is quite a wealthy, oil-rich country and they will just carry on.
It may affect them somewhat, but it is not going to affect them that much in the long run.
There are certain issues that you touched on yourself.
One of these is the shipment of heroin out of Afghanistan through Iran, and considering that there are about three million heroin addicts in Iran and they have lost about 3000 troops on the border trying to stop this going on ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, the Council agrees that trade could have major significance in bringing India and Pakistan closer together.
In its conclusions in February 2004 the Council repeated that it supported efforts to promote regional cooperation within the framework of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and especially the agreement on establishing a free trade zone in South Asia by the year 2006.
The EU is pleased with the recently signed South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), but understands that some Member States of SAARC still have unresolved bilateral issues.
Resolving these would give the Member States of the Association the opportunity to derive full benefit from the agreements they are signatories to.
Generally speaking, the EU still supports all the efforts being made to facilitate trade in multilateral contexts as they are an important way to strengthen trade and investment links between the different countries.
The decision by the SAARC ministerial council to confer on the EU the role of observer is a splendid opportunity to develop cooperation between SAARC and the EU.
Cooperation between the two was discussed at the Seventh EU-India Summit in Helsinki on 13 October.
The EU wants to improve the practical support it gives to SAARC.
The Commission has already drafted a programme on economic cooperation with SAARC.
The programme covers facilitation of trade, standards and cooperation between new businesses.
The aim is to promote trade within the region by aiding the implementation of SAFTA, and this, it is hoped, will provide the impetus for improved political relations in the region.
The SAARC Secretariat and the Member States of the EU intend to adopt this programme in the near future.
The Union is encouraging broad dialogue between India and Pakistan and hopes that trading and other relations will develop favourably, because that would promote stability in the whole region.
We welcome the fact that there have been moves to increase trust between India and Pakistan recently, as a result of which freer contacts between people, direct bus and train connections and visits by members of parliament and sports teams have become possible.
The Indian and Pakistani presidents met in Havana this September.
Relations between the two countries were discussed at general level at a summit meeting held on 13 October.
First of all I would like to thank the Council Presidency for the very detailed response to the question I tabled.
I would, however, like one further specific piece of information.
This goes back to my original question as to whether the particular issue in relation to Pakistan/India and Kashmir was actually specifically discussed at the EU Summit with India in Helsinki.
The reason I ask that is because both those nations are having detailed discussions at Foreign Secretary level on 14 and 15 November.
Is there a specific message to them from the Council?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, I was indeed present most of the time at this summit, but I do not remember how the Kashmir question arose.
I have had it confirmed to me, however, that this question was touched upon as part of the issue of regional stability and the situation in the region.
(LT) Madam President-in-Office, I have a question in relation to next week's visit of the delegation of the European Parliament to Kashmir by invitation of the Indian government.
What do you think the major states, primarily the United States and Russia, contribute to solving the problem of Kashmir and what else could the European Union do in this context?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, the honourable Member raises an important issue in this question.
The Council, and the Council since the amendments made to the Treaty, together with the European Parliament have delivered an extensive Community code in the area of safety and security at work.
The Member States are responsible for implementing this code.
The Council welcomes the fact that in the case referred to in the honourable Member's question, the Italian and Polish law enforcement agencies cooperated to close down the work camps referred to.
Although we, like the honourable Member, are concerned about this, it has to be said that responsibility for overseeing implementation of Community legislation in the Member States lies with the Commission, not the Council.
(PL) Madam President, I have a question for the Presidency.
Would it not be possible to activate mechanisms, perhaps through EUROJUST, that would facilitate the creation of a special monitoring unit, particularly in cases of suspected cooperation between local authorities, and even local police, and the organisers of criminal activities, such as the labour camps for citizens of Central and Eastern Europe?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, the Community code that exists for this sector and the secondary legislation that has been added to it demands a guarantee of equal treatment of nationals of other Member States with regard to working conditions.
It is a question of monitoring it, which is the task of the Member States' own authorities.
In accordance with the principles of the rule of law and good governance, in the Union we have to expect these supervisory bodies also to act in accordance with the regulations, and insist on it.
- (LT) Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, I would like to ask whether such camps in fact create a source of restriction for the free movement of persons.
This is the situation the old Member States were in after the introduction of a transitional period for the new ones.
By applying such a transitional period in Romania and Bulgaria, is it not encouraging illegal work?
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Madam President, the Member States take decisions on whether to apply transition periods for new Member States regarding the free movement of the workforce.
There were also Member States which applied a period of transition in the previous round of enlargement, but no longer do so in this new round.
The reason is the perception that it is still better for a workforce to move within the framework of common European rules than create arrangements for derogations.
As I said in my answer to a previous question, equal treatment of the workforce is very well regulated, but of course we have to pay more and more attention to implementation and supervision.
(DE) Madam President, my criticism is not directed at you, for I hold the way you run Question Time in high regard, but I really would like you to cast your mind back to Monday, when we determined the order in which business was to be conducted this week.
The Conference of Presidents envisaged that Question Time would last one and a half hours; then the President reduced it to an hour.
Several Members protested at this, and there was no vote on it, and so I have worked on the assumption that we have available to us for Question Time the hour and a half that we are rightly due.
I would like to ask whether the Council might remain for another quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, or is there a trade union for Council presidencies that forbids them from answering questions after seven in the evening?
Questions to the Council used to begin after 9 p.m, and that worked like a dream, with the Council staying until the following day.
To sum up, I think there is something wrong with this way of going about things.
Mr Posselt, much as I am delighted by your compliment, you are wrong about our debate on Monday, since it concerned the agenda rather than the Rules of Procedure, and it was the agenda that was the subject of a vote.
You can check that again in the Minutes.
We should all take Question Time seriously - or more seriously than we do - as an important prerogative of Members, and we should all work together to ensure that it is not dropped from the agenda too frequently.
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Nairobi Conference on Climate Change (debate)
The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Karl-Heinz Florenz, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Nairobi Conference on Climate Change B6-0440/2006).
Îember of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, the twelfth conference of the contracting parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Nairobi is the first such conference to be held in sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest area on the planet with which the European Union maintains particular political relations.
It is therefore only natural that the conference should focus on the needs of developing countries.
The European Union will stress in particular that combating climate change may be combined with fast economic development and, furthermore, that policies to reduce emissions must be incorporated into decision-making procedures in crucial sectors.
The development of the economies of the countries of Asia, Africa and South America, a secure energy supply and improved air quality are, for example, important - parallel - benefits of actions to combat climate change.
I believe that improving the understanding, at international level, of the dangerous repercussions of climate change and the show of interest in addressing the needs of developing countries will increase the potential for us to reach an agreement on the period after 2012.
The European Union has four specific priorities in Nairobi.
Firstly, to achieve agreement on the institutional framework for the Adaptation Fund. The fund will be financed from levies on the clean development mechanism and is expected to disburse more than EUR 350 million between 2008 and 2012.
Secondly, to achieve agreement on the list of activities within the framework of the five-year programme of work on adaptation.
The programme contains a series of activities aimed to improve our adaptability, such as further improvement of our knowledge about the negative repercussions of climate change, its socio-economic repercussions and the weak points of our economies and societies to climate change.
Thirdly, to facilitate greater access to the clean development mechanism by the poor countries of Africa and other areas of the planet.
We need to address the question of the fair distribution of projects under the clean development mechanism, because only a small percentage of all the projects are destined for Africa.
Fourthly, the debate on the period after 2012, which will continue, without being completed in Nairobi.
I truly believe that we still have a great deal of work in store.
There are various opinions as to what should be done.
The developing countries do not feel comfortable with the prospect of having to step up their efforts to combat climate change.
At the same time, numerous developing countries continue to hesitate to take the necessary measures to reduce emissions which are required in order to help limit the average rise in temperature on the planet by two degrees Celsius.
In Nairobi, the European Union will justifiably continue to maintain that the fight against climate change and the millennium development goals, are not only mutually compatible but also mutually dependent.
In Nairobi we hope to secure, on the one hand, a clear, specific and balanced approach and stable progress in the ad hoc working party on Article 3, paragraph 9, on the dialogue being held within the framework of the convention and, on the other hand, agreement on how the Kyoto Protocol will be revised on the basis of Article 9.
However, we need to look beyond Nairobi, given that Europe needs to step up its efforts in order to persuade its partners throughout the world to continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions after 2012.
It is very positive that 10 members of Parliament will be joining the delegation and I personally look forward - as over the last two years - to close cooperation with them.
I shall ensure that they are fully informed and shall pass all the available information on to them immediately.
We shall address the media together and I hope that the Members of Parliament will have contacts and dialogues with delegates from other countries during the conference.
In this way we shall be able to transfer to a global audience our ambition and joint vision for a sustainable future for mankind.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his well-chosen words here this evening.
I am delighted to be one of the ten MEPs in the European Parliament group in the EU delegation.
We are all members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and we will be led by our colleague, Mr Blokland, as our vice-chairman.
I had expected my colleague, Mr Florenz, to be leading on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but I do not see him.
Part of his question was to put down yet again a marker in the sand about the fact that the members of the European Parliament's delegation, as part of the EU delegation, will be treated as second-class citizens.
I know the Commissioner will tell us the tale about interinstitutional agreements, the Council, the Commission, precedence and practice.
Frankly, we are all sick of hearing that and we do not want to hear it any more.
The Commissioner is always excellent on these occasions and gives very generously of his time, as do his officials.
They brief us extremely well after the event, outside the door, but we are never let in, not even as observers at the high-level meetings.
I should like, on behalf of my PPE-DE Group colleagues and, I suspect, all colleagues, to be treated on a par with both the European Commission and the Council delegates who will be there.
If the Commission calls it an EU delegation, then the three EU parties who are present should be treated equally.
The Commissioner told us at a recent briefing that he does not expect spectacular breakthroughs.
This will be another interim COP, COP 12-MOP 2 if you like, but it is very important, as this is the first meeting on sub-Saharan Africa.
The Commissioner mentioned the need to extend CDMs.
At the moment only 2.5% is spent in Africa in this area and that is mainly in Morocco and South Africa, and none in the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa as such.
A lot of work needs to be done there.
I am very interested in looking into the creation of a carbon fund for Africa, as the Commissioner has suggested, and where that will take us.
Who will finance the Adaptation Fund?
The argument is about whether GEF will be the main source of funding and where that is going to be.
In Montreal it was agreed that there would be two tracks in the negotiations: one for the UNFCC framework and the other for the Kyoto Protocol.
I believe this clarifies where different countries stand.
Together we can make progress, bring in more of the developing countries and persuade more of our friends in the United States in particular to join us in the very important task of reducing carbon emissions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Al Gore has been travelling the world, spreading his message, for some time.
The climate is changing quickly, more quickly than expected.
Ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising and we will soon reach the point of no return.
That is when a political answer is expected.
We should not simply cry in Al Gore's arms, but also start looking for a solution.
Nairobi presents us with an opportunity for meeting this challenge head-on.
When we discuss the energy crisis and climate problems, we should not be overcome by pessimism, because solutions are possible.
Where can we find these solutions?
First of all by trusting our own measures.
I should like to take this opportunity to express once again my support in favour of the emissions trading system, even if it is far from perfect.
I am, above all, talking to the Commission, who should ensure that the national allocation plans are credible and that over-allocation is a thing of the past.
In the longer term, we must consider auctioning emission rights as an option, because this is how we can prevent the windfall profits in electricity companies and the all too generous allocation of free emission rights.
Secondly, I would argue in favour of a large-scale investment in the development of new, clean energy.
Apart from existing initiatives, there is much scope for innovation.
There is the blue energy, harnessed by mixing salt and fresh water, that can produce energy.
Or the ladder mills with high-level kites that work as windmills and generate energy.
Other alternatives include energy-producing greenhouses and houses, geothermal energy and solar mirrors; so much can be done.
We must capitalise on these possibilities by means of technological innovation.
This must be funded by governments but, in time, also by auctioning emission rights.
Thirdly, we must be pro-active in cooperating with countries such as China, which opens a new power station every month and needs clean coal technology, which we must supply.
Thanks to the transfer of technology, China may well take on board obligations after 2012.
If China joins in, participation from the US will also be more likely.
Fourthly, we must invest generously in the adjustment fund.
Europe has the historical responsibility of climate change, and it is up to us to help the developing countries to adjust to its implications.
Climate change is not always a popular subject in developing countries.
A leader of a developing country - Mr President, I had been given an extra minute, because Mrs Ferreira had generously given me her speaking time, which gives me a total of three minutes - once said to a Dutch environment minister: 'First, we will become as rich as you, and only then will we worry about climate change as much as you do.'
I think that things could be done differently.
They could become rich without CO2 emissions.
Europe has the duty to help them achieve this, and we must, in Nairobi, show them that we really mean it.
Commissioner, I am looking forward to an excellent group effort during the Nairobi conference.
Needless to say, I wholeheartedly support Mrs Doyle's appeal.
I think that we must be involved in all negotiations as much as possible and have maximum access to the meetings, and I know that you will do your level best in this respect.
I should like to close by repeating that I hope for good cooperation.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for coming to speak to such a packed house about the most important subject facing the planet!
You suggested before that this conference of the parties in Nairobi is a bit of a marking-time sort of meeting, that the lateral events might be as important as the main ones.
But we have often heard that, with every month that passes, the problems become greater and more difficult to resolve.
So perhaps we cannot afford to have any more intermediate events: the stakes have to be raised and you have to try and extract everything you can from every possible meeting.
I would like to raise three particular issues.
First of all, transport emissions within the European Union.
According to current figures, five of the major car manufacturers are going to reach the voluntary agreement target of 140g of CO2 by 2008, but 75% are not on target to reach that.
Just remember what that means.
They signed a voluntary agreement with the Commission, with the European Union.
In their own private boardrooms they have looked at the figures and recognised that they could make more profits out of SUVs and four-wheel drives, and they have deliberately decided that they are not going to fulfil that commitment.
They have torn it up, they have not shown good faith and it is now time for the Commission to clamp down really hard.
We know from the five who are meeting the target that there is nothing special about 140g.
You need tough action, and I hope that will be forthcoming in the next few months.
Secondly, the national allocation plans.
I know that you are sending the national allocation plans back to the Member States and saying that a 15% margin between allocations and real CO2 emissions is far from good enough.
This is an impossible situation.
You know that this is the most important instrument.
You need to be tough and to use every resource the Commission has at its disposal to emphasise that national governments have to act on the fine speeches they make in Council.
Finally, looking ahead to the post 2012 emissions trading scheme, how are you going to make it work in future?
Free allocations were a good start, but proved pretty weak in practice.
Auctioning will still give windfall profits to some of the major power generators.
You think you have to start looking at benchmarking, which is very difficult.
But you need to tell industry now across the whole of Europe that we are going to reward best practice and it should start investing now in making a difference to our planet.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the message that we are receiving from the world of science is becoming ever more serious: the more recent the study, the more serious the message from science is on accelerated climate change.
We are approaching a threshold, past which major disasters are unavoidable.
That is what British Foreign Minister Margaret Beckett said and she went on to say we are heading for climate chaos.
At the same time the economic analyses show that very ambitious emission reductions are very reasonable in terms of cost and they will of course be a lot cheaper than letting climate change run riot.
Public awareness of this is growing, reflected, for example, in the opinion expressed by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) that Europe must reduce its emissions by 75% by the middle of the century and it cannot wait about for the others to follow.
Even in the United States of America public opinion is changing.
That is evident from the huge success of Al Gore's film, long articles in the big newspapers on climate change and its possible solution, and, most recently, the latest issue of Scientific American on energy without coal.
In this situation what we really need is leadership on the part of the EU.
In the United States too, those who desire responsible climate protection look to Europe, and what Europe does encourages them.
We must be worthy of this trust.
Neither can we be content in the context of international talks with waiting and wasting time.
We have to draft our own constructive proposals on what the world should do after 2012.
Within Europe too, we have to make our own emission reduction commitments and take action in line with the aim to prevent the world from heating up by more than two degrees.
We also need to implement our own commitments under Kyoto, and, with regard to that, the emissions trading system is very important.
I urge the Commission to be strict.
It is not enough that emissions are traded; emissions trading must also result in a reduction in emissions in the way described in the Kyoto Protocol.
Business also needs European leadership.
So that it can invest wisely it needs long-term emission reduction targets.
The wrong investments will become very expensive.
The lifetime of a power plant is 40 years.
Power plants that are hostile to the climate should no longer be built at all.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, there is no doubt in anyone's mind that climate change is for real.
The average temperature is rising every year, and this year, unfortunately, was no exception.
That is why last week, Prime Ministers Balkenende and Blair wrote a letter to the Council Presidency requesting for practical action.
I quote from their letter: 'We only have ten to fifteen years to take the steps that are needed to prevent us from going beyond the point of no return'.
I should like to find out what steps we can expect very shortly, as time is pressing.
I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner for the energy efficiency action plan that was published last week, although I should like to add in this connection that the target percentage of 20% is, first of all, too low and secondly, will never be met if it is not combined with reduction targets for the Member States.
As Mrs Doyle and Mrs Corbey have already said, the delegation from this House insists on the climate conference pledging that we finally be admitted to all the meetings that are organised by the EU delegation.
Commissioner Dimas knows this and we count on his support in order to achieve this.
We are an official EU institution and are therefore just as much entitled to attend those meetings as are the others.
Mr President, as we prepare for the next conference on climate change in Nairobi, what is most urgently needed is honesty.
It is true that we are proud of the progress we have made so far, but what is the outcome in terms of overall emission reductions?
The world needs efficient climate policies that deliver and not unfounded complacency.
We all know and agree that we need to move from one-sided EU climate politics to a global front, as only truly global action will lead to efficient emission reductions.
Therefore, for the sake of the climate and to really win the battle, let us be honest when analysing the problems arising from the Kyoto Protocol, as well as from the EU ETS preparing for Kyoto.
I am afraid that the headlines have already been written: 'Nairobi was a success and the EU leads the way'.
But is this the right way?
Understandably for the EU, it is politically important to stand in the front line and to show a good example, encouraging others to follow sooner or later.
However, unless the front cannot be widened, the EU efforts will be like taking a few drops out of the ocean or having a haircut to lose weight.
What makes this especially challenging is the effect that one-sided efforts have on the markets.
In the global markets, this means giving the competitive advantage to the polluter, as the cost of environmental investments and emission rights cannot be included in the prices.
The temptation is for the international capital of the global markets to be invested where there are neither emission restrictions nor environmental norms.
A pollution shift is not a pollution cut.
Interestingly, the last conference on climate change in Montreal was publicly described as a victory.
Looking at the results, however, there is not much reason to celebrate.
In terms of emission reductions, not a single step forward was taken in Montreal.
There is no implication that the mitigation front would be widened.
With the Kyoto Protocol, only a quarter of global emissions are controlled.
That is not enough.
Mr President, Commissioner, climate change is no longer speculation, it is a fact.
As is the prospect of a countdown to unprecedented catastrophe for further generations if the present unacceptable situation continues.
The time has come for brave and bold decisions that will bring about drastic measures which can secure significant results.
The EU has in the past taken a leading role in this field, and the UN Nairobi Conference presents our opportunity and our duty to press for concrete and effective action.
We no longer have the luxury of waiting for those who still need convincing, or continuing to tolerate those who simply do not care.
In my view at least, the following two points must be included in our Nairobi strategy: firstly, strict emission reduction targets must be set and severe penalties must be envisaged and implemented for those who fail to meet them; secondly, the international community must isolate those countries that have not signed the relevant conventions and are not willing to cooperate in the joint fight against climate change.
Here I am referring particularly, of course, to the United States, which alone is responsible for one third of global carbon dioxide emissions.
The stance of the USA is represented by the extraordinarily selfish and inconceivably arrogant way the US State Department's spokesman, Adam Ereli, commented on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Russia in 2004. He said, 'We do not believe that the Kyoto Protocol is something that is realistic for the United States and we have no intention of signing or ratifying it'.
It is about time we stood up to the US and told it straight that if it does not sign and ratify the Kyoto Protocol forthwith, our transatlantic relations will suffer a very heavy blow indeed.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I should like to express my appreciation for the opportunity to respond to some of the questions raised in this debate and to express my thanks for all the positive contributions.
If Nairobi is a success, it will mean that we have made the right decisions and the right agreements.
The Commission recognises the need for the European Union to maintain its leading role in not only international but also domestic efforts to fight climate change.
I agree that it is important to assist developing countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and to help them in deploying sustainable technologies.
A few days ago, the Commission proposed the new Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund.
The anticipated total initial funding from public and commercial sources is EUR 100 million.
This new initiative aims to boost climate-friendly technologies in Africa in particular.
In addition, we have the Adaptation Fund.
We hope it will be agreed in Nairobi to make this operational.
The fund will be financed by 2% on the proceeds of the clean development mechanism.
We expect about EUR 350 million to be available for investments in developing countries and in Africa for the period 2008 to 2012.
The European Union can only be credible in its leadership role when it achieves meaningful reductions in domestic emissions and complies with international commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.
The second national allocation plans of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme will be a decisive test.
If Member States put more allowances into the European market than companies are likely to emit collectively, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme would fail.
Mr Davies said that collectively the first 17 plans notified propose a total allocation that exceeds 2005 emissions of these Member States by about 15%, which is really a lot.
I am determined that we shall not permit the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme to fail and the Commission will assess all the National Allocation Plans in a consistent and fair manner.
All the Member States will have to contribute to the success of the Emissions Trading Scheme in the period 2008 to 2012.
I agree that we should try very hard with our public relations and the possibilities for influencing our governments, but also your involvement and action is important in this crucial phase of the Emissions Trading Scheme.
I would ask you that together we ensure that, in all the capitals of the Member States and in Brussels, this debate on the allocation is about how much more we should reduce, rather than how much more we can emit.
In the next few days, a communication on the Emissions Trading Scheme should be adopted by the Commission, launching a review of this important scheme.
This will address its scope, how to make it simpler and more predictable, strengthening compliance and linking up with Emissions Trading Schemes elsewhere.
As regards tackling transport emissions, which contribute to about 22% of the emissions in the European Union, this year the Commission will put forward a legislative proposal to include the aviation sector in European Union emissions trading.
Also this year, the Commission will review the possibilities for further reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from cars after 2008-2009, with a view to meeting the Community target of 120g of carbon dioxide per kilometre by 2012.
That will, of course, require legislation.
The Commission is also exploring options for a legal framework in the European Union to allow the safe capture and underground storage of carbon dioxide from industrial installations, provided that that is considered appropriate.
The Commission also intends to promote adaptation measures, helping the regional and national decision-makers to deal with increasingly evident impacts of climate change.
On the basis of a Green Paper on adaptation to climate change, to be launched at a conference in Brussels on 1 December, the Commission will begin a public debate on the need to adapt to unavoidable climate change.
Most importantly, we will have to further frame the international debate after 2012.
Next January, the Commission is planning to release its energy package. A core part of the package will be the strategic European Union energy review.
This will put forward an alternative energy scenario for the European Union that is in line with the European Union's long-term climate change objective.
Close to the adaptation of the energy package, the Commission will also be releasing a Green Paper on the European Union's views on further action to tackle climate change.
This Green Paper will respond to the European Council's request to develop a European Union strategy to limit global warming to 2Â°C, compared to pre-industrial levels.
It will identify concrete proposals, both within the European Union and internationally, for achieving that objective.
One of our main objectives will be to bring on board the United States and other fast-developing countries like China and India in a common but differentiated way, as provided for by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change.
The Commission will ensure that the energy package and the Green Paper put forward a climate and energy strategy for the European Union that is coherent, coordinated and sustainable.
I believe that since last year in Montreal there is a certain new momentum in the international debate on climate change.
While we need to keep up the pace in domestic efforts, in the international process we will have to remain patient and continue to build trust.
Finally, I would like to say that Al Gore has really helped a lot in raising awareness in the European Union and I had the honour to introduce him to a packed theatre in Brussels about a month ago.
I have received one motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Inland waterway transport (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the promotion of inland waterway transport: NAIADES, an integrated European Action Programme for inland waterway transport.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to convey my heartfelt thanks to the Vice-President of the Commission for 'NAIADES', the Action Programme for inland waterway transport.
Parliament is your ally, because inland waterway transport must be given a prominent place on the European agenda.
Our report has received unanimous support from the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I should like to extend warm thanks to my fellow MEPs, the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the staff for their efforts.
Mr Vice-President, although Parliament backs your goals, we do think that more ambition is called for if they are to be capable of being achieved.
In the report, Parliament underlines, above all, the importance of reliable inland waterways.
This is, after all, the key to their success and to their expansion.
Reliable inland waterway transport hinges on sound infrastructure and transhipment facilities, and the current maintenance backlog of the inland waterways infrastructure in Europe is one of the most urgent problems to be resolved.
In this respect, the new Member States, with their specific problems, must receive special attention.
Prime responsibility lies, of course, with national or regional authorities, which give too little priority in this area.
This House also wants to see more funding within the framework of the TENs, especially where priority projects are concerned, and we are still waiting for the appointment of a TEN coordinator.
Could you promise that you will come up with a proposal shortly?
Parliament would also like greater priority and a higher preferential rate of 20% for all inland waterway projects of common interest, which will make it possible to back many small infrastructure projects, for the bulk of the funds have, so far, in fact been diverted to rail and road, which has to change if we take the NAIADES Programme seriously.
River information services projects must also be considered for a contribution from the multi-annual programme.
This is something Parliament will be voting in favour of tomorrow, and is also what the Finnish Presidency has proposed in the Council.
If you can give it your backing therefore, things are bound to fall into place.
Parliament is also ambitious where the environment is concerned.
We hope that the Commission will present regulations for cleaner fuel as quickly as possible.
Last Friday, we received additional information from your offices, for which we are indebted.
Clearly, much research has been done, also into the technical and economic impact.
The results appear promising, and that is why I should like to ask you to table a sound proposal when the directive is reviewed.
It is important not to lose track of the prospect that IWT will be just as clean as road transport. This is also something the sector itself is in favour of.
I have read in the paper that the sector believes it could achieve more via the Central Consultancy Register, since the Commission is said not to want to rush things.
I hope you will be able to put my mind at rest about this.
Much has been said about the innovation fund, which, in my view, is a wonderful instrument to flesh out this fine Action Programme.
The sector has good ideas of its own, and EUR 40 million have been set aside in Brussels.
This House is of the opinion that the Commission and Council should also show commitment and should match the same amount, so that EUR 120 million would become available.
The Council has produced little in the way of concrete commitment, but would you be in a position to convince them?
Even more importantly, would you be prepared to make these EUR 40 million available over the next few years?
I consider this to be a test case to demonstrate whether you really want to implement the Action Programme.
The Action Programme contains various other points we are very happy to endorse: a funding manual, guidelines for state support and the announced screening of existing legislation, which is desperately needed in order to trim down the administrative burden.
I should, in this connection, like to draw your attention to problematic environmental legislation.
It is not for no reason that I have left the institutional issue to last, something for which I have set out a clear course in my report.
We must focus on cooperation, take into consideration the current competences of all participating parties and capitalise on the expertise of international organisations.
A battle over powers will only have a delaying effect.
We must start implementing the Action Programme as a matter of urgency.
Finally, the Commission will also need to show a real commitment to action.
By rolling up their sleeves, the Commission will prove that it is really taking inland waterways to heart and only then will the time be right to consider, if necessary - and I am not convinced of this yet - the institutional relations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Wortmann-Kool on this excellent report.
The Resolution shows that there is broad agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the promotion of inland waterway transport.
Inland waterway transport is safe, low-polluting and energy efficient, and offers great reserve capacities.
Despite the advantages it offers, inland waterway transport is under-used: it represents scarcely 6% of the total overland goods transport in the Union, even though, in a few Member States, its modal share stands at 40%.
Today, Europe has 36 000 km of inland waterways.
We are talking here about a genuine trans-European network.
We need a European approach in order to promote this mode of transport.
It can achieve a far greater modal share if, as you just pointed out, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, our approach is accompanied by concrete action.
I am grateful to Parliament for the support that it has given me via this report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool.
I am going to confine myself, Mr President, to a few remarks about the main points, starting with the improvement of market conditions.
We must develop new multi-modal, innovative services, so as to enable inland waterway transport to play its role among the large seaports and the big cities in the Hinterland.
More than 70% of the inland navigation sector is made up of small businesses, often owner-boatmen.
We need to create conditions that will help strengthen their position in the market: for example, improved access to funds through the removal of any regulatory and administrative barriers and clear indications as to what State aid is available.
The Commission is going to start work on State aid for this sector.
These guidelines will be published in 2008-2009.
That is all I have to say on market conditions.
As regards the modernisation of the fleet, inland waterway transport must improve its logistical efficiency and its performance in relation to the environment and safety.
Innovations must be focused on the construction of boats - for example, the engine and the propulsion system - and on information and communication technologies for what are known as river information services.
A regulatory framework already exists, but we must ensure that the system is actually implemented.
That also applies to the standards applicable to fuel intended for inland navigation.
Stricter standards, which we should propose by the end of the year, will enable us to further improve the environmental quality of inland waterway transport.
I now come to the promotion of employment and skills.
Inland waterway transport suffers from a dearth of crews and a worsening shortage of candidates to take over businesses.
The strategy must be focused on an improvement to onboard working and living conditions and on professional training.
I plan to propose harmonising the requirements relating to crew members and to boatmasters' certificates in 2008 via the mutual recognition procedure.
With regard to the image of waterway transport, we must correct the one that inland navigation currently suffers from.
We must make people aware of the real potential of inland navigation by implementing a network to promote inland waterway transport, as exists in certain regions.
With regard to waterway infrastructure, there are, within the network, bottlenecks that curb the competitiveness of inland waterway transport.
We must therefore remove the existing obstacles.
That is primarily a responsibility of the Member States, but the Community can help thanks to the trans-European networks.
In this context, the Commission prioritises the development of the two major waterway routes: the Rhine-Meuse-Danube route and the Seine-Scheldt link.
In the new financial regulation submitted for Parliament's approval, we have proposed a 30% rate of support for the waterway projects and the inclusion of these projects in the multi-annual programme.
I hope that the Council, like Parliament, will support our proposals.
The contribution of intelligent transport systems is vital.
We are preparing to implement river information services, by which, in practical terms, we mean a system for managing information concerning inland waterway transport, which will enable boatmen to plan their journeys better, to reduce the time they wait at locks and to constantly monitor transport.
Mrs Wortmann-Kool, you mentioned the appointment of a TEN coordinator.
I must say that we welcomed the positive results obtained by the six coordinators who have already been appointed.
Mr Costa, for his part, has also called for the appointment of a coordinator for both inland waterway transport and maritime transport.
I can tell you that my intention is indeed to select two coordinators over the next few weeks.
The NAIADES programme provides for a range of very different actions: harmonised legislation, strategic promotion and coordination measures.
All of these actions will only be effective, however, if the institutional framework is suitable.
The fact is that, today, we are faced with fragmented resources and efforts spread over different levels.
We therefore need to adapt the framework to the demands of an enlarged European market.
We are in the process of analysing different options.
The results of this analysis will be discussed with all of the parties concerned, with the Member States and with the international river commissions.
To conclude, we need this NAIADES programme to be a success and, to that end, we need to be able to rely on the support of decision-makers at every level: national and regional authorities, river commissions and businesses.
I am grateful to Parliament and to you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for sending out, with this report, a strong signal in favour of the promotion of inland navigation, which Europe needs now more than ever.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Vice-President Barrot has sketched a wide-ranging programme concerning inland waterway transport, on which we can only congratulate him.
Speaking from the perspective of Parliament, we consider this parliamentary report, prepared by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, to be a worthy statement and report on this wide-ranging programme.
On this matter our intentions perfectly match those of the Commission.
From among the various strategic ramifications, I would like to underline a single issue, that of infrastructure.
Recent floods have demonstrated that in terms of infrastructure, and within that, specifically with regard to trying to improve navigability, we have to proceed cautiously in order to guarantee navigation on a permanent basis.
Floods render navigation unreliable and unpredictable; therefore, the most important goal of the NAIADES programme is paying close attention to flood control.
I would like to stress the programme's environmental considerations - which require special emphasis - such as the creation and conservation of floodplains.
I believe that we have to act with care and in harmony with respect to environmental and navigational requirements.
Just a brief comment on another point.
For the navigability of the Danube, it is important to be able to count on high quality shipping conditions along its entire length.
Among the third countries concerned, I would like to highlight Serbia.
For Serbia, the value of the Danube as a waterway has increased considerably, and therefore, I suggest close cooperation on this matter among the future Member States of Romania and Bulgaria as well as the Black Sea region.
All these proposals are put forward in the report, for which I express my thanks to my fellow Member, Mrs Wortmann-Kool.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, a moment ago I was saying to the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that, so far tonight, all of the speakers in this debate have been women.
Then they will say that transport is only of interest to men.
Perhaps NAIADES inspires us, and perhaps the Commissioner should take note and appoint two women coordinators for NAIADES.
Let us return to serious issues though, and the report by Mrs Wortmann-Kool.
In principle, we formally support the Integrated European Action Programme for Inland Waterways, known as 'NAIADES', and the idea of giving it a greater political profile.
It is true, and we have noted this, that the use of inland waterways varies a lot throughout Europe, from 0.1%, in countries like the United Kingdom, Italy, and even a little less in my country, to 40% in the Netherlands, which has a greater number of these waterways.
Unfortunately, in some cases canals and rivers have been abandoned.
Admirable attempts at recovery are being made, however.
In my country, due to its mountainous nature, canals and rivers are used more for carrying irrigation and drinking water than for transport, but we nevertheless are aware of and support the initiatives relating to the navigable stretch of the Guadalquivir from Seville to the sea, which is also hoping to be included in the trans-European network.
Furthermore, I am also delighted by the current efforts of my city, Zaragoza, which will host Expo 2008 and which, within that context, wishes - and this has been proposed within the context of the objective of promoting water and sustainable development - to restore the navigability of the River Ebro.
We are therefore pleased to be able to include ourselves in this European project.
We are talking about sustainable development when we refer to inland waterways' potential to help reduce the impact of CO2 emissions by up to 75% compared to roads and also - and this is why it is so important - to promote this inland waterways network at European level and to support new formulae so that this sector can be more competitive and efficient.
Mrs Wortmann-Kool has done an excellent job as rapporteur, and we are eagerly awaiting the Commission's coming proposals to enhance the economic and competitive impact of this new sector.
We particularly support the strengthening of infrastructures. That is to say, for thousands of kilometres of inland waterways and hundreds of inland ports, with lock infrastructures, etc., which have already been named, to finally become a connection network that strengthens regional and territorial cohesion.
To this end, some of the amendments that we presented in committee and which have been included propose greater inclusion of this sector in the trans-European network programmes.
We have also proposed supporting river information services, which we believe will very much increase the efficiency and safety of the sector.
Furthermore, we believe that it is an excellent idea to obtain greater economic support for the sector's potential for container traffic, although there are still great deficiencies here.
In the report on logistics, which I hope to be able to present to this House, I will clearly also include Mrs Wortmann-Kool's proposals on improving logistical aspects and innovation and technological progress for reducing operational costs.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has emphasised - and I am obliged to him for doing so - 6% of all goods and persons transported are carried on waterways, and so an ambitious programme is required if these unused capacities are to be put to work and the existing infrastructure improved.
It has to be said that the greatest deficiency in this area is the lack of intermodal nodes; if transport links - including these means of transport - are to be developed, the first thing to be done is to establish ports and terminals.
In other transport sectors, innovation has made great strides; here, though, it is limping along behind.
There is still a lot of lost ground to be made up where fuels and materials are concerned, and this programme should provide an opportunity for that to be done, but we must also - as my colleague has already mentioned - give very serious attention to the environment, and I attach particular importance to this.
I would also ask you to support an amendment that we have tabled, which has to do with the transport of hazardous goods on waterways, which must be subject to regulations every bit as stringent as those applicable to road and rail, for an accident with hazardous goods on a waterway can do enormous and irreparable damage.
Another issue is the threat of flagging-out - the re-registration of vessels under flags of convenience - which poses a risk to social standards, among other things, and that is a danger we absolutely must take into account from the very outset.
I want to thank the rapporteur for her superb report and the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation.
Thank you all very much, and I hope that it will, tomorrow, be adopted as it now stands.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, for years, old canals were neglected or closed, inland waterway transport appeared to be a thing of the past and there was a massive growth in the transport of goods by road.
Nowadays, everyone across the party-political boundaries welcomes the fact that the water-borne transport of goods is coming back into fashion.
This consensus conceals different opinions, as was evident in this House during the debate in February 2003 on the subject of the White Paper on transport 2010.
To my group, as to some others, water-borne transport is an alternative to ever more and widening motorways.
It is a way of being economical with space and the environment.
This is in contrast to another view, which wants more of everything, including, therefore, even more motorways.
By creating overcapacity, entrepreneurs are given more freedom to make fresh choices within this overcapacity to decide which mode of transport is most advantageous to them at that particular moment in time.
An example of overcapacity is the expensive Betuwe line that has been built as a TEN project for transport of freight by rail in the Netherlands alongside the rivers Waal and Lek, that are perfectly navigable, at the lower reaches of the Rhine.
More pressing projects than these projects that are probably underutilised include the widening of the narrow canals that connect Northern France with Belgium and the Netherlands, or returning the ever dwindling transport across the Danube between Hungary and the Black Sea ever since the bombardments of 1999 back to its original level.
My group is opposed to overcapacity.
Even in the case of waterways, this is at the expense of space, nature and the environment.
The adjustment of rivers impacts on flood plains, biodiversity, the supply of drinking water and flooding surrounding low lands.
In addition, water-borne transport is not a panacea that magics away all the risks of polluting and harmful substances.
Their transport entails risks not only for the rivers themselves, but also for the residential areas and areas of outstanding beauty that are located downstream.
We need more than just cleaner engines and sulphur-free fuel.
Together with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we would propose infrastructural levies in order to promote fair competition between different modes of transport, a better environmental impact assessment of European development plans, a tightening of legislation for the transport of dangerous substances and preventing inland waterway ships from being put under flags of convenience, because this adversely affects social, security and environmental standards.
Only when our water-borne transport meets quality requirements of this kind, is its growth a step in the right direction.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her extremely comprehensive report and thank her for the good cooperation.
Like the other speakers, I should like to express wholehearted support for the NAIADES Programme.
Inland waterway transport can, provided it is correctly backed by flanking policy, substantially contribute towards solving the problem of transport.
I am pleased that this message is also being sent to the national, regional and local governments.
Both old and new Member States are urged, in their economic and planning policy, to give due consideration to the scope that inland waterways offer in order to meet the transport needs of enterprises, not only for bulkier, but also for slimmer, flows of goods.
In addition, the recommendation for active improvements in the fleet's environmental performance also receives my unqualified support.
As in road transport, incentive schemes for the introduction of the reduction of emission and energy-saving measures in inland waterway transport also help make the fleet more environmentally-friendly.
Finally, I hope that the Member States will approach this Action Programme with the same positive attitude and commitment as the Members of this House have done in the recent weeks.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to draw particular attention to the title of Mrs Wortmann-Kool's report.
It is a report on the promotion of inland waterway transport.
Inland waterway transport most certainly needs aid.
This might not be the case in the Netherlands, where the report's author hails from, but it is certainly true of many other European Union countries, including Poland, my home country.
The Oder Programme was adopted a few years ago in Poland, and was initially called the Oder 2006 Programme, but was later extended to last until 2015.
However, all these schemes amount to empty words, because nothing is actually being done.
The virtue of the report we are currently debating is that it sets out to deal with European inland waterways as an autonomous field, and here I emphasise the word 'autonomous' which means not treating inland waterways as a complement to road and rail transport, as an unimportant addition to them.
Instead, inland waterways are perceived as an independent, autonomous whole.
This is very significant, because the forthcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania will provide a unique opportunity to create a European network of inland waterways.
I would like to tell the House about one of my dreams.
It is a dream I think many members of my committee share, and it involves a journey along the old and new inland waterways in Europe.
It may be an old-fashioned journey, but it is a very beautiful one.
In order to be able to undertake it, however, further significant investment is needed.
I think it is worthwhile recalling a couple of significant ideas that have formed part of the aspirations of far-sighted politicians over the centuries.
One of these is the plan for a canal between the Oder and the Danube, which would create a link between two important bodies of water.
I urge the European Commission not to end the studies, but to continue working on a European network of inland waterways.
Studies in this field should be continued, and I wish the venture every success.
(DE) Mr President, as is well known, Austria is a land of mountains, but it is also - and Austria's national day being tomorrow, perhaps I might be permitted this allusion - described in its own national anthem as a land on a river, the river in question being the Danube.
This makes inland waterways an important subject for us Austrians, as we are connected by water to the West, to the Rhine-Main-Meuse system that is to be found there, but also, and above all, to the south and east.
We in Austria know how important it is - not only for our own country, but also for Europe as a whole - to have a better, by which I mean above all better-functioning system of waterways.
Although reference has been made to the environment and technological dimensions, and to much else besides, we also know that it is above all for the sake of the new and future Member States of the EU that alternatives to roads are needed, for without them, we really are going to end up as roadkill, and what better alternative could there be than a well-developed and therefore well-used infrastructure in Corridor 7 of the Trans-European Network?
I am glad that the Commission is willing to attach greater importance to this mode of transport, and I can do no other than agree with much of what Vice-President Barrot has said today.
While, though, we do need plans and programmes to be set out, they also need to be implemented, and as soon as possible.
I hope that the contributions made at the Vienna conference on inland waterways staged by the Austrian Presidency of the Council were useful in terms of our subject overall and will therefore be relevant to our future opportunities.
I particularly want to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool for the very good work she has done on this document and for her good cooperation, and, in particular, for her willingness to be talked into contending not only for the priorities of 'old Europe' but also for the openings and opportunities afforded by the new.
Let me repeat what I said earlier: now is the time for us to make use of these opportunities!
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the neglect of internal waterways in the EU has been going on for many years to a positively criminal degree.
NAIADES is a means whereby we want to change that.
We want internal waterways to make headway in terms of job creation, on the markets, in terms of infrastructure and the fleet as a whole.
These depend, above all else, on the reliability of internal waterways and on the availability of multi-functional inland ports, not least with regard to multimodal transport links, and I would, in this regard, like to do as Commissioner Barrot has already done and highlight the importance of RIS as an important contribution to the use of inland waterways, and would argue that its potential ought to be used to the full by its being incorporated into the TEN programme.
Back to NAIADES, though.
The report on the subject highlights the need for tighter emission limit values to be laid down across the Community, particularly by promoting the use of low-sulphur fuels.
So far, so good, but I see it as counterproductive if more stringent emission limit values were to oblige the internal waterways sector, most of the operators in which are, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises, to pay out a great deal of money that they cannot afford for refits, and so we have to work towards incentives, provided not only by the Commission but also by the Member States, for a more rapid introduction of environmentally-friendly engines on ships.
It strikes me as important that the planned European Waterway Transport Innovation Fund be established subject to conditions agreed on with the inland waterways businesses themselves, and that the Fund should be able to help with the funding of communications offices.
Further to the Commission's initiative for the production of information source on financial issues, in the shape, for example, of a funding handbook, what is also needed is a European development plan containing an up-to-date inventory and more detailed information on European waterways, which must draw on existing expert studies and reports, as well as on the experiences gained by the coordinators.
It would, after all, be wrong to keep on reinventing the wheel, and, since, additional bureaucracy is undesirable in the implementation of the action plans, we have to take particular care that it is avoided.
I will conclude by thanking our rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for her dedication and for her cooperation, which really has been good and constructive.
Mr President, I should like to begin by echoing what was said in this excellent debate and by thanking all of the speakers.
Inland navigation is not, as you said, an added extra.
It is a genuine option, and we need modes of transport other than roads in today's Europe.
I am therefore fully determined, just as determined as your rapporteur and yourselves.
Nevertheless, you are right: we cannot just make declarations; we need to act.
I am therefore going to provide you with a few answers.
Let us begin by focusing on the innovation fund: the Commission services, together with representatives of the profession and the Member States, are currently looking into the possibility of creating a fund for innovation in the field of inland waterway transport.
This fund would be an important instrument for implementing the NAIADES programme.
We are examining different options, such as how this fund can be sustained by the inland navigation sector, the Union and the Member States.
The Commission will draft a report on the state of play and on the results of the assessments in 2007.
You did in fact place great emphasis on this innovation fund, Mrs Wortmann-Kool.
On the issue of pollution from ships, it is true, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that we must think about reducing the level of sulphur in the fuel used for inland navigation purposes, but we must not go too far.
The idea is to bring this level of sulphur down to the level of the diesel fuel used in road transport.
This reduction in the sulphur level is key to reducing air pollution.
We are carrying out a review of the directives on air pollution with the aim of substantially reducing this sulphur level.
However, I have taken full note of what you said about the investments required to that end.
Mrs Lichtenberger, you asked me about the monitoring of dangerous transport.
On this point, I should like to make it clear to you that a proposal is currently the subject of an interservice consultation and is due to be adopted before the end of the year.
As a general rule, the improvement of infrastructure, Mr Meijer, will be accompanied by impact studies, in order to reduce as far as possible any harmful effects of infrastructure works.
Generally speaking, I would say to all of the speakers that infrastructure obviously requires investment.
This investment is the responsibility of the Member States.
Nevertheless, it is true - and I am addressing you, in particular, Mrs Ayala - that we have proposed in the financial regulation to prioritise inland waterway transport by providing for a 30% cap.
May I call for Parliament's help, Mr President, in adopting this financial regulation?
I am well aware that there is some reluctance on the part of the Member States, but I am sure that Parliament will give priority to the inland waterways.
There are undoubtedly other solutions to propose, but my aim with these few answers was to tell you that my intention was obviously to act.
As you pointed out, we, in Europe, have several magnificent waterways, such as the Danube, and I have taken note of your comments about the need to involve all those who live along the Danube.
I must say that we are aware, Mr Rack, of the importance of these waterways and of the major role that they can play in the future.
That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to say to you, in the hope that we can carry out this crucial work together and accord Europe's waterways the full importance they deserve.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Public-private partnerships (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Weiler, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on public-private partnerships and Community law on public procurement and concessions.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the representatives of the other groups - Mrs CederschiÃ¶ld, Mr Lambsdorff, Mrs RÃŒhle - and also to the representatives of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had a hand in the production of this report, for we were able to exchange views in a constructive and fair way, and managed, in any case, to achieve agreement on over 140 amendments in committee, so that there remain only 23 to be considered today or tomorrow, although it has to be said that compromises had to be reached in respect of them too.
We have tried to strike a balance between two powerful opposing parties - the business associations and the local government associations - which put forward their no doubt legitimate interests in a forceful manner.
What I have to say at the beginning of my speech I wish to address to them.
What I want to say to the businessmen is that, despite all that we have heard, I want to make it clear that we in this House take it as self-evident that local authorities should engage in economic activity, and, indeed, that returning certain activities to them is reasonable and legitimate.
What I would like to say to the local authorities is that invitations to tender, whether at the national or European level, do not absolutely have to be arbitrary, but offer the transparency that is needed to benefit the public and prevent corruption.
I get the impression from the debate that their respective associations did not always see it that way.
I have attempted, by means of my report, to strike a balance that would secure more guaranteed competition for the private sector and would give the public sector, in the shape of the local authorities, more scope for inter-municipal cooperation.
Tomorrow, then, we will be deciding where this House stands as regards future mandates for action by the Commission, which - or so my group believes - should, wherever possible, be in the form of legislation.
What this is about is the legal and political aspects of the way in which our municipalities organise services of general public interest.
That they do, of course, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which we here in this House also take very seriously; after all, many Members of this House have strong links with local authorities, having been active in municipal politics before they came here.
We are also, though, asked how we, as the convinced Europeans that we are, would shape the internal market, and there is a plethora of rulings from the European Court of Justice and from other courts at the national level.
Complaints and Commission proceedings make municipalities and investors nervous about making investments at home and initiating projects, and so it is necessary for the European Union to take action.
What, for example, is the substance of European procurement law?
What clarifications or additions need to be made to the institutionalised PPPs and in-house transactions?
We see ourselves as having the vitally important function of considering how to proceed.
My group takes the view that legislation is needed, that it is not enough for the Commission, attempting as it does so to bypass this House, to act by handing down interpretive communications or other instruments of that kind.
I therefore once more appeal today to the Members of this House, when they vote by roll-call tomorrow, to cast a vote for this House's right to govern its own affairs.
We want neither a great laborious enterprise, nor an opening-up of the last procurement directive, which was not transposed in all the Member States - it was not, for example, in Germany - but what we want to see is clarifications and additions, and they must not be made without reference to Parliament.
I will be quite frank in saying that we have no solution to the problem of inter-communal cooperation, which was - as you will see from the amendments - the most controversial area.
The line we take is that it cannot, as a general rule, be excluded from the scope of procurement law, but nor should it be subject to general tender.
What that means is that we need an intelligent solution to this bone of contention, for intercommunal cooperation makes sense for the communities from which we come, and will certainly be useful to them in the future.
That this House is supportive of this instrument is shown not least by our willingness to use money from the Structural Funds for it; I am sure that it is not common knowledge just how much effort we have put into getting that.
Given our sympathy for European local authorities and the expertise of my fellow-Members on the Committees for the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am convinced that we will end up with a law that everyone can support and accept, and one that will be proof against rulings from the European Court of Justice.
Mr President, Mrs Weiler, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been put in place in several areas of the public sector and these partnerships are gradually developing within the European Union.
At a time when public budgets are limited, there can be no doubt as to their importance for the European economy.
This is particularly true in the area of infrastructure, and especially in that of transport infrastructure, with which I am very familiar.
In order to guarantee that these partnerships are totally effective and that public money is spent better, it is important to choose private partners on the basis of fair competition.
Thus, the choice of private partner must be the result of a competitive and non-discriminatory procedure and must enable the partners to get all of the added value out of such a partnership in the long term.
However, many interested parties believe that the regulatory framework that governs which private partners are selected to create these partnerships at Community level is incomplete or unclear.
Mrs Weiler's report presents a balanced assessment of the main challenges that we must take up.
You have provided some good answers to the problems presented, Mrs Weiler, and I should like to thank you for your work as rapporteur.
Allow me to mention what are, in our opinion, two crucial aspects, which I should like to cover before tomorrow's vote.
I shall begin by talking about concessions and then about mixed public-private companies, which are referred to as 'institutionalised PPPs'.
Firstly, concessions: a concession gives a company the right to use facilities that have been built or services that have been provided in return for building infrastructure or providing a service.
The construction and maintenance of roads and airports and waste management are two such examples.
In November 2005 - a year ago - the Commission outlined in its communication the reasons why it thinks it useful to legislate on concessions, particularly on service concessions.
The aim of this initiative is to guarantee equal treatment and legal certainty in relation to the granting of service concessions - as is the case for public contracts - while making a clear distinction between public contracts and concessions.
In this regard, I am sure that Parliament will confirm the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
It remains very clear, however, that the choice of the legislative path should not deprive the public authorities of the room for manoeuvre that they need in order to choose the best private partner and, if necessary, to adjust the concession over time, in line with the objectives targeted by the partnership for the long-term future of the PPP.
Having said that, a step by step approach is called for.
To begin with, the Commission will look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions and will examine other measures that will enable us to deal with the problems at stake.
On the basis of the results of this impact study, the Commission will then - most probably next year - decide whether the cost-benefit ratio warrants such a legislative initiative.
If it does, then we will prepare a legislative proposal.
That is what I wanted to say about concessions.
We now come to mixed capital companies, namely institutionalised PPPs.
Public bodies are increasingly choosing private partners for public service companies set up in conjunction with the public sector.
This is what we call institutionalised public-private partnerships.
This type of partnership raises some specific questions: should the Community non-discrimination principles be applied to the choice of private partner, as the service provider's fellow shareholder, to the choice of service provider, or indeed to both these levels?
This question has given rise to some lively debates in Parliament.
