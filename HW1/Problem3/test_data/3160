I think this is an extremely dangerous demonstration, given that France is a country in which the fight against religious cults has had some very significant successes. Europe still needs to be inspired by such successes, informed as they are by the values of secularism and tolerance, by which I mean true tolerance and not that practised by religious cults.
Thank you for that information and clarification.
Since the matter has been raised in the public arena, could I place on record the reason for the Quaestors' recommendation?
We believe that the term "constituency weeks" was an unfortunate one.
They are weeks without meetings but they are weeks when the Commission, the Council and all other agents of this Parliament, including the political groups, are hard at work.
If we are going to Nice to ask for more powers for this Parliament it is hardly a good precedent for us to send the whole Parliament off for four weeks, away from the place where they are elected to do their duty.
Consequently, we believe that those Members - and there are many of them - who are writing reports, chairing committees, running groups and have legitimate reasons to be here should, on declaration of those objectives, be able to come and do their work in the place that they were elected to do it.
I do not think this is the time and place to enter into a debate on this issue.
As I said in my reply to Mrs Morgan, as soon as I have officially received the recommendation by the Quaestors, the Bureau will examine it most carefully, together with all its implications.
Madam President, in a moment, we will be listening to a communication from the Commission on the fuel crisis, and I am pleased that the Commissioner is able to attend.
We all know that she will not be staying for very long as she is leaving for Luxembourg later on this evening to visit the Transport Council.
This should not prevent us, however, from entering into an extensive and searching debate on this issue and going over the short hour that was originally scheduled.
Madam President, I express the view of many MEPs when I say that I regret that we have to deal with this issue in such a short space of time.
The issue concerned has thrown the whole of Europe into commotion and may well do so for the foreseeable future.
The time allocated is really far too short and, on behalf of many MEPs, I felt I had to express my dissatisfaction in public.
Of course. It is a source of regret to me, too.
Madam President, I would just like to return to the problems associated with the constituency weeks.
What I find very strange is not so much the payments, but the fact that a constituency week has been scheduled just before spring half-term in certain Member States or just before carnival week in a number of other Member States when people are off work on the Monday and Tuesday.
In opting for a constituency week at this stage, you ought to have made it coincide with carnival week instead of the week prior to it.
I would ask the Bureau to reconsider this.
Madam President, a fellow honourable Member has just drawn attention to an anti-Semitic incident.
The issue of racism was heavily debated in Germany over the summer, and I would now like to tell you about several extremely disturbing incidents that have taken place there since the last part-session, in order to raise awareness of what is going on.
Three cases in point: on 2 September, a fifty-year-old waiter of Chinese origin was beaten up and called a 'foreign pig' .
On 13 September, a homeless person was found dead.
Two skinheads have admitted to beating him up.
He had subsequently died from their kicks and punches.
Thirdly, on 4 September, right-wing extremists beat up a person whose parents are of Tunisian origin.
This happened in Kassel.
I would ask that since we mourn other deaths here, could we not do the same for those whom we never knew, and especially those who were murdered for political, specifically racist, reasons?
I would like to raise awareness about this issue in this House, particularly as we had a debate about it in Germany.
Thank you.
These incidents are wholly to be regretted and condemned, and they cannot but encourage us to be extremely vigilant.
Order of business
Mr President, you have just said that we will be starting at half past eleven tomorrow.
That is a most unpleasant surprise because many of us have flights which we can only just make with the earlier voting time, the standard voting time here in the House.
It is a huge problem, it is immensely difficult to find seats on other flights in the evening or even on the following day.
I should therefore like to request that we either keep to a standard voting time or, if not, that we be given more notice.
I should like to request that we keep to a standard voting time, i.e. eleven o' clock.
An alternative proposition is that we start half an hour earlier at 8.30 and then have the voting time at 11 o' clock.
Yes, exactly.
There is no need to vote perhaps, if everyone agrees with this proposal to begin tomorrow at 8.30 a.m. and hold the votes at 11 a.m.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Madam President, you asked if any Members wished to make any comments on the agenda.
I did in fact want to take this opportunity to tell you that I had no objection to Parliament discussing the racist crimes and offences committed against foreigners by people of European origin.
If I am to believe the relevant committee in my own country, they amount to approximately thirty per year out of a total of almost four million crimes and offences, including a million committed by foreigners against native Europeans.
I suggest that the two issues be examined concurrently.
I think it is really a question of equity.
Since racism is unfortunately a universal phenomenon, racist crimes and offences committed by foreigners against Europeans ought also to be investigated.
Yes, I think that would be best.
Madam President, not only do I think it is important we keep tomorrow' s debate on the fight against racism in the form proposed, but in addition, many of our fellow MEPs are now well aware of the fact that no country in Europe is immune from the increase in the xenophobic and populist vote.
In the course of tomorrow' s debate, I should like us, on the basis of what many of our fellow MEPs have said today, to be able to agree upon at least one amendment, namely that, within the confines of this Parliament, no MEP may make racist remarks.
If we succeed in ensuring that, at least in this Parliament, no one can stoop to making racist remarks, then our words and our actions will carry much more weight outside Parliament.
I think that is the best way to respond to Mr Gollnisch.
Measures to be taken following the fuel crisis and the rise in oil prices
The next item is the Commission statement on the measures to be taken following the oil crisis and the increase in the price of oil.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the whole House after having spoken yesterday for two hours with the Energy Committee.
Recent times have been marked by the fact that oil prices have been rising for the last 18 months, and the European public is feeling the full effect.
Clearly, the people who will suffer most as a result of this rise will be the least-favoured social groups and also certain specific sectors which are particularly affected.
At the beginning of 1999, the price of a barrel of crude oil stood at around 10 dollars, whereas today it stands at around 33 to 35 dollars.
This is the highest level since the Gulf war, and is a level which most experts believed could only happen in cases of geopolitical crisis.
The reason for this rise is very clear: the restriction on production on the part of the OPEC countries which coincides with a world economic recovery and the resulting increase in demand.
The impact of this rise has been particularly great in the European Union and especially in the euro zone, owing to the euro' s value against the dollar.
We cannot ignore the consequences of this rise on Europe' s economic development.
In specific terms, we estimate that, at the moment, this accounts for 1% of our inflation and a reduction of around 0.3% of our growth. Some specific professional sectors - farming, fishing and transport - are in situations which are at times frankly difficult.
However, both the producing countries and the consumer countries share a common interest, that of stability and the predictability of prices.
We would all benefit from prices being established in a market of free competition and not, as is happening now, in accordance with a monopolistic situation in a market which to be honest is less than transparent.
Furthermore, the European Union' s level of dependency currently stands at around 50%.
However, unless we introduce new measures, we will reach more or less 70% by 2020.
In the specific case of oil, our dependency on external sources stands at between 85% and 90%.
This must clearly lead us to a debate on the increase in our energy dependency on external sources and, therefore, on our vulnerability in this respect.
We must grasp our responsibility and our destiny with both hands.
Although the European Union' s competence in the field of energy is limited, we must not remain passive in the face of such a situation and allow it to get worse, but rather we must find answers.
That is why ensuring a sufficient level of independence and, above all, of availability in the European Union' s energy supplies, must be a priority policy and furthermore a policy on a Community scale.
Little more than a year ago, when I first came into contact with this House as future Commissioner with responsibility for energy, I indicated very clearly that, from the Commission' s point of view, there were two crucial elements which needed to be considered in the coming years.
On the one hand, the need to strategically promote dialogue on energy policy in international fora, and especially with the large producing and consumer countries, and, on the other, the need to adapt our priorities so that we can better focus our changes in the face of adverse energy situations such as the current one.
The Commission intends to fulfil these fundamental objectives and has been working on them for several months.
The Commission has practically finished the preparation of a Green Paper on the security of supply and on the Kyoto commitments, that is to say, the conditions for emissions in the energy sector. This Green Paper will be adopted before the end of the year.
I hope it will serve as a starting point for a broad debate amongst the interested parties to examine the role and place of each of our energy sources over the next twenty or thirty years.
Furthermore, we must promote international dialogue in the short term and step up this dialogue with the producing countries in order to convince them of our common interest in price stability - an issue which they themselves have raised - putting forward the objective of a price band.
At the same time, we have to take account of the geopolitical context in which we are moving, especially of the peace process in the Middle East and the complex political situation in the whole area.
The European Union must send a clear and forceful message to all the OPEC countries and highlight the need for appropriate measures to be taken in order to fulfil what they have indicated to be their objective, that is to say, for oil prices to return to a reasonable band.
We must say that we are the main net importer and the second largest consumer of oil in the world.
The European Union therefore has the means and reasons justifying its voice to be heard but perhaps political means are not sufficient.
As well as this dialogue with OPEC, however, we must not forget that we need to maintain and strengthen our strategic relations with Russia and we should consider the necessary means to modernise production and distribution conditions in that country which is, let us not forget, the third largest producer of oil in the world and, if we take account of gas, their position is absolutely vital.
The European Union must maintain a united front and speak with one voice.
Disparate initiatives by individual Member States will always be incomplete and, what is more, less productive than those on which we stand united.
As for the fiscal aspect, an issue that has been much discussed in recent times, the Commission understands the concerns of the professional sectors most affected by the sudden increase in oil prices.
In this respect we encourage the Member States to enter into and maintain social dialogue with all the interested parties in order to find solutions which are suitable and conform to Community law.
One of the lessons we can learn from the blockades which have paralysed economic activity in various States, is the need to raise the level of coordination between Member States and, of course, with the support of the Commission.
To this end, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few minutes I will leave this meeting to depart for Luxembourg, where a special Council of Transport Ministers is taking place.
For both environmental and economic reasons, Member States must not give in to pressure and change their overall medium-term policy on oil.
A reduction in taxation or subsidies over an extended period would simply amount to a transfer of the fiscal income towards the OPEC countries and would send them an inappropriate message.
However, the very difficult situation we are in at the moment probably requires, in the short term, the adoption of aid measures by the competent public authorities.
In fact, there are already some agreements on the table.
I must point out though that these measures must be purely transitional and in all cases must conform to competition rules and not violate the internal rules of the single market.
We must seek consensus on the approach to fuel taxation and prevent the kind of cacophony which results from the actions and statements of the different States of the Union.
For example, what is the point of talking about ecological taxes on a European scale if we cannot quickly harmonise the rates of the special taxes and VAT within the Union?
Ladies and gentlemen, in this context I must say that a reduction in the special taxes in favour of road transport can only be considered as a very short-term measure, lasting no more than a few months.
In no event can it be extended, since that would run directly counter to the objectives to promote other types of alternative transport, such as the railways, it would go against our Kyoto objectives and would undoubtedly contradict what have been our guiding principles in European Union transport policy until now.
The Commission is extremely concerned about the serious attacks on free movement which have taken place recently on various occasions.
We believe, and I wish to say this once again, that no one social category should be allowed to hold the whole of society to ransom.
I was talking about aid, however, and I wish to say that we must break up and end anti-competitive practices and these practices are clearly taking place in the fuel sector.
Why should there be such a considerable difference in the prices - before tax - of oil derivatives as there is at the moment in the European Union, in some cases just across the border in the next country?
The Commission intends to continue the contacts established with Member States in order to detect any practices which contravene competition rules.
Any agreements between companies or abuses of dominant positions must be severely penalised.
We will also have to examine the question of competition between intermodal sectors in order to find solutions on a European scale.
But we must not fool ourselves, ladies and gentlemen. We are talking about short-term actions which may alleviate the current crisis, but in no way change the undeniable fact that our economy is vulnerable to energy fluctuations.
It is true that the economy is less vulnerable than it was 25 years ago, but at the end of the day it is still vulnerable.
Oil consumption in the European Union stands at 12 million barrels per day and is expected to reach just over 13 million in 2020.
It is probable that the barrel price, in normal economic circumstances, will not in the long term return to below 20 dollars - and, of course, in no event to what it was 18 months ago, that is to say, 10 dollars.
We must tackle this dependency and this situation through two fundamental fields of action: diversifying our sources and saving energy.
The discussion of diversification requires a long-term debate.
The future Green Paper on supply will contribute to it.
I wish to state very clearly that, when talking about diversification of energy sources, sustainable energy has a clear and decisive contribution to make for the future, but at the moment we cannot ignore any type of energy.
The management of demand and energy saving is the other area on which we must focus for the long term.
With regard to oil, we are today 50% more efficient that 25 years ago, but it must be said that the transport sector still has to make a special effort in this area.
More than 90% of the increase in oil consumption in the Union from now until 2020 will be absorbed in principle by the transport sector.
That is why we need a White Paper on transport policy which seeks to readjust modes of transport, to improve the Trans-European Networks, to eliminate points of congestion, to promote the railways, river transport, short haul sea shipping, to promote effective and less polluting urban transport, with the rationalisation of the use of the traditional car and the promotion of innovative research projects into clean fuels, and to improve the awareness and education of drivers.
Measures must also be adopted for construction and savings in this sector, which is one of the fields that consumes most energy, not to mention the promotion of competition in the gas sector and the emergence of gas as a competitor and alternative to oil.
In conclusion, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that we will only overcome the current crisis through coherent strategies which are well coordinated and multi-faceted.
Unfortunately, we do not have access to a panacea to resolve this situation in the short term, but luckily this current crisis has shown us the only way to overcome it: to promote competition in our markets, consolidate our common presence at an international level, coordinate our actions, adapt our priorities to the new energy objectives and act together in the fiscal field.
In the difficult situation we find ourselves in, the citizens expect us to turn these objectives into tangible realities, thinking not only of the immediate future but also of the medium and long term.
Madam President, Commissioner de Palacio, I would like to thank the Members of the Commission for the position they adopted, which showed realism.
We must ask ourselves whether it is necessary to get caught up in a crisis before we start to speak about better strategies.
Nothing would now be easier than calling on all Member States of the Union to substantially decrease taxation on oil products up until the price of a barrel of crude hopefully returns to the 22 - 25 US dollar mark, or thereabouts.
And it would be just as easy now for the Member States and their Ministers of Finance to declare that taxes should not be touched at all.
The reason for this is the difficulty of replacing tax revenue in the short term, and the long-term consumption-curbing effect of taxes whereby we aim to have an impact on the future state of our environment.
However, something has to be done.
People have had enough, and above all the livelihood of people in certain occupations is directly and badly endangered, as the Commissioner said, to mention just the fishermen, farmers and people who drive for a living.
In the longer term, fuel prices will bump up inflation still further and threaten the whole EU area with an economic setback.
The Member States now have to find a common approach in both the short and the long term.
Measures taken separately by individual countries under pressure from the protests will only make the situation more problematic and will distort competition.
The responsibility for action clearly lies with national governments.
Short-term measures will be the hardest.
Naturally it is essential to have intensive negotiations with the OPEC countries to increase oil production, if that is possible in general, thus easing the situation by ensuring steady supplies.
It will be difficult to get a quick result, however.
This means that very precise measures with regard to taxes on diesel and heating oil, for example, within the realms of possibility, will be a good solution, if they are implemented generally.
The reasons for the crisis can be found, not just in problems with supply, but also possibly in the refinery chain structure, the nature of the fuel market, futures market practices, and storage policies in certain countries and areas.
It is claimed that the refinery chain is in the hands of so few that a cartel-like situation has developed in the market.
I myself am not claiming that this is the case, but we need to look into the situation.
One question is this: is the Union in a position to negotiate strategies for vital stocks of oil both within its own territory and with the United States, as, apparently, the decline in US stocks and now their need for replenishment are pushing up the spot price of oil even further.
The Commissioner has already mentioned the dilapidated state of production machinery in Russia, a large oil producer.
Is it not time - the question is obviously mainly directed at Russia, but it is for us to consider also - that we embarked on measures that would persuade people to invest in Russian oil production?
In the long term, as the former Saudi Oil Minister, Sheikh Yamani, suggested, the permanently high price of oil will lead to other forms of energy.
With a glint in his eye, he said that the Stone Age did not end because people ran out of stones.
What is essential now, however, is the ability on the part of the countries of the Union to react in the short term.
Is it actually so that a reduction in the relatively same rate of tax on liquid fuel until the middle of next year by national governments throughout the Union is impossible?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Vice-President of the Commission, on this issue there is a European problem: we do not have a European policy in this area and the Vice-President has recognised this fact.
Furthermore, this is a policy which requires much perseverance as well as investment and resources, because the problem, in relation to energy, is that 'we only remember Santa BÃ¡rbara when it thunders' , that is to say, in normal conditions, as Mrs de Palacio has pointed out, consumption tends to increase, and in a society where the car is king, this means a trend towards greater dependency.
In the medium and long term, I believe that the course of action described by the Commissioner, in line with what the Commission had proposed, should be maintained, monitored and strengthened, taking advantage of the development of sustainable energy, reducing dependency on oil, managing, for example, to break up the compartmentalisation of certain national markets and I am thinking, for instance, of the development of the railways as a complement and an alternative to the development of road transport.
None of this, however, is going to resolve the current situation.
That is to say, we need a virtuous policy, but at the same time we are now facing a particularly complex situation in that there are a series of professions who are in a very difficult position and which, as forms of Community-scale protests are developing in Europe, has lead to blockades and disorder and disparate reactions from our governments.
I would like very briefly to point out that, in recent times, thanks to more rigorous budgetary management, there has been talk of lightening the tax burden.
The people do not therefore understand why this cannot extend to oil products.
We must be able to understand this reaction and, at the same time, we must explain to our citizens the reasons for our decisions.
It is true that compensatory measures are required.
It is very important that we manage to improve the situation of transparency as well as anti-monopoly measures, which are the responsibility of the Commission, because somebody is benefiting: OPEC has increased the price, but does not take more than 5 or 6 dollars per barrel.
Above all, we must try to see to it that our governments react jointly and that, finally, we create a European energy policy that is in keeping with the common economic and social area.
Madam President, Commissioner, you made it quite plain: we remain vulnerable.
Energy is not cheap.
It is a scarce commodity.
We seem to have forgotten that, once upon a time, we paid as little as USD 10 for a barrel of oil.
We did not ask ourselves the questions which we probably should have asked and which we are asking ourselves today.
Commissioner, you also mentioned that we have seen prices rise for the past eighteen months.
I wonder why the European experts and powers that be did not meet sooner to establish, when prices first started to rise, how things would develop, how this could be prevented from continuing and how we could avoid getting to the point where we are today.
Commissioner, you also stated that we should respond as a united front but we now see that every country has caught "the French flu" .
There is a lack of internal coherence, both in the reactions to the protests - protests which I can often understand very well - and in defending the currency, as well as a lack of external coherence in our attitude to OPEC.
We have to admit that a price of USD 10 per barrel of oil is just as abnormal as one of USD 35 and you are well aware that, while a price of USD 10 may be attractive to ourselves, it is not viable globally.
These are facts which we all seem to have forgotten for the time being.
I believe we ought not to do this in future.
You have listed the main strands in your communication which you published in the first week of September.
They are sound, and cover transport policy, energy policy and environmental policy.
I hope that, this evening in Luxembourg, you will manage to persuade people to adopt the same line because we need to emerge from this crisis now. We need to ensure that the next crisis is not as deep and can be held off for longer than we might anticipate.
At any rate, initiatives should be tabled at European level and a minimum level of cooperation guaranteed in order to help the most needy, as you stated yourself.
This is why I believe that a cut in the general tax burden, as proposed by my party in Belgium, is to be preferred to a specific tax burden on fuel.
What we must not do, whatever happens, is to say to people that energy could become cheap, as this would be the wrong message altogether.
Mr President, we should not wonder at all that we are once again in the midst of a fuel crisis.
This is the third one, and since 1979 energy policy has been little more than a series of failures.
A lot has been said about switching to a sustainable energy policy, but precious little has been done about it.
I welcome the ideas that have been put forward here today by the Commissioner.
Now transport ministers really do have the opportunity to make a definite U-turn in energy policy in the direction of a sustainable energy economy.
Road transport has increased from a 50% share of all transport in 1980 to an 85% share in 2000.
If we were now to reduce fuel taxation generally, this would be very much like lowering the price of heroine on the drugs market.
The end result would surely be that there would be more drug addicts than before and a greater crisis.
We should not be making these kinds of mistakes now.
Nuclear power is not an alternative either in this situation, as only 10% of electricity is produced using oil, and, besides, all the development work going on with regard to new vehicles, for example, is based on the idea that the cars of the future are perhaps more likely to run on hydrogen, but certainly not on nuclear energy.
Our group has today proposed an integrated programme such as this to serve as the European Union' s new energy policy programme.
We want to start implementing this also with regard to the budget, and we are proposing a new budget policy called " New Energy Sources" .
We want to promote energy saving, for example, and better construction technology for homes and buildings.
We also want the European Union to have powers to manage the new energy policy.
We require the issue of energy to be included in the Treaty and have its own chapter there, and we want to stress how important it is to rid ourselves of the requirement of unanimity with regard to taxation.
For almost ten years, we have been trying to establish a common energy tax in the European Union.
Commission Members have come and gone, but this problem has always remained unsolved.
In the short term we have to help the direct victims of this oil crisis, but it has to be done with the proper care and focus.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is my impression that this so-called fuel crisis reveals a number of structural problems which the European Union and the fifteen Member States should be dare to examine in every possible aspect.
The first of these problems concerns our relations with the South, in the event the producer countries.
Did Europe worry, at the beginning of last year, about the disastrous consequences for the economies and populations of a number of these countries when the price of a barrel of oil fell to less than USD 10?
This was hailed as good news when, in fact, the situation was just as worrying as an increase in the price to USD 34.
We need to establish a genuine long-term partnership between these countries and ourselves.
And then, all the other root causes of the current situation need to be looked at: cases of speculation, the inadequate stocks in the United States and the fall in the value of the euro.
The second problem revealed, in my view, by this crisis is the lack of coherence between our strategy choices within the Union.
The talk nowadays is of giving priority to rail over road transport and going in for piggybacking.
That is basic, a real social choice and an ecologically responsible act in the strongest sense of the term.
But for how long has exactly the opposite strategy been adopted, with road transport being pushed hard at the expense of rail?
Europe is so little prepared for this development that, today, you still have to change trains between France and Italy because the value of electrical current supply in the two countries are incompatible.
The third fundamental problem illustrated spectacularly by this crisis is the extreme difficulty many European leaders have in making an accurate assessment of grass-root demands.
They have not seen, or have not wanted to see, the serious problems which this rise in fuel costs presented for people obliged to use their cars or dependent upon domestic fuel oil.
Our fellow citizens are not prepared to shoulder the burden of this economic crisis, and they are protesting at the way in which countries have indulged the oil companies, even though the latter have been quite shameless in the profits they have been making.
More and more pressure is going to be exerted in favour of a reduction in fuel tax and an appropriate levy on oil companies' profits.
The majority of my group is of the view that the Fifteen ought to take radical environmental measures, effectively promoting rail transport while responding, in the present context, to this legitimate social expectation.
In so doing, they would also do Europe what I think is a currently much needed service.
Mr President, the excessive rise in the price of oil is not without its causes, but there is a risk that, because of its own large share of responsibility for these causes, Europe will not take account of them.
The prime cause is the increase in production prices due to the oligopoly carefully organised by the oil-producing countries.
The short supply of oil has been exacerbated by the sanctions against Iraq, the unjust and immoral continuation of which may be in the interests of the American oil companies but is contrary to the interests of Europe.
The second cause is the depreciation of the euro and, therefore, of all the participating European currencies.
It was valued at USD 1.18 when it was launched.
It is now valued at only USD 0.85.
We were promised a strong currency.
It was a lie, and now we are having to foot a much higher bill.
The third cause is the excessive, even insane, taxation practised by the Member States, and this proto-socialist policy has been continued, if not actually initiated, by conservative governments.
It is maintained under pressure from green organisations which are hostile to the motor car because it represents freedom for the individual.
It is taxation of this kind which multiplies the increase in farm gate prices by a factor of 3, 4 or 5.
The alignment of our foreign policy with that of the United States, the depreciation of the euro as a currency and the increase in taxation due to pressure from green campaigners are the three causes of the increase, which we deplore but for which our institutions bear a very heavy responsibility.
Mr President, Commissioner, in the last fortnight, we have seen a real euro-shambles where transport is concerned, with a petrol shortage, road blockades, mass protests and governments disabled.
You really would have thought you were back in 1973 after the first oil crisis.
And that is not counting the plummeting euro and the explosion in the price of a barrel of crude oil, factors not anticipated in the past oracular pronouncements by self-styled experts on Europe.
Largely predictable though it was, this crisis is as much the responsibility of the oil producers as of government.
Many varied solutions have been put forward, for the situations and the reasons for them are different from one country to another.
Many of these solutions are perfectly rational and obvious and, occasionally, ideological such as restrictions on vehicles or the eco-tax but, as you reminded us, none of these is a panacea that will in itself sort out the situation.
It should be remembered that what chiefly distinguishes the fuel question is its relation to currency and taxation issues and the way it goes on to affect urban and rural planning.
For, if this crisis affects people in their working lives, it also affects people in their private lives, especially in rural areas where the car is still too often the main means of transport and communication and the one to which people resort.
It is a situation resulting from the gradual withdrawal of public services which has not been offset by private operators, who are much too concerned with maximising their profits.
Strategies relating to taxation, the currency and urban and rural planning are matters for each Member State and each Member State alone, in accordance with the sacrosanct principle of subsidiarity.
To conclude, we want to see lower fuel tax because, at present, it is too much of a burden on the people of Europe, in both their private and working lives.
However, there are additional strategies open to our Member States.
The European Union must leave the latter free to exercise their sovereignty in making judicious strategy choices when it comes to energy savings, supplementary forms of renewable energy, the redistribution of freight to the railways and rivers and the development of public transport and the opening up of rural areas.
Mr President, this is actually the third oil crisis we have had, but it contrasts sharply with the other two.
They were political crises of man-made origin, and they came about in 1973 and 1979 with the fall of the Shah regime.
For fifteen years now there have clear indications and studies - for example, Global 2000, the report compiled for Jimmy Carter - to the effect that there would be a real shortage in raw materials by the turn of the century.
In other words, the third oil crisis we are experiencing now, is here to stay.
Whether the price drops again in the short term is of no consequence because there will be a steady upward trend in the long term.
It even says in Colin Campbell' s study - anyone interested in having a copy can get one from me - that there will be a shortage of raw materials, i.e. oil, in the early years of the 21st century, the reason being that the production curve has passed its peak.
I therefore believe that even demonstrations are onto a loser, because you can only squeeze so much juice from a lemon.
We will still have oil, but it will not come cheap.
In other words, the price of oil will rise to between USD 40 and 60 in the future.
There are enough studies to this effect.
Even if they should prove to be wrong, now is the time to consider and analyse them.
Nor is it an OPEC crisis, because only 40% of the oil produced comes from OPEC countries; the remaining 60% comes from non-OPEC countries.
If this was just a man-made crisis, the other oil producers could redress the balance.
Mr President, let us put this matter in perspective.
This is not as much of a crisis as the 1970s.
It is as much a taxpayer' s crisis as an energy crisis.
It is not acceptable for governments to put the blame on OPEC, on oil companies, on peaceful protesters, on other political parties, or even on the European Union for protests about levels of taxation that are too high.
In the UK, tax takes 75% or three-quarters of the price of a litre of petrol or diesel and that is the responsibility of the government, no one else.
Energy supply is more elastic than demand.
We learned this in the 1970s, when higher prices brought more oil fields into production yet did not reduce consumption in the transport sector.
High taxation raises revenue, but fails to cut consumption.
Nevertheless, the price increases and the tax protests are timely, to remind us both about our dependence in Europe on imported energy and about the difficulties we face in achieving environmental objectives such as CO2 emission reduction.
If taxation of energy is to be used for pursuing environmental aids, then the policy has to be transparent and consistent so as to carry public opinion with us.
Where policies are perceived as unfair and inconsistent, as in the UK, then protests will enjoy widespread popular support.
To put fuel taxes up so much as to make industry uncompetitive while reducing taxes on domestic household energy consumption, is crazy politics and bad economics.
Let us not be beguiled by arguments about harmonising taxation, because harmonised taxes under socialists have only one way to go and that is up.
That is not what the taxpayers and consumers of Europe want.
Mr President, the explosion in the prices of oil products illustrates the need to make the euro into a genuinely international currency.
The Americans, like ourselves, are suffering an explosion in farm gate prices.
Since barrels of oil are paid for in dollars, the increase has a greater impact upon countries whose currencies have lost ground against the dollar.
Among these currencies are the euro, the Danish krone, the British pound and a lot of other currencies.
Mrs de Palacio has just emphasised that Europe is the world' s biggest oil importer.
Given this status, it is not right that it should continue to pay for its imports in dollars.
The Socialists are asking the Commission to encourage European oil importers to sign contracts in euros.
An initiative of that kind has a chance of succeeding.
Producers know that the dollar will be certain to lose value against the euro.
For producers, contracts made out in euros could become an insurance against an inevitable economic downturn in the United States.
A word about monetary policy.
The ECB has recently justified keeping tight control of its key interest rates by referring to the inflationary pressure created by the increase in oil prices and in rates of exchange.
According to the ECB, monetary policy cannot remedy this situation in the short term.
Economic policy cannot offer a solution to the rise in oil prices either, and must, in addition, be subject to a rise in the cost of capital.
The ECB says that imported inflation is also a form of inflation to be combated.
I would conclude by saying that the price of oil will be brought down neither by increasing the cost of investments nor by reducing the purchasing power of the people of Europe.
Rather than soothing inflationary fever, is not the ECB' s treatment in danger of damaging the health of the European economy?
Mr President, current petrol and diesel prices strike at the very heart of transport companies and threaten their existence.
Such prices are unacceptable.
I believe we must temporarily reduce the various tax burdens to an economically and socially sustainable level.
Bear in mind that we are not the ones that set the tax rates.
As a European Union, we have set minimum rates of taxation for motor vehicle and mineral oil.
It is the Member States that have the room for manoeuvre.
They have pushed it to the limit, and now we are facing this crisis of high oil prices, they must drop these prices and coordinate them.
We cannot have a situation where, rightly or wrongly, one government caves in but another does not, and where companies in one country have distortions in competition to contend with that companies from another country do not. They get the same prices in the same market but their costs are different.
This is an intolerable state of affairs for the transport sector.
Madam Vice-President, I would suggest that you go to Luxembourg and tell the Transport Ministers, firstly that we need concerted action, and secondly, that we need to see a reduction in costs for the transport sector.
Thirdly, we do not want the Transport Ministers to make empty promises that will be scotched by the Finance Ministers in two weeks' time.
The decisions reached by the 15 Member States this evening, or in the course of the next few days, must be upheld.
They must translate into action.
Some Ministers bemoan the fate of the transport sector, whilst others refuse to reduce or amend taxes. Such two-faced behaviour is unsupportable!
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, we have been sleepwalking for decades.
British Conservatives still are but it is time to wake up.
We have two choices.
One is a bad choice and that is to adopt a short-term fix and cut taxes, abdicate our government responsibilities.
We cannot avoid the other choice and the real question which is: How do we use a finite resource when demand is increasing and we have environmental promises?
The rational choice is to stop the profligate use of petrol and diesel and to change the behaviour of the public and of those involved in transport.
Let us lower and enforce speed limits.
We must lower our dependency on imported petroleum products.
We must adopt alternative fuels - biodiesel, fuel cells, gas and electric cars.
Let us realign the Fifth Frame Work Programme in its mid-term towards much more research into and development of those alternatives.
Let us put more money in the budget, change the decision on programmes like SAVE and Altener.
We do not need a new budget heading.
These heading exist.
Let us put more money in them.
Let us negotiate - but as the European Union - because stability is in the interests not only of oil - importing countries but also of oil - exporting countries.
Good luck, Commissioner, when you go to Luxembourg.
Mr President, yes, Mrs Palacio, you are absolutely right - what we need is dialogue.
Yes, we must increase the financial support, and yes, we oppose cartels and monopolies.
That is all quite true.
But reducing taxation and other things - which, funnily enough, is what certain Members to my left have suggested - is no way to solve the problem.
That would lead nowhere.
OPEC and the oil producing countries will immediately move in to close this gap.
They have a political and economic hold over us.
What chance do we stand against this?
(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski) Have we reduced our consumption?
No.
Mr Jarzembowski, who has just spoken - he can shout loudly, and so can I as it happens - says that there must be a paradigm shift where traffic is concerned.
There is more road transport than there was ten years ago.
It is high time this was changed.
We need a paradigm shift where transport is concerned.
There needs to be more transport via rail and water - let us make it happen.
We need to be less dependent.
Let us pursue a common energy policy, for example.
You, Mrs Palacio, and we MEPs, should call for a common energy policy to be incorporated into the Treaty.
We are still lacking such a policy.
So who is guilty of blocking it to date?
For example, what we need to do, Mrs Palacio, is to get rid of the link between gas and oil prices.
You could do that in tandem with the Commission.
Why are gas prices linked to oil prices?
There is no reason why they should be.
You are the obvious person to bring this about.
We can do all of these things.
There are many things we can do, which the Member States have failed to do so far.
We can use these opportunities.
Unfortunately, I am speaking too fast for the interpreter, and I apologise for this.
Right now, there must be no falling out between groups on the right, and those on the left or in the centre, above or below.
The OPEC States will watch from the sidelines, smile indulgently, and put the prices up.
(Heckling from Mr Jarzembowski)
We must show a united front, and the same goes for the Ministers meeting in the Transport Council - and you, Mr Jarzembowski, would do well to shout less loudly and at last get round to doing something in your transport committee.
Mr President, I would to thank all the Members who have spoken in the debate and point out that there is largely a broad consensus on our approach to this issue.
Ten dollars per barrel of oil was far too low a price and, furthermore, it had negative effects on our economies, although this seems more complicated to explain.
On the other hand, 35 dollars is too high a price for us to bear.
That is why we have to try immediately to persuade OPEC to increase production in order to lower the tension over prices, so that we can really fulfil that "target band" and make the markets more stable.
We should not once again - as the spokesman of the Socialist Group said a moment ago - forget the problem and 'only remember Santa BÃ¡rbara when it thunders' , but we should maintain our action over time.
In the Directorate-General for Energy we have been working since November on the medium-term strategy for energy, and I therefore hope that we will be able to present a quality document in the coming weeks.
We are seeking a medium-term view, which is combined with a review of the Union' s transport policy because it is a fact that energy is a crucial component in transport.
Much of our energy is destined for this specific sector in particular.
This means coordinating the energy policy.
I would like us to try to communitise this, but, in the mean time, we must coordinate the energy policy of the Member States.
It is also necessary to continue making progress on transport policies and we must avoid, as a result of a crisis such as this, suddenly changing our transport policy and energy policy which has been established over recent years.
We must be coherent.
We must not therefore use the method of lowering taxes as a solution to this circumstantial rise in oil prices.
Perhaps, in a very limited way, some countries may resort to that method, above all because there may be an exception in the directive on hydrocarbons.
We could probably consider certain proposals such as postponing the ecotax, but what we cannot do is propose one thing and then its complete opposite.
I repeat that we must have a minimum degree of internal coherence in our policies.
Energy and transport policies are medium- and long-term policies, which cannot be modified under pressure from very specific circumstances, which I am sure are going to change within a year and a half or two years although, no doubt, we will not return to prices of 10 dollars per barrel.
However, they are going to change simply for market reasons, even if OPEC does nothing.
Furthermore, OPEC is prepared to act and I hope that it does so and does so well.
Nevertheless, these long-term measures cannot absolve us of our current responsibilities, responsibilities, which we all share, which range from safeguarding the freedom of movement to complying with Community rules.
But it is also the responsibility of the governments to take measures to alleviate the difficulties and provide solutions for the sectors that are most affected.
We are talking specifically of the transport sector and now, in the Council of Transport Ministers, I hope we will reach some agreements.
There are also problems in the fishing and agricultural sectors, without forgetting that there is another whole series of sectors affected by these difficulties.
We must work on issues such as energy saving, renewable energies, research into biofuels and the use of biomass.
Before the end of the year we will produce a regulation on buildings which this House can deal with.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must now leave you because I am running a little late for the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
So you keep a few Ministers waiting - it could be worse!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Secretariat for joint supervisory data protection bodies
The next item is the report (A5-0225/2000) on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Portuguese Republic with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision [7381/2000 - C5-0230/2000 - 2000/0804(CNS)] establishing a Secretariat for the Joint Supervisory Data Protection Bodies set up by the Convention on the Establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention), the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes and the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement on the gradual abolition of checks at the common borders (Schengen Convention).
Mr President, I have no doubt that in the age of new communications technologies, in the age of the Internet, which is well under way at the beginning of this new century, we legislators are faced with a very exciting challenge: to protect people from intrusion and from attacks on their private life, their dignity or their reputation.
The protection of these rights is recognised in numerous legislative texts of a universal nature, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of a transnational nature, such as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Liberties, or of a national nature, such as the constitutions of the Member States, but the legislative diversity in this area requires that efforts be made in terms of the harmonisation and unification of criteria.
The majority of countries are beginning a legislative process to prevent violations of people' s fundamental rights, such as the right to private life, and this right is also expressly included in Article 8 of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We are therefore facing a legislative challenge of unquestionable importance, which must regulate to ensure that this right is respected and the exceptions which, in a democratic society, it is necessary to establish in order, as the Convention of the Protection of Human Rights says, to safeguard public security, defend public order and prevent crime.
The report which I am presenting to Parliament aims to analyse one of the many aspects involved in this legislative task: the creation of a single secretariat for the three supervisory bodies for the protection of data from Europol, Schengen and customs information, within the framework of the third pillar and in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters enshrined in Chapter VI of the Treaty.
The Council' s proposal for a decision is correct but is, in my view, timid and does not go far enough.
In this delicate field of data protection we must achieve two fundamental objectives: transparency in the future functioning of the secretariat and the independence of its work.
I do not believe that either objective is fully guaranteed in the Council' s proposal, hence the content of the amendments I am proposing, which have been accepted practically unanimously in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights.
Justice and Home Affairs. I wonder whether it is a positive thing, in terms of transparency, to have three joint data protection bodies within the third pillar?
I believe not.
I therefore believe that the final objective should be the establishment of a single body corresponding to a single legal framework within the European Union and that that body be provided with its own budget and staff, even exceeding the normal distribution between pillars, taking advantage of the option provided for in Article 42 of the Treaty of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament is currently examining and debating the consequences for personal and economic relations in the European Union of the discovery of a possible spying network known as the Echelon system, and is also studying a regulation on the protection of physical persons in the processing of data by the institutions of the Community.
We are furthermore now examining this proposal for the third pillar.
As we will see, these are different aspects of the same problem.
I therefore believe that this Parliament must go further than the Council' s decision, which, as I have said, falls short on aspects such as the election and appointment of the secretariat, its dismissal or the guarantee of professional secrecy in its functioning.
Independence is another basic element which is not sufficiently guaranteed in the Council' s proposal.
Parliament is the institution which must guarantee its independence, by means of the democratic control which legitimately corresponds to it.
That is why in the future the body should be appointed by Parliament and the secretariat of the three bodies would enjoy more independence if the costs of staffing and the resources needed for its funding were to be included in section 8B of the general European Union budget, as I propose, and not in the Council' s budget.
Let us not fool ourselves, financial independence is essential to guaranteeing functional independence.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are legislating in a field which is fundamental to the future of our interpersonal, economic and commercial relations.
Our challenge is to create a balance and compatibility between the right to privacy and the right of free access to information.
The introduction of new technologies, computers and telecommunications has broken down barriers and transcended borders.
There has been a genuine revolution in commercial, social and personal relations which have a real effect on the daily lives of citizens: health, advertising, banking transactions, or even aspects which relate to the security and defence of citizens, and of States themselves, can be jeopardised if there are no rules to guarantee the correct transmission and storage of the data which today circulate with total freedom and which are not immune to the serious danger of indiscriminate use.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar on the excellent report he has presented to us, which the Group of the European People's Party endorses and which gained the almost unanimous support of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
This is a small step forward, but one which signals the beginnings of a strategy for harmonisation which, we hope, will be enacted under the third pillar.
We are thus beginning to move towards harmonisation, with the creation of a joint secretariat for the various supervisory bodies.
We hope that a set of common regulations for supervision and for a single supervisory body can be adopted in the medium term.
This is crucial if we are to guarantee that the public' s fundamental right to privacy is respected, safeguarding the legal principle of fair and equal treatment for all citizens. Laws must be applied and interpreted according to the same criteria, providing the same level of data protection.
In fact, there is no justification for the existence of three separate joint supervisory bodies.
Today, in addition to national supervisory bodies, there are also these three joint supervisory bodies, each with its own secretariat.
The question is: can this system really guarantee effective protection?
I do not think it can.
These bodies therefore need to be merged into one single entity as soon as possible, with legal personality and its own budget, which will ensure that it is impartial and independent from the other institutions, as Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar has just said, and he is quite right.
This is a matter of protecting the interests and rights of our citizens.
There is also a vital need to create a single legal framework in the European Union to provide citizens with sufficient guarantees, essentially by preventing the improper use or dissemination of personal data and by remedying the shortcomings in the current system of protection.
The constitutions in force in the various Member States recognise the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Union' s draft Charter of Fundamental Rights also expressly upholds every citizen' s right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
The very fact that different laws exist in each country, however, raises various problems that can be overcome by adopting minimum standards which will make it possible to harmonise these national laws, thereby guaranteeing that citizens' fundamental rights are respected, and specifically the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression and of information.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increasingly complex nature of society and of economic life, backed up by ever more powerful technology, is creating new situations which threaten the individual rights of our citizens and leave them unprotected.
This requires us to establish appropriate mechanisms for protecting our citizens from potential abuses of these rights.
The current system, which is designed to protect people' s privacy and which guarantees all citizens' inalienable right to privacy with regard to the computerised processing of their personal data, is widely considered to be inefficient. This is because in addition to national data protection supervisory bodies there are still three joint supervisory bodies in the European Union, each with its own secretariat.
In order to combat this duplication of supervisory bodies, which leads to inefficiency, the Portuguese have drawn up an initiative for a proposal with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision to create a single secretariat for the three joint data protection supervisory bodies.
In the current circumstances, it is generally accepted that this is a viable solution which would reduce the problems caused by the existence of three data protection supervisory bodies within the Union.
The rapporteur' s suggestion that a single data protection supervisory body should be created, with a single secretariat, with legal personality and its own budget is also to be welcomed.
This would create ideal conditions for achieving our stated aims of protecting our citizens' private life and individual freedoms, without, on the other hand, impeding the free flow of information, which is the hallmark of modern societies.
The rapporteur recognises that it is not feasible to set up this single body in the European Union in the short term, and refers in his report to establishing it in the medium term, under the third pillar.
Whilst I congratulate the rapporteur on his work, I should also like to draw your attention to the risk of postponing the creation of this authority for years and years.
It might have been wiser for the report to have set a fixed and reasonable deadline for this body to be established, which would give more force to the proposal put forward by the rapporteur and the European Parliament.
Mr President, rapporteur, I welcome any initiative that aims to improve data protection for the people of the European Union.
However, there are serious problems with the EUROPOL and Schengen Conventions, and as regards customs cooperation.
One of these is the inadequate level of protection for data collated and processed in the institutions.
As far as I am concerned, it goes without saying that the proposed secretariat must be independent of the institutions requiring monitoring, as is borne out by the fact that it has its own budget.
Yet still I cannot vote in favour of Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar' s report.
I ask myself this: why should bringing all those who have been responsible for data protection hitherto, together in one secretariat headed by one General Secretary, lead to improvements in data protection merely because it is certain to lead to savings in this sphere?
Bringing these officials together under one roof will not guarantee better data protection.
Taking an overall political view, I see Portugal' s initiative, together with the report, as being one more step along the way towards improving coordination between Schengen and EUROPOL.
When it comes to the problems associated with the aforesaid conventions, inadequate data protection is the least of our worries.
Both EUROPOL and Schengen will add hugely to the construction of fortress Europe.
Fundamental human rights such as the right to freedom of movement, the right to asylum, or in many cases, even the simple right to human dignity, will be compromised, and these institutions will support and control this.
Therefore, I cannot vote in favour of an initiative that may bring about a mild improvement, when it will also help legitimise these institutions as a result.
Since I am basically critical of EUROPOL, and Schengen in general, and I believe that having one General Secretary instead of three does not equal better data protection, I intend to abstain.
Mr President, this report deals with issues which are of very great importance to personal privacy and data protection.
Within the EU, extensive registers of personal data are now being compiled in which very sensitive personal information is stored.
At the same time, it is obvious that these registers are inadequately supervised and insufficiently secure.
Those of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left are obviously keen to improve data protection and supervision.
We therefore support the idea of introducing a single independent supervisory authority with proper powers and resources.
To that extent, we are in favour of the basic ideas in this report but we wish, however, to point out that it is important to construct this supervisory authority on the basis of the skills possessed by the Member States in this area.
A new supervisory authority must be able to cover all the relevant registers, including the Eurodac register which has a major role to play in the EU' s asylum policy.
Refugees are an especially vulnerable group, and information contained on a register can be a direct reason for deporting people and so have serious consequences for an asylum seeker.
It is therefore especially important to be able to see to it that the register contains accurate information, that the asylum seeker is provided with information about his or her rights and that there are opportunities for appeal.
Moreover, the Sirene organisation established under the Schengen agreement must be covered by a new supervisory authority.
By and large, the relatively little known Sirene can send any personal data at all between Member States at short notice, as well as combine data relating to ordinary police matters with that concerning state security and policy on refugees.
The whole of the Sirene organisation suffers from a palpable lack of public and parliamentary control.
We already have significant experience in this area when it comes to dealing with the Schengen agreement' s large register of personal data, SIS.
That experience is unfortunately very disheartening.
The Joint Supervisory Authority, or JSA, has had quite inadequate resources.
Moreover, it has been denied access to important information in SIS.
This may be seen from the JSA' s first annual reports.
In spite of the difficult working conditions, the JSA reveals serious deficiencies in SIS, for example incorrect information on file, instances of Member States' illegally copying information and inadequate procedures for gaining access to registers.
This is completely unacceptable.
In order to obtain effective data protection, more than effective supervision is required.
More basic changes are needed when it comes to the rules governing the registers.
One requirement is that registers of criminals be distinguished from registers of refugees and registers kept to protect state security.
These different areas must not be covered by joint organisations and registers.
Public and parliamentary control must be reinforced, especially when it comes to Sirene and Schengen.
Moreover, clear limits must be set for what may be recorded in Europol' s investigation register, founded upon Article 10.1 of the Europol Convention.
At present, the scope of the register goes far beyond what is necessary.
People who are not suspected of crimes may be registered, and sensitive personal data about political views, religious affiliation and sexual orientation may be recorded.
That is unreasonable.
A central place must be given to personal privacy and legal rights.
Mr President, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, for his valuable work in drafting this report.
In matters of data protection we have to make the difficult compromise between the protection of privacy, the safety of our citizens, and the stability of the Single Market.
A basic pre-condition of a market in a Europe with no internal borders is that information flows unhindered and fast.
As the visible supervision of the movement of goods and services has come to an end, the importance of so-called invisible supervision has grown year after year.
The rapid exchange of information between official bodies is the only chance we have of preventing criminal exploitation of the benefits of this free movement.
The level of data protection in today' s bit streams is still not adequate in the European Union.
The fundamental human right of confidentiality as far as mail is concerned is being jeopardised, for example through criminal activity and inquiries carried out using email systems.
The rapid growth in ecommerce in particular is posing new threats to the protection of data concerning our citizens.
For example, the theft of credit card information and the abuse of personal ID are growing dramatically in the information networks.
In addition, databases established for purposes of marketing, which contain details of people' s way of life and consumer habits, are often in conflict with basic rights which are there to protect privacy.
It is reasonable to suppose that the work of the various data protection bodies working now in the EU area can be made more effective through centralisation.
The founding of a joint body with respect to the work of Europol, customs control and the ordinary fundamental rights of EU citizens is an excellent idea.
At the same time, however, we must ensure that there are adequate resources available.
The workload is increasing at a ferocious rate.
And one must clarify ways of making data protection cooperation more effective between the Secretariat to be created and the national authorities.
The independence of data protection bodies is the key to success here.
Supervision always leads to difficult interpretations of a situation, the outcome of which many players may well wish to influence, owing to purely financial interests.
Because of this, the bodies will have to work in close cooperation with the EU and national courts of justice.
The European Parliament must monitor closely the work and accountability of the official Secretariat to be set up from a position of impartiality.
Mr President, ladies and gentleman, first of all, the Commission wishes to thank the rapporteur, Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar, for the excellent report that he has presented and acknowledge that our participation in this debate has been made easier by the fact that we broadly agree with and support the approach he has proposed.
The Commission is pleased with the initiative that has been taken by the Portuguese Government, as we feel that it will contribute to our efforts to rationalise, in a sensible way, the administrative support provided to the bodies responsible for supervising and guaranteeing data protection established by the Europol Convention, the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes and the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement.
The Commission shares the rapporteur' s view that a single supervisory body needs to be created for these three instruments, because a single supervisory body would ensure that the principles of data protection are applied more coherently, both under the Schengen Convention and the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes. The creation of a single supervisory body would also prevent an undesirable duplication of work.
Similarly, the Commission agrees with the idea that a range of common essential principles on data protection needs to be established and can be implemented as uniformly as possible throughout the third pillar.
It is true that there are currently shortcomings in the Community legal framework in this area.
We are pleased that a specialist Council Group has initiated the debate on these common general principles and also that the French Presidency has already made it clear that this issue is one of its priorities.
We must recognise that this is not an easy task, not only because of the sophistication of the technology, but also because it is particularly important for us to find a solution that strikes a balance between safeguarding citizens' rights and freedoms on the one hand and on the other, having the instruments needed to ensure that the democratic rule of law is respected and that we can effectively fight transnational and organised crime.
I feel sure that our first task must be to define these common principles, which can then be translated into the various legislative instruments that we will need to adopt in the coming years under the third pillar.
This approach also involves - as various speakers have already pointed out - introducing, either under the Europol Convention or under new laws based on the Schengen Convention, clear and transparent principles of democratic and judicial supervision, which will guarantee the fundamental values on which a Union governed by the rule of law must be based.
Perhaps the most difficult issue that this report raises is the problem of deciding whether a separate budget heading should be created for the joint secretariat.
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur' s assertion that it is extremely important to guarantee the independence of this secretariat in relation to the Council itself.
The idea that we are therefore advocating, even if this issue can potentially only be resolved in the long term, is to create a separate budget heading.
Nevertheless, we understand that for the moment, the Council' s prime concern is that the creation of a new budget heading could cause delays in setting up a joint secretariat.
So in practical terms the Commission understands the Council' s desire to use existing financial structures, but only as a provisional measure.
In the event that the Council decides to uphold its position, the Commission will back Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar' s proposal, which is to reiterate the recitals put forward by the rapporteur so as to make it quite clear that these are merely provisional financial arrangements pending the creation of a single supervisory body responsible for data protection under the three conventions.
To conclude, I am delighted that this report and its underlying principles have received such widespread support in the European Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Eurodac
The next item is the report (A5-0219/2000) by Mr Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of finger prints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (renewed consultation) [8417/2000 - C5-0256/2000 - 1999/0116(CNS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we are able to celebrate a ten-year anniversary almost exactly to the day.
Almost exactly ten years ago to the day, we started discussing which country should in fact be responsible for processing asylum applications.
Then the Dublin Convention came into force.
Yet, to this day, we have failed to make Dublin truly enforceable, in other words, we have been unable to establish a suitable instrument of control.
We have been discussing the fact that we need an instrument of this kind, for years, but so far to no avail, and tomorrow we will have our one and only chance to actually complete Eurodac.
I would be delighted if we could.
A great many Council Presidents, who have held office in the intervening period, would be delighted too, and everyone has promised that they will make it an absolute priority to try and make Eurodac a reality.
This has been a long, drawn-out business, and it concerns an important issue.
Why do we need Eurodac and what can it do?
Eurodac is a system that will enable us to compare fingerprints and ascertain in an appropriate manner, which country was the first point of contact for the refugee, and, as such, which country is responsible for processing the asylum application. This will also allow for a distribution of the burden amongst the Member States.
And, of course, it is also an instrument that will be used to establish if an applicant has submitted asylum applications before.
In other words, it is also an instrument for fighting abuse and illegal activity. It is an instrument that we both want, and need, to have at all costs.
As I said, it has been a long, drawn-out business and the last time we discussed it in Parliament was December 1999.
The vast majority of us were agreed, firstly on the fact that we must get Eurodac up and running, and secondly, on the conditions under which it should be implemented.
Above all, we have seen eye to eye with Commissioner Vitorino throughout, and I would like to thank him, because he has moved heaven and earth to enable Eurodac to at last become a reality.
Parliament established that the implementing powers would be conferred on the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the EC Treaty.
However, immediately after we had taken this decision, the Council met in December and, for reasons which we do not understand at all, shelved these joint proposals from Parliament and the Commission, and reserved the most important implementing powers for itself.
Consequently, because there had been a substantial amendment, this required reconsultation of Parliament, i.e. we have had to review the situation, albeit only in respect of the relevant points, i.e. Articles 22 and 23 alone.
We confined ourselves to these areas in committee, with the exception of Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, who sparked off a new discussion.
I do not know what she was hoping to achieve in this way.
The object of the exercise was simply to deal with Articles 22 and 23.
The new proposal relating to these articles accommodates the Council' s wish to retain sole responsibility for the most important implementing powers, i.e. those regarding the collection, transmission and comparison of fingerprints, those for the blocking of the data concerning applicants for asylum, and those for drawing up statistics on asylum applicants.
There was unanimous agreement in committee that we should stand by our original proposal and reject that of the Council.
Why?
For two quite crucial reasons.
Firstly, the Council' s move is contrary to Article 202 of the EC Treaty, which establishes the principle that the implementation of the rules which the Council lays down shall be conferred on the Commission.
This is particularly important in this case.
The Commission could take a far more impartial - i.e. it would be less likely to accommodate specific national interests - and objective line when it comes to implementing this regulation.
Therefore we as a Parliament support this.
There is also a second reason as to why we oppose the Council' s proposal.
It works against Parliament because it excludes us, because there is no longer a comitology procedure, and because we will no longer have access or entitlement to the information we need.
This proposal would whittle away Parliament' s rights.
For these two highly convincing reasons, we are in favour of the proposal submitted by the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino, to the effect that implementing powers should be bestowed on the Commission, and I would urge you all to attend tomorrow' s vote.
This will be our opportunity to make Europe a safer place, and to take action against abuse.
Let us seize this opportunity and use this chance to at last make Eurodac a reality.
I should very much like to support what Mr Pirker has just said.
As a past Minister for Immigration and Asylum in the United Kingdom, I am well aware that the confusion with regard to determining which country should deal with any particular application has been an immense problem and one that has created a considerable level of friction between Members of the European Union.
Unless it is tackled urgently, it will continue to be an area of friction as we look at the enlargement process.
The Dublin Convention in itself has always been important but it is the flaws in the Dublin Convention and our failure to administer the Dublin Convention properly, which has caused issues to arise which could even threaten the human rights of some of the applicants and individuals concerned.
All the countries that are signatories to the United Nations Convention of 1951 are well aware of the criteria for determining whether someone should be granted the extremely valuable and significant status of a refugee and I hope that nothing we ever do here would affect the right to make an application within those criteria.
However - with new technology, with new travelling arrangements, and indeed with people who want to abuse the system using that technology - it has become more and more difficult for the authorities to treat people in an appropriate and fair manner in handling their cases.
Eurodac has to run hand in hand with the reform of the Dublin Convention and I am somewhat concerned at the attitude that the Council has adopted in the past.
Mr Pirker has spoken of the delays that have occurred and the numerous times that this vital issue has been reconsidered.
My feelings are clear: if the Council wishes to reserve powers to itself when the information from Eurodac should be available to this democratic body, Parliament, then that is unacceptable.
That is all the more reason why we need to treat this matter with urgency, why we need to resolve it, and why Parliament should continue to play a strong role in the future in the superintendence and monitoring of vital issues relating to the granting refugee status to those who might apply.
I fully support Mr Pirker and I hope we make strong moves now to conclude this matter in the interests of everybody.
Mr President, as the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, has said, this Parliament has already expressed its opinion more than once on the proposed Eurodac Agreement.
Last time it expressed its opinion on the proposal as a whole and I believe that the position Parliament adopted was very close to what the Socialist Group wanted.
I wish to defend Parliament' s position, which this House voted for a few months ago in relation to the Eurodac Agreement.
I therefore believe that we are now being consulted on an amendment which the Council is introducing in this communication, and that it affects the allocation of competences for this action by the Council.
The Treaty established that the Commission must have responsibility for implementation - for Eurodac also, we believe - and also established that Parliament can supervise what the Commission does.
This still does not seem sufficient to us, and we hope that, at least in the legislative and supervisory field, we can have further competences.
For this reason, my Group is tomorrow going to abstain in the vote on all the amendments which do not relate to this change to the Council' s communication.
We are going to abstain on those amendments which we feel have already been approved by Parliament and which are already included in this Parliament' s previous report.
We are going to abstain for reasons which I imagine are very different from Mr Pirker' s reasons for voting against it, but we are going to abstain in order to maintain the position which Parliament has already expressed.
However, on behalf of my group, I would like to express my support for the amendments proposed by Mr Pirker, for the reasons which I have already expressed, because I believe that the previous proposal was better and because I believe that the Commission must take this project forward.
I hope that it does so taking account of Parliament' s decision and it is important that tomorrow' s vote shows Parliament' s strong support for the previous proposal.
Mr President, we are developing a third pillar on the basis of policies which have been intergovernmental and which must become Community policies.
I believe it is very important for Parliament to support these first actions we are taking and also to support the Commission so that it can play the role accorded it by the Treaty.
The ELDR Group fully supports Mr Pirker in his insistence that Article 202 of the Treaty should be followed in its general rule that implementation powers for this regulation should be conferred on the Commission.
He is absolutely right to argue that the Commission is in a stronger position to take an impartial view which does not bend to accommodate specific national interests and therefore it is arguably more capable of drawing up adequate data-protection safeguards.
Secondly, although Parliament may have its arguments with the Commission from time to time, we do have a much better chance of exercising democratic supervision if the Commission has the implementing powers than if the Council has them. This is because the regulatory committee procedure, coupled with the interinstitutional agreement, entitles Parliament to receive draft implementing measures.
And when - rather than if - we achieve codecision in this area, this will enable Parliament to require the Commission to re-examine the measures if the implementing measures are exceeded.
We would be foolish, as a Parliament, to rely on the Council' s goodwill rather than on rights which we possess if the Commission has the implementing powers.
That is why my group will abstain on some of the amendments of substance which would alter the substantive details of the Eurodac regulation.
My group supported these amendments when the focus was on the substance but at this stage it is better to concentrate on the issue of whether the Commission or Council has implementing powers so that we in Parliament state loudly and in unison that our interests lie in backing the Commission.
That is the only issue that we ought to concentrate on now and, perhaps with some slight regret, we feel that Parliament' s position needs to be slimmed down to Mr Pirker' s points on comitology.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are now facing a fairly unusual procedure which deserves a detailed explanation so that everyone can vote in the full knowledge of what is explicitly and implicitly at stake in this matter.
Last November, the majority of the European Parliament adopted a report on the creation of the Eurodac system.
Following this vote, the Council modified its proposal for a regulation, stating that the Eurodac system for comparing fingerprints should be established and administered by the Council rather than the Commission.
This important change is the reason why this report is being re-examined by this Chamber.
In the opinion of our Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, it was the Commission rather than the Council that should be given responsibility for administering this new facility, Eurodac.
Indeed, the Commission quite rightly emphasised that, as the only Community institution of the Union, it ought to have responsibility for administering a Community programme like Eurodac, and not in any circumstances the Council, which is an intergovernmental body.
We wholly support the Commission on this.
However, the new proposal being examined today has not taken any account whatsoever of the amendments Parliament has voted in favour of.
Whether it be about specifying 18 years as the minimum age at which an applicant for asylum can be registered on the Eurodac database, about erasing personal data once legally recognised status has been acquired or about substituting the expression 'third-country national' for 'alien' , the Council has not seen fit to take account of Parliament' s opinion and has been supported in this by the Commission, which has also declined to take account of it.
It is in view of this situation that I am today asking you again to uphold the vote which Parliament wisely held last year.
This means voting on the text adopted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which includes the amendments relating to the lower age limit of 18 years, the erasing of personal data in the case of any applicant who has achieved legal status and the use of the expression 'third-country national' rather than 'alien' .
The amendments to the report proposed by the Group of the European People' s Party, to which the rapporteur belongs, should therefore be rejected.
I really find it difficult to understand how anyone can remain silent and avoid taking sides and consider taking fingerprints from 14-year-old adolescents to be a legitimate action, when it is something which contravenes all the international treaties in force, particularly those on the rights of the child.
When it comes to erasing personal data, it is just a question of being sensible.
Once the applicant concerned has obtained legal status, there is in fact no justification for retaining the personal data and fingerprints of someone whose situation has been regularised in law.
That would be to view him as a potential criminal.
It is not solely in the future Charter that the protection of fundamental rights, close to our hearts as it is, becomes an issue, but also in every European text, where we must be vigilant in their defence.
What is at stake is Parliament' s credibility in the eyes of those who already have a lot of difficulty putting their trust in us.
The people of Europe find it incomprehensible, and surprising to say the least, that the European Parliament should one day come out in favour of a report only, a few months later, to go back on its decision and vote in favour of a radically different report.
How can our electorate have confidence in a Parliament which changes its views according to the way the wind blows and which is incapable of facing up to the Commission and the Council which do not, for all that, have the democratic legitimacy with which we have as an institution.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would today ask you to vote in such a way as to reaffirm last November' s vote and to adopt the report in the form presented to you by the committee.
It is in adopting coherent and consistent positions that Parliament will enhance its stature.
Mr President, today' s debate has its pitfalls inasmuch as we are being asked to amend, or to refuse to amend, a system, namely the Eurodac system, which our group has comprehensively rejected.
The Eurodac system is part and parcel of a general tendency to criminalise and penalise immigrants and those who are being persecuted the world over.
It reveals the true face of liberal Europe, which is setting itself up as a besieged fortress.
How can anyone imagine that it is by means of repressive laws that the starving of the earth are to be prevented from coming to Europe, even at the risk of their lives, as has been seen recently at Dover and in Gibraltar.
On the contrary, it is, as we all know, these combined weapons of criminalisation which force thousands of foreigners to become illegal immigrants who then fall victim to smugglers, slave merchants or unscrupulous bosses who grossly exploit them.
Regularising the status of illegal immigrants en masse is the way to put a spoke in the wheels of all these dealers in human misery.
It is these combined weapons of criminalisation which will erode our own freedoms, as witness the French Presidency' s plan, which we shall have to express our opinion on. This plan is aimed at cracking down on anyone who comes to the aid of an immigrant without the proper papers.
It is because of these weapons and because of this strategy that, today in France, a boy of Tamil origin is imprisoned with his mother in the Aranc detention centre waiting for a judgement from the Minister of the Interior and, in all likelihood, his expulsion from the country.
Recording people' s fingerprints on computer is an attack on individual freedom.
It systematically treats asylum seekers as suspects and puts a question mark over the confidentiality of the documents held by the bodies responsible for examining their applications.
It infringes the legal protection due to refugees in being applied even to 14-year-olds.
It contravenes the International Declaration on the Rights of the Child and, in particular, Article 10 of this.
Who, among you here, would dare take the fingerprints of a young lad of 14?
The Eurodac project makes criminals of immigrants without proper papers, often deprived of legal status because of the differences in the laws between one European country and another.
It fundamentally violates all the international conventions protecting human rights.
With this project, Fortress Europe is guilty of failing to assist refugees who are in danger.
This is hardly a surprise coming from a liberal Europe which equips the Ankara dictatorship with combat helicopters at the same time as rejecting Kurdish refugees.
At a time when a wave of racism and xenophobia is forming across Europe and when consideration is being given to drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights, you ought to reject Eurodac, with or without amendments.
It is our own freedoms that are at stake.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Radical Members of the Bonino List, I would like to express concern and strong opposition to a Europe which, especially in its gradual creation of a so-called Area of Freedom, Justice and Security, is following the intergovernmental road, which only incorporates elements that are repressive and destroy freedoms and trample underfoot the rights of the citizens of the European Union and the Member States.
The Eurodac incident is an example of this: without having defined any kind of European political asylum policy at all, the Member States, through the Council, created the Dublin Convention, which legalises mutual backscratching as regards applicants for asylum and the examination of their applications for political asylum in our Member States.
At this point, in order to bring the Convention into operation, the Council promoted the creation of the Eurodac system, and initially made the Commission responsible for its implementation.
However, it then decided to go further and extend electronic fingerprinting to illegal immigrants, removed the management responsibilities from the Commission, and took them directly upon itself.
In the face of this confusion, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is right, through Mr Pirker' s report, to restore these responsibilities to the Commission and to make other amendments of substance which we fully support.
Having said that, since we do not, however, support the basic bureaucratic, repressive approach sustained by the Council and abetted by the Commission, which is reflected in the Dublin Convention and the EURODAC system, we will vote for the amendments of substance tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs but against the legislative resolution, for it leaves the way almost completely open for this absurd piece of legislation which introduces the systematic compilation of police records on refugees and illegal immigrants at European level: a legal, political and humanitarian atrocity.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to speak about the issues underlying the proposal for a regulation, which have been so thoroughly studied and discussed in committee and in this Chamber, a process that culminated in the vote on Parliament' s opinion last November.
It is nevertheless worthwhile saying, in line with the views of the rapporteur Mr Pirker and of the Commission itself, how incomprehensible we find it that in the new text, the Council proposes to reserve to itself responsibility for implementing the Eurodac regulation, which departs from the system previously envisaged, in which these powers would fall to the Commission.
We are unhappy with this, firstly because Parliament, as has already been pointed out, is seeing its rights diminished, specifically its right to remain informed.
In fact, the Commission is, in general terms, obliged, under the terms of Article 7 of the decision on comitology, to keep Parliament informed of committee proceedings and whenever the Commission transmits relevant measures or proposals to the Council.
With this new text, this prerogative is clearly undermined.
Secondly, there is a lack of legal coherence and above all a lack of legal justification in these transfers of competence.
Article 1 of the decision on comitology has not been respected and therefore this course of action breaches Article 202 of the Treaty, since this article contains no provisions that would justify this procedure being adopted in this specific case.
Our view is that the generally accepted status of the Commission is still valid: it is the guardian of the treaties, equidistant from each of the Member States; it is autonomous, independent and the defender of the common good. It is the Commission rather than the Member States that is responsible - transcending borders and national peculiarities - for drafting laws that provide adequate protection on issues involving fundamental freedoms.
The Council has demonstrated its lack of confidence in the Commission.
Without wishing to appear perverse, perhaps the Council is looking for a legal fight over this issue, which would clear the way for an almost certain application to the European Court of Justice to delay the universal implementation of the new Community legislation in progress on the right to asylum.
Sometimes in politics, things are indeed what they seem!
Unfortunately, Commissioner, and this is not your fault, this is a matter on which you cannot allay our fears.
Mr President, I am grateful to Commissioner Vitorino for his work.
I speak for some Members on this side of the House in saying that there are concerns about this report.
We are not one hundred percent happy.
We wish we were not at this stage today, but I look at this from the point of view - which I share with several colleagues, that we do not want asylum seekers to be seen as criminals.
Criminals have their fingerprints taken and we need not automatically or in any way assume that asylum seekers ought to be put into this category.
Many of them are escaping from terror, from torture, from other experiences.
We want to make certain that at our frontiers they are not put through similar experiences and practices again.
I accept what Mr Kirkhope said a few minutes ago, that there are frictions and difficulties with the system which need to be sorted out.
Other colleagues have referred to the issue of fingerprinting 14-year-olds, which has been very sensitive and very emotive.
On this side of the House we are realistic.
That is why we are looking for the safeguards that have been put into the report.
It is why we would prefer that there be parliamentary scrutiny in the question of Commission versus Council.
We believe that Parliament is there to safeguard citizens and make certain that the asylum policy is carried out in the fairest possible way.
With those reservations and I know I speak on behalf of several colleagues - I will be following Mrs TerrÃ³n' s line.
We wish the Commission well in this work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all the Commission wishes to thank the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and especially Mr Pirker, for the speed with which the renewed consultation on the Eurodac project has proceeded, as well as for the quality of the proposals that have been presented.
I should like to begin by reminding honourable Members that the Tampere European Council requested that the Eurodac system be completed as quickly as possible.
We can conclude from this report that the Commission and the European Parliament have played their part in this task most speedily.
What is under discussion today is merely a new consultation on the specific issue of comitology.
I am not going to comment again on the fundamentals of the Eurodac system, but I would like to remind you, and particularly Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, that following the debate in the European Parliament the Commission submitted an amended proposal.
Although it is true that this amended proposal did not include all the amendments approved by the European Parliament, it must at least be recognised that some of the suggestions made by Parliament were incorporated.
Therefore, on the only issue which is still under discussion - comitology - the Commission wishes to remind Parliament of the position it adopted towards the Council: we disagree with the Council' s decision to reserve to itself the power to lay down most of the implementing rules here.
This factor was crucial in the commitments that the Commission made to you, the European Parliament, with regard to our reasons for being prepared to participate in a Eurodac system.
One of the crucial factors is that, if the system is managed and implemented by the Commission, there is a guarantee of effective control by the European Parliament.
Some of the doubts as to the legitimacy of the Eurodac system could be dispelled by bringing these two elements together, with responsibility for the management and implementation of the system falling to the Commission and democratic control to the European Parliament.
Secondly, it is our view that the Council' s decision is not properly underpinned by the principles and criteria governing the actual comitology rules.
We will therefore continue to state our position to the Council, which is that we would have a win-win situation if the solution adopted were the one for which the Commission has always fought.
Lastly, I should like once more to make it clear to Parliament that we have not used these doubts or this quarrel about interpretation in relation to Eurodac as an excuse for inaction: the Commission has already submitted a working paper on revising the Dublin Convention, which it has in fact sent to the European Parliament.
It is our view that the shortcomings and errors in the workings of the Dublin Convention show precisely why we need a European asylum policy.
I am particularly pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission has today given substance to a key aspect of the Tampere mandate on asylum by approving a proposal for a directive on minimum rules for a common procedure for requests for asylum.
This shows that we are not working on a piecemeal basis; we are putting together a jigsaw puzzle, a jigsaw that involves revising the Dublin Convention.
Another piece of this jigsaw is the decision that we have adopted today, to propose a directive on minimum standards for a common asylum procedure, and another piece is the preparatory technical work on the Eurodac system, which has not stood still, but is continuing. This work can, of course, only be carried out when there is a clear and unassailable legal basis for developing the Eurodac system.
Once again, I would like to thank you - even the honourable Members who have criticised the Commission - for the support expressed by various political groups for the Commission to manage and implement the Eurodac system.
We are prepared to take on this challenge, in the hope that the Council will listen to us.
Commissioner, before you leave the Chamber I invite you to come here so that I can take your fingerprints, perhaps, together with Mr Pirker.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment
The next item is the report (A5-0222/2000) by Mr Skinner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending for the second time Directive 89/655/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work (2nd individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 of Directive 89/391/EEC) (important text for the EEA) [COM(1998) 678 - C4-0707/1998 - 1998/0327(COD)]
Mr President, the first question to be asked about this report is: Why do we need this directive?
It is very interesting when you look at the statistics because the exact reasons become clear.
Almost 10% of all occupational accidents involve falls from heights.
One in ten of those involves permanent invalidity or death.
Across the European Union in any one year there are approximately half a million falls from heights in the workplace.
300 000 of those result in absences from the workplace of more than three days and 40 000 result in serious injury.
Unfortunately, 1 000 are fatal.
Many of these accidents - many of which can be avoided - come about because of the poor use of scaffolding or ladders.
In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, the body looking at accidents in the workplace has estimated that some 30% of all prohibition notices in the United Kingdom are issued for unsafe scaffolding alone.
In fact, 90% of all accidents on ladders come about because of the misuse of ladders.
These are statistics gathered by industry groups and others and not because of equipment failure.
Figures published recently by the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao suggest enormous variations between Member States in the incidence of falls from heights.
Such variations suggest that health and safety levels are not the same for all workers across the European Union.
That is why we need to establish minimum requirements with a view to protecting workers from falls from heights.
The current cost, both in personal terms and those of the workers and families affected and in terms of economic costs to industry and the social and health protection systems, warrants legislation in this area.
Billions of pounds are spent caring for workers who have been injured or become ill.
This can largely be avoided.
The background to this proposal suggests additional reasons for having this legislation.
This is an amendment to an existing directive on the general minimum requirements for work equipment at work.
A proposal to include scaffolding in an earlier amendment to the directive was rejected by Parliament, thanks to many of my colleagues on the other side of the House.
The directive finally adopted covered only two specific types of work equipment: mobile equipment and equipment for lifting loads which are very important areas in their own right.
This directive will rectify this serious omission.
If we do not include falls from heights, the only certainty is that there will be more and the rate will increase.
If Parliament rejects this addition, then it must hold itself responsible for the consequences.
The Commission' s original intention was to present a proposal for a scaffolding directive.
However, because serious falls from heights do not occur only from scaffolding, the scope has been widened to include protection for workers from all manner of falls from heights.
Although falls from heights occur in circumstances where ladders and scaffolding are not present, the main focus of the proposal is on scaffolding, ladders and rope access, as you will see as you read.
The current rules in many Member States apply only to the building industry, so another important factor is that the scope is extended to other sectors.
Also it is important to stress as some seem mildly confused about this, that this proposal is based on Article 138, previously Article 118a, which laid down the minimum requirements for ensuring a better level of protection for workers health and safety.
We are not dealing with the construction, the concept or the design or work equipment, but with the risks to the health and safety of workers using the equipment.
It does seem to me that there are some people in this House who are a little bit dim in grasping that.
The importance of working at heights and having this directive is clear also.
Some have questioned the validity of this legislation and they are free to do so.
However, contrary to what has been suggested, this proposal does not merely suggest training people to use ladders, nor does it outlaw the use of ladders.
What it does is provide for safe use of ladders and other equipment.
I wonder whether the critics of this report have ever worked on construction sites as many of us have.
I wonder whether they would accept that there are many people who know exactly what this legislation can bring about.
Finally, concerning the amendments tabled, which I have only just seen today, I welcome Amendments Nos 22 and 25: Amendment No 22 as a second choice if Amendment No 5 falls and Amendment No 25 as a recital as it hits the tone of my report very well.
However, for consistency' s sake and with regard to the framework directive which is the basis of this whole legislative approach, I cannot accept the others at present.
Mr President, I feel obliged, and I would like to do so courteously, to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, on his sensitivity, his excellent report and his willingness to accept the proposals - which I believe are well put together - of the Group on whose behalf I have the honour of speaking.
All of this means that we have a text which enjoys broad consensus, and not only amongst the two main Groups, since this consensus has been forged through constant communication with social operators, entrepreneurs and workers, via the trade unions.
I believe that consensus is necessary in a field in which the safety, health, integrity and the very lives of workers are at stake.
Very recently I was going for a walk around my town, Vigo, in Galicia, in the north west of Spain, when I happened to see a large works sign.
The works involved the renovation of an old square in the town' s historic quarter, and the sign said: "This company respects the law.
It uses safety equipment and devices.
If you are not familiar with them, do not enter the site.
Inform us of any situation of risk.
Please help us to fulfil the legal obligations for protecting the safety and health of workers" .
I mention the contents of this works sign and the advice, legal requirements for third parties and those with an interest in the works, because I believe that it represents a summary of the requirements of a good policy on health at work.
A good policy on health at work must begin by being preventive and the idea of prevention must to a large extent include awareness, not only on the part of workers and employers, but also on the part of society as a whole.
Unfortunately, every day we hear news of accidents at work.
We know very well there is no such thing as zero risk, but we are also aware that society must not cease in its efforts to prevent risk being turned into accidents.
When an accident happens, the responsibility may perhaps fall to the employer, because they have still not been convinced that money spent on safety is an investment.
Or perhaps it may fall to the worker, because they ignore the risks, or because of a lack of caution, or because adequate measures or precautions have not been taken, mainly in activities such as construction, in which the temporary nature of works and of the sector itself - a bridging sector, between primary activity, mainly agricultural, and the industrial and service sectors - require even more precautionary measures.
Or it may perhaps fall to the administration itself through the insufficiency, and therefore ineffectiveness, of the inspection, advisory and control services responsible for informing, advising and, where necessary, penalising non-compliance with the employment legislation.
Health and safety at work, especially where the risk is very high, is the responsibility of society and of all the sectors concerned, and the whole of society must assume its fair share of responsibility and commitment.
The employer should consider money spent on safety at work as an investment.
The worker should take full precautions, demanding and arguing for the use of preventive and protective mechanisms, as well as the good practices of companies.
States and governments should amend the measures for the promotion of preventive actions, for the inspection of the measures to prevent accidents, and also for the replacement of the administrative and political methods for combating accidents at work.
The old model of penalties, which has shown itself to be insufficient and ineffective, should be replaced with a method providing stimulus and incentive, by intensifying action in all companies or activities with the highest number of accidents, and also by offering benefits and advantages to companies with the lowest number of accidents and the highest spending on prevention and awareness.
Furthermore, the Commission and the Council should set minimum conditions which may seem strict to some, but which will allow working conditions to be improved and the health and safety of workers to be protected, harmonising legislation in a market operating with the free movement of workers.
In this way, European citizens will see Europe as being closer to them, a Europe that addresses their problems, concerns and interests.
Mr President, I wish, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Skinner, for his efforts in moderating and reconciling the various interests so that Parliament can make a positive, consensual contribution to improving this excellent Commission proposal.
Negligence in work organisation, a lack of appropriate equipment for personal and collective safety, the low level of training and the high number of self-employed workers are the main causes of the high level of injuries and deaths in the workplace.
The risks inherent in the building industry are even greater when compared with other, similar sectors.
Over the last 50 years, business activity has increased apace, and immigrant workers and sub-contractors are used to a great extent.
Apart from the aspects that have already been mentioned, the problems of communication and organisation are getting worse, and there is a tendency for the safety of everyone on building sites to be neglected, and for responsibility to be watered down.
It can never be stated too strongly that all the directives relating to the health and safety of workers and particularly the definition of responsibility contained in Directive 89/655/EEC are in force. These state that the employer, the owner of the site, is responsible for any accidents that happen there, and also for preventing them.
The person responsible for the safety of the site is obliged to carry out a risk assessment and to ensure that checks on safety equipment used by everyone with access to the site, regardless of their job, employment status or length of service, have been carried out.
The risk assessment has been carried out at a snail' s pace in the European Union, and this second revision is a positive sign that we really want to support and encourage.
Even looking at the matter from a purely economic point of view, it is extremely worrying to note that in the European Union, in 1996, out of every 100 000 workers, 4 229 took more than three days' sick leave as a result of accidents in the workplace.
In that year, four million seven hundred thousand accidents took place.
Although fatal accidents have decreased by 13%, which is to some extent linked to Community action between 1994 and 1996, there were still 5 549 deaths in 1996.
It is estimated that the damage caused to the European economy in that year was around 146 million working days lost.
It is particularly relevant to the debate on the directive that I mentioned earlier that, although the construction industry does not have the highest number of accidents, it does have the greatest number of fatal accidents, comparable only with the road haulage sector.
Europe cannot at the same time consider itself to be the world' s leading social model and yet allow people to count for little and for their lives to be reduced to mere statistics.
Men, especially young men under the age of 25, are the main victims of accidents in the workplace, but the probability of death as a result of an accident increases with age and is highest for those between 55 and 64 years old. This probability is highest in smaller companies - with up to 50 employees - and for self-employed workers, for whom the accident rate stands at 73.1% of all accidents in the workplace.
This illustrates the need for measures to be adopted in professions with a high turnover of workers: measures which focus on young people' s qualifications, multidisciplinary solutions involving training and qualifications and the quality of SMEs in some sectors.
Since the famous survey conducted in 1907 in the United States, when identification, compulsory registration, cause of death, the employer' s age, the worker' s age, name, circumstances and the accident itself were studied to establish costs and duties enabling workers to be better protected...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, as a number of speakers have already mentioned, falls from heights are among the most serious categories of industrial accident and, by means of this report which is a stage in the elaboration of the directive on minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment, we are setting to work on doing something about the problem.
On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I should like to say that, overall, we regard the result as progress.
The main features of the rules we are proposing to introduce in this area seem to be clear and, at the same time, appear to take due account of the fact that businesses will have to be able to make the rules work in practice and on a day-to-day basis.
For we need to remember that, however commendable and laudable the purpose behind what we are adopting, the consequences will not necessarily always be as we hope, and our objective must therefore always be to formulate rules which are as simple and precise as possible and to ensure that there is room for the flexibility needed in the labour market.
I believe that our rapporteur, Peter Skinner, has striven to find this balance between the desire for clear rules and the need for flexibility and diversity. He deserves a lot of thanks for this, as well as for his method of working. aimed at building consensus.
However, I believe that it will also be important in the future to work on reducing the risk of accidents by acquiring greater knowledge of how such accidents happen.
How many accidents are we talking about?
When do they occur?
How do they happen?
What can we do to prevent them?
I believe that the work begun with the European Agency for Health and Safety in Bilbao will make a positive contribution to a reduction in the accident figures as we find the answers to these questions and use them constructively.
This is a proper path to go down: the authorities cooperating with the two sides of industry.
Mr President, Commissioner, the report before us has been commended by everyone as being useful and necessary.
It concerns the use of ladders, scaffolding and ropes, working at heights, and, from time to time, alongside dangerous drops.
The background to this report is, of course, the many accidents which have occurred in the past and the inadequacy of directives to date.
This is why it is useful and necessary to have this report, although it has been a long time coming.
However, all credit to Mr Skinner for finally managing to complete it.
Despite this, it is a problem report in a way, not because it is causing something to be done, but because the sector we are dealing with is extremely diverse.
It covers people working in the service sector, maintenance sector, painters, window cleaners, etc.
Working at heights is not always for long periods of time but often for short spells.
This means that the definitions we use should be specific rather than vague, and that the provisions we make should be enforceable, which is far from always being the case.
I have already indicated that some descriptions are vague, including those describing "short duration" and "low level of risk" , for example, whilst the assessing of risks involving only a couple of people has been over-regulated.
We have managed to discuss some of these instances within the committee and these sections have been deleted from the report, which has led to an improvement.
I welcome the progress made and we should be able to continue in the same vein.
Let us examine a number of aspects, such as scaffold bearing surfaces.
Needless to say, they should be securely fixed but it is not always possible to brace them against movement, as long as they do not slip.
Mobile scaffolds must be prevented from moving about, but this cannot always be legislated for sufficiently.
You cannot have red lights everywhere.
Portable ladders must be anchored down and be solid, but they must remain serviceable.
This is why we have proposed requesting split voting for a number of amendments. In this way, everyone will have the opportunity to propose improvements on the vulnerable sections of the directive.
Mr President, I think it outrageous that the problem of accidents due to falls at work can give rise to some much opposition and cannot be sorted out more quickly.
Yet, the rapporteur himself reminds us how urgent the matter is when he quotes a figure of 500 000 accidents per year in this sphere alone, leading to at least 40 000 cases of seriously injury and around a thousand deaths.
As the rapporteur is careful to point out, however, building firms are opposed to regulation of any kind and, as a result, the report carefully avoids implicating them.
Technical defects in scaffolding and other systems do cause accidents in the workplace, but the main cause is production rates, working hours and poor conditions.
The report asks for employers to make arrangements at least to limit the carnage, if not to put an end to it.
If emergency measures were to be agreed, forcing employers to make such arrangements, then I should immediately be all in favour of them. I doubt, however, if that would be possible, so respectful is this Parliament of employers' interests.
Meanwhile, capitalist exploitation continues to exact a heavy toll among tens of thousands of employees in terms of their health and, sometimes, their lives.
Mr President, we support and value Mr Skinner' s work, although we do feel that, given the premises and, above all, the implications of the issue, he could have been a little more incisive, in view, moreover, of the fact that eleven years have passed since the first directive on the subject was produced and of the shortcomings of its amending directive which entered into force five years ago.
Of course, we are aware of the greater or lesser sensitivity towards these issues shown in the positions adopted within this very Parliament and elsewhere, and of the concerns raised regarding legislation which is more stringent or would involve greater costs for businesses.
However, as the rapporteur points out, we must consider just how much a worker' s life and health is worth.
In effect, occupational accidents continue to be the scourge of the world of employment in all the countries of the European Union, although there is a higher incidence in certain sectors.
This can certainly be explained by the many factors which contribute in various ways to increasing or reducing the size of the phenomenon, but we are now faced with an indisputable cause of injury, which is present in all the Member States, and which is sadly responsible for as much as ten percent of all occupational accidents, namely falls from heights.
It must be said that the Economic and Social Committee' s opinion certainly laid out, clearly and precisely, not only the scale of the problem but also and above all the solutions to be adopted: Mr Skinner has not failed to build on this foundation, taking as a starting point the need to consolidate the relevant terminology used, to improve the way work is organised and to provide specific training and information for the workers involved.
It must also be pointed out, however, that the solution should nevertheless be implemented via the preparation and issuing of more precise, and more stringent guidelines on prevention by the Commission, making it possible, among other things, to overcome the problem of the fragmentation of responsibilities in this area and, at the same time, to provide, along with more binding controls, for a system of incentives, particularly where small- and medium-sized businesses are concerned, to ensure that occupational safety rules are implemented efficiently and effectively.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Skinner for his commendable report on this complex issue of health and safety requirements for the use of work equipment, and also for being willing to adopt important proposals put forward by the PPE-DE Group.
Mr Perez Alvarez has already gone into this.
I am not happy on every count.
A certain amount of amendment will be necessary prior to the second reading, but the PPE-DE Group is prepared to accept the report overall.
The report in its present form even takes account of objections raised by small- and medium-sized enterprises, and calls for experts to be involved, but, of course, only where the setting up of ladders and scaffolding equipment at the workplace is concerned.
As is surely the case with all legal texts at national - and at regional level for that matter - some of the phraseology might raise a smile, if you can call any of it a laughing matter that is.
The smile certainly drained from my face when I read the European-wide statistics on accidents in the workplace, and on hearing them just now.
I do not intend to go further into the facts and figures, as we have already heard a great deal on that score.
But there is one fundamental point I would like to make.
Safety measures are not the only things that cost.
Continued payment of wages, sick pay, invalidity, widows' and orphans' allowances are a drain on business and on the national economy.
This is how productive a moderate social policy is.
Preventive action is also better, cheaper and more humane than a social policy that deals with the consequences.
It is no good shutting the stable door when the horse has bolted; you need to make sure it is shut to start with.
'But what about subsidiarity?' , goes the common cry.
This principle is not meant to render Europe completely inert!
I like the definition provided in Quadragesimo anno the best: subsidiarity - gives right of way in cases of doubt to smaller living entities and to solutions reached by social partners, in the face of State, or - I might well add - EU rulings.
But if the smaller entity is unable to perform its tasks in the interests of the public good, then the larger entity must step in.
This explains why so many European minimum standards were laid down in the EU Treaties in the eighties, when Christian Democrats and Conservatives had the monopoly on power in Europe; in other words, it is a Christian Democrat affair.
Incidentally, health and safety regulations have been organised at international level since the industrial revolution in the 19th century.
The great Conservative British statesman Benjamin Disraeli was one of the pioneers of health and safety regulations.
Continental Europe took its cue from England, adopted these laws and also enshrined them in international conventions, doing so from the very outset.
In view of globalisation and Europeanisation, there is without doubt a need for the European social dimension in the 21st century.
We want to Europeanise the economy.
We have the single currency.
It cannot be the answer to deal with social policy at a purely regional, or even provincial, level.
Minimum standards mean subsidiarity.
Each country can frame its own health and safety regulations provided that European minimum standards are observed.
We PPE-DE Group Members are opposed to European maximum standards.
In Germany the picture is completed by legal acts introduced by the social partners.
There are German standards and health and safety regulations for the workplace.
We also have statutes such as legal acts governing professional trade associations, not to mention the accident prevention law.
Incidentally, it is all very well for people to be critical - for stylistic reasons among others - of the fact that we have a whole host of detailed regulations.
I tell you this though; a fraction of these practical regulations would do the citizens and workers of the Member States a greater service than reams and reams of fancy talk and great ideologies.
Mr President, as the rapporteur' s fine report points out, the figures recently published by the European Agency for Health and Safety at Work, whose headquarters are in Bilbao, indicate very differing results in relation to work accidents between the various Member States, owing to the fact that the States are not applying uniform statistical criteria.
It is therefore urgent that we establish harmonised standards at Community level so that we can have comparable data and assess the results of preventive policies in each European State, community or region. We must do this to ensure that we do not have first- or second-class workers, or lower, but that all workers are protected by safety regulations and requirements of the same quality.
It is also the case that we need more site inspectors so that companies will sufficiently respect the regulations, but it is just as true that the public institutions and companies must begin by setting an example in all of this. Nevertheless, even today, many activities and workplaces of public bodies do not have the required plans for prevention of work-related risk that are laid down in Community directives.
I would therefore like to call on all the European public managers to make an effort to be the first to comply with the regulations, so that managers in the private sector cannot use institutional laziness as an excuse.
The Commission has proposed an amended directive on health and safety at work.
This report suggests it should be longer and more detailed.
UK Conservatives believe that we should vote against it for that very reason.
This is not a question of whether or not health and safety at work is an important issue.
Of course it is.
It is not a question of whether or not the recommendations in the report are sound.
Many of them are and Peter Skinner has put a lot of thought into his work.
It is a question of how the European Parliament should be spending its time and be seen to be spending its time.
It is a question of what Parliament should be looking at as its priorities.
It is a question of whether it should be for the Commission and for the European Parliament to prescribe the fine detail of people' s working and waking lives.
There is a problem in the UK, but not confined to the UK.
The EU is seen to be interfering.
The European Parliament is often seen to be interfering even more.
It is not seen as focusing on the big issues.
Our constituents ask us why they should vote for anybody at the European elections.
They ask: what are you doing for us?
What shall we answer?
We have the opportunity to tell our people that we do care about the big issues that they care about, that we can help deliver a better peace, security, prosperity, environment and quality of life - issues that can genuinely be helped best at a European level.
Or we can answer that the EU, through the Commission and Parliament, is about deciding whether or not it should be legal for one person to stand at the bottom of a ladder holding on to it while another person climbs up it.
This is the issue that we are discussing today.
Let us oppose this latest example of red tape from the top.
At some time or other, Parliament must give a clear signal as to its true sense of purpose, its true priorities.
I say: Let it be now.
I am very grateful to be able to follow my colleague, Philip Bushill-Matthews, because I share many of the concerns he has expressed.
I think that this proposal reflects no credit on the European Union or on this House.
I think if the European Union - and indeed if the European Parliament - wishes to be taken seriously by the people of Europe then this is exactly the sort of legislation which it should cease to enact because we all know that health and safety and workers' safety is a priority for all Member States, and so it should be.
But there is no justification for a Europe-wide standard on this issue.
There can be no reason why Member States, acting in a uniform way, would necessarily be able to tackle this problem more effectively than individual Member States and, above all, there can be no reason for taking such a close interest in ordinary aspects of people' s working lives.
It can make no sense to legislate on how Europeans are permitted to climb ladders.
This should not be the priority for this House.
It is too great a level of detail for this House to involve itself in and it will merely lead to the ridiculing of the European Union because this is just the sort of interference which is deeply unpopular with many citizens across the European Union.
Instead of engaging in this sort of interference, we should be addressing those issues where it is constructive for Member States to work together and develop some common standards.
A common and uniform and centralised standard on how you climb a ladder is not necessary and it is an undesirable interference with the way people run their work environment.
We can trust the people of Europe to decide for themselves how they climb ladders.
I believe that it is not necessary to conduct a risk assessment every time it is proposed to use a ladder.
As anyone working in the home can tell you, ladders are used very commonly and very frequently and, yes, there are accidents but I do not believe this kind of directive will ever eliminate those accidents.
All it will do is add yet another layer of European bureaucracy and red tape to be dealt with by a business community already suffocated by the weight of red tape.
As my colleague has said, it is time for a change.
It is time for this Parliament to start addressing the issues which are of concern to the citizens of Europe and to stop addressing itself to detailed questions where it can be of no assistance in actually securing worker protection.
In fact, all it is doing is bringing itself and the European Union into disrepute and burdening European businesses with a layer of cost and bureaucracy that they can ill afford.
I have to express amazement at the two speeches we have just heard, one from Mr Bushill-Matthews and the other from Mrs Villiers.
They seem to be engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy.
They deplore the fact that the European Parliament is regarded as involving itself in trivia and generating red tape and yet they spend their time issuing press releases describing very important pieces of health and safety legislation as nothing but trivia and red tape.
It is hardly surprising that the British media project the sort of image that they describe.
This is a very important piece of health and safety legislation, building upon the corpus of such legislation that we have adopted at European level over the last twenty years.
It is not trivial for the families of the 500 000 people who fall from heights at work every year.
300 000 of those accidents are serious enough to cause the employees to be absent from work more than three days.
40 000 of those falls are very serious and 1 000 result in deaths.
Try to explain to the families concerned that this is a trivial issue.
It is not.
It is a very important issue and survey after survey, including those in Eurobarometer, and surveys of SMEs including by the last British Government have shown that SMEs themselves recognise the importance of good health and safety legislation.
I deplore the fact that the consensus we have had in this important area of policy has been broken in this way by a small minority in the EPP.
It really is absolutely deplorable and we should all - right across the political spectrum - make it clear that we will not tolerate that sort of behaviour from that minority.
It is described as bureaucratic.
But read the directive itself, read the proposal.
Is it onerous?
Is it burdensome?
Does it require detailed voluminous risk assessments before work is carried out a height?
No, it does not, it is a very easily understood, readable, implementable directive and it should be described in that way.
It should be described as making a valuable contribution to preventing injury and deaths within the European Union.
Please do not engage in this trivialisation and then come along here and hypocritically express surprise that this institution is being held in ridicule.
You are the people who are causing that.
Stop it now, please.
Mr President, first of all I would like to say that my delegation intends to back the Skinner report on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending for the second time the Directive concerning minimum health and safety requirements.
The key issue of health and safety protection for workers is a matter of concern to us all.
No one is prepared to expose themselves to the accusation that they are anti-social, and it is undoubtedly justifiable to have minimum regulations in the European area.
It also accords with the EU Treaty, and so we will give the rapporteur the respect due to him.
But I am at a loss as to why MEPs manoeuvre themselves time and again into predicaments where they either face the accusation of being of an anti-social disposition, or else risk becoming a laughing stock.
I certainly cannot see why mature adults should be dictated to on how they should climb ladders, or get down them, or why a risk assessment should have to be completed before a ladder is used; or why there should be an instruction to the effect that, two people should not climb a ladder at the same time, if at all possible, or even one stating that time spent up a ladder should not exceed half an hour, or - a peculiar refinement - 25% of total working hours.
The Skinner report will go down in parliamentary lore as 'the ladder report' , and the people of the European Union will justifiably ask themselves whether we do not have anything better to do than produce legislation on things they take for granted, which should in fact be a matter for in-house experts and have no place either in an EU directive or an associated report produced by the codecision-making Parliament!
In fact this is not the first time that a report with a social component has contained such absurdities.
When MEPs have to rack their brains over matters such as the physical constitution of Europeans, in order to establish standards for the average size of tractor seat, or the conditions under which panicled tomatoes - the Austrian word is Rispenparadeiser - can enter the market, this shows an MEP' s job description, but also the raison d' Ãªtre of the European institutions, in a poor light, to say nothing of the fact that such detailed provisions and over-regulation can become counter-productive.
The same applies to national legislation on protection for workers, incidentally.
Despite all the financial incentives, protective measures of this kind are apt to deter employers from taking on apprentices, thereby contributing to youth unemployment rather than helping to alleviate it.
In addition, however, the Skinner report raises the fundamental question as to what Europe should do and what it should not do.
In other words, it is about competences and the judicious application of the subsidiarity principle.
We cannot, and must not, evade the issue any longer.
This is not just because of the Intergovernmental Conference and the organisational form of the European Union, which must find a satisfactory solution in view of the forthcoming enlargement.
This issue has to do with the acceptance of the Union by the people, which is the subject of much complaint.
We need more Europe where internal and external security is concerned, more Europe when it comes to looking after our interests in the global competition, in currency policy and in the completion of the single market.
But what we do not need is a Europe that makes inroads on the autonomy of governments, regional administrative bodies, and lastly, the individual, and which takes away the individual' s right to an opinion.
I therefore intend to use this report as an opportunity to highlight the demand for a debate on competences after the Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, let us be absolutely clear about the fact that there is no one in this Parliament who wants anything other than the best.
Let us make it clear that no one in this Parliament wants anything other than that the number of accidents, especially fatal accidents, should fall in all workplaces around our splendid continent and in our Member States.
Let us, however, at the same time make it absolutely clear to one other - and I am addressing a number of speakers here - that different answers can be arrived at to the question of what is the correct level of political decision-making at which to make these important decisions.
After listening to Mr Hughes, to the British Labour Government and also to others in Britain, I am extremely confident that they are deeply committed to finding answers to these questions.
After listening to Mr Menrad, I am very confident that the German Christian Democratic Party is thoroughly engaged with these issues in Germany.
I can guarantee that all seven parliamentary parties in Sweden, especially my own Christian Democratic Party, are concerned about the matter.
I can also assure you that public opinion and the trade unions are very committed to the issue and want to enact laws which will lead to a very significant reduction in the number of deaths due to industrial accidents.
What is it, then, which leads us to believe that it is at the level of the European Parliament, representing countries with more than 15 national parliaments, that the right forum for decision-making is to be found?
In the light of the subsidiarity or proximity principle, allow me to express my doubts about the extent to which this issue is suited to being dealt with specifically in the European Parliament.
Amendment 14, paragraph 4.2.2, for example, reads as follows: 'Before portable ladders are brought into service, their feet shall be prevented from slipping by securing the stiles at or near their upper or lower ends, by any anti-slip device or by any other arrangement of equivalent effectiveness.
As a priority, ladders should be secured firmly using all possible means.
Ladders used for access should be long enough for their uprights to protrude sufficiently beyond the access platform.
Ladders in several sections shall be so used as to ensure that they are secure.
The holding of the ladder by another person as a safety measure shall not be allowed.'
This text is well meant and perfectly in order legally.
I can absolutely assure you that, at home in Mora in Dalarna, where I live, as well as in the Swedish Parliament and also in all other national parliaments, these matters are being carefully looked into.
In view of the subsidiarity principle in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, is it right of the European Parliament to legislate at this very high level of detail?
Instead what we ought to be doing is aiming for a directive which specifies our objectives.
In that way, we can allow the Member States themselves, their people and their elected representatives in national parliaments and governments to be responsible for the existence of regulations ensuring that working life does not involve unnecessary risks.
Allow them to determine how to frame the rules so as to fulfil the requirements of the directive in the best way.
National legislation is being enacted in this area to add to the existing national laws.
The two sides of industry are also extremely active in this area.
We Swedish Christian Democrats shall be voting against this report on the basis of the subsidiarity principle.
I should like to congratulate Mr Skinner for skilfully managing to formulate a series of compromises which strike a good balance between the different interests involved.
This has led to a document that has clearly won considerable approval, which is quite an achievement on this very important political issue.
This text is a good answer to Mr Bushill-Matthews' voters and what Europe does for them.
It is something concrete and it concerns people is every day lives.
Using the enterprises' language, I should like to say that this directive is based not only on social solidarity and social justice, but on competition issues as well.
That is why we try to help applicant countries to develop and implement health and safety policies.
These health and safety policies are the Commission' s first priority in the social agenda.
Apart from undertaking the specific commitments set out in this agenda, we are starting to prepare a communication on health and safety and future strategies for health and safety.
The European Parliament has many new ideas and we expect your contribution to this communication.
If we turn to the current text, this is the second amendment of Directive 89/655 EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for work equipment.
It aims to prevent falls from heights by setting minimum requirements for the use of the relevant work equipment such as ladders and scaffolding.
Falls from heights account for more than 10% of occupational accidents and one in ten of such falls results in permanent invalidity or death.
This is a particularly serious problem, which is costly for business and society and which, more importantly, causes suffering and human tragedy for the people directly involved and their families.
The current proposal is a very important step towards doing something concrete about this.
I welcome your broad support.
It is obvious it is something more than bureaucracy.
Since my reply must deal with the technical details because of the rules of this procedure, I have to stick to the written text.
On your amendments and the ideas behind the amendments, we are happy to accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 15, 20 and 22 as they stand.
On the text of Amendments Nos 10, 13, 14, 18, the Commission agrees with the principles behind the changes proposed and can agree with most of the texts put forward.
However, we do propose a few changes or additions, mainly to be sure that we take account of all possible situations and do not create any unintended holes in the safety net we intend to provide with this initiative.
On Amendment No 10, we agree with the inclusion of a reference to a prior risk assessment, but would prefer different wording in order to specify the circumstances for the use of ladders.
Similarly, on Amendment No 13 we share the desire to ensure that there is no implied obligation to use mobile platforms, but we believe that this is best achieved by the original wording with the possible addition of the phrase "of adequate dimensions" .
Also, Amendment No 14 will improve the directive, but in order to avoid any risk of a different interpretation in the future, we would prefer a slight change to the wording, which would include retaining the requirement to prevent the sections of a multi-section ladder from moving relative to each other.
This is because even slight sudden movements that do not threaten the security of the ladder may cause the worker to lose balance and fall.
We agree with the main idea behind Amendment No 18 and the references to the securing of the decks and the prevention of unintentional movement.
However, we must oppose the reference to "load-bearing surfaces" as they will cause confusion over what is meant by "deck" .
We also must oppose the reference to planks forming the scaffold deck as this implies that scaffolding systems that use prefabricated boards are not covered.
Likewise Amendments Nos 16 and 19 need only slight modification to avoid difficulties in interpretation later on.
Finally, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 21, 23, 24, 25 and 26.
This is not a question of a political disagreement but simply that Amendments Nos 6 and 7 change accepted standard texts while the other amendments repeat what is stated elsewhere.
We must endeavour to keep Community legislation as straightforward as possible and avoid any inconsistencies in the overall framework.
This is especially important in the field of health and safety where businesses sometimes have in implementing rules because of their complexities.
With regard to Amendment No 1, the issue is already covered by the text.
In the same way, the definition of "collective fall protection safeguards" given in Amendment No 8 is not necessary.
These safeguards have already been mentioned in the basic directive and there is no risk of confusion.
Also Amendment No 21 is unnecessary as this area is already covered by Directive 92/57/EEC and it refers to a specific paragraph.
Here again, if we repeat something that has already been defined, it is a potential for conflicting interpretations.
Amendment No 5 is covered by Amendment No 22, which is accepted as it stands.
Amendment No 6 covers training, which is already incorporated in Recital 7, and research, which is beyond the scope of this directive.
Furthermore, Recital 7 uses a standard form of words.
There are thus several reasons for not accepting Amendment No 6.
Amendment No 7 advocates a change in Article 2(3).
This is established standard wording and the Commission therefore cannot accept a change to it.
Amendment No 23 cannot be supported by the Commission as the issue of health and safety committees in enterprises has been appropriately addressed in the framework directive and according to it, detailed regulation is a matter of subsidiarity for all Member States.
Amendments Nos 24 and 25 must be rejected because training is already adequately covered, especially following Amendments Nos 16, 19 and 22.
In spite of its simplicity, the Commission cannot support Amendment No 26 as we prefer to specify the circumstances for the use of ladders.
To sum up, I am happy that we agree on all main issues and our differences lie in a few technical points.
I repeat my appreciation of your extensive work and it will improve the protection of workers in this field.
We will improve the protection we intend to provide with this initiative.
Mr President, I am glad to see the tradition of speaking to the Commissioner is still alive and well.
I am particularly pleased with the comments she has made.
I hope that Parliament' s amendments will be adopted tomorrow as I am sure they will be, despite the elements in this Parliament which do not seem to want to join in and that we will have an interesting discussion with the Council.
I wonder if the Commissioner would join me in deploring the way in which this report has been treated, with parts - notably the ladders - being isolated and suggestions made - by Mr Bushill-Matthews for one - that this is something that is futile if not childish.
Commissioner, I hope you will agree that this is a Treaty obligation for us all to look at.
The basis is Article 138, which was previously Article 118a - and if I am right, we must look into the costs - administrative and otherwise - for small-to-medium-sized businesses, as laid down in the Treaty already.
This is a small-to-medium-sized-business-friendly piece of legislation, but more importantly it is friendly to the workers who have to use this equipment.
That is why the legislation is there and is to be applied across the European Union.
If only Mr Bushill-Matthews had been here when I first started, he would have heard some of the arguments which I wish to place before this House as to why it is important to have EU legislation.
It is a great problem when you do not hear the arguments, but you merely come in with your own loaded thoughts.
Indeed, it is a great shame, and I hope that Mrs Villiers will come back some time and perhaps pay a visit to our committee so she can hear some of the debate about this report as well - because I noticed that she disappeared soon after she made her point - maybe we will read about that in the papers as well.
Finally, I would like to say to Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is here, that the journalist on the Daily Mail, to which you sent your press releases on this report, rang me back and asked me about a specific amendment that contained your phraseology and your words, which he said was the nonsense part of this whole directive.
Perhaps you can correct him instead of correcting us.
The debate is closed.
