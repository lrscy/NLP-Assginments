And I think that the main issue is precisely this process and this road.
Because I do not think, Mr Verheugen, that we can all agree to vote for parliaments, to vote for governments, on the one hand, and yet still have military rule dictating political terms on behalf of us all on the other.
From this viewpoint, the Morillon proposal is an encouraging prospect.
We, as Greeks, want Turkey in the European Union, we want a democratic Turkey, because a democratic Turkey will be the beginning of the end of crises in the region as a whole, crises which we have lived with for many, many years and from which none of us has profited.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Morillon, most sincerely for his most thorough report.
I am glad that we have been able to achieve far-reaching agreement.
I am also pleased that Parliament has responded very quickly to the common position unanimously adopted in the Council. Above all, I am glad that Parliament is able to accept far and away the greater part of this position, as proposed by the Commission.
The report now proposes adding three points to the draft regulation.
I am able to tell you that the Commission shares Parliament' s view on these points.
The Commission will therefore examine the relevant amendments proposed by the European Parliament, inform the Council as soon as possible of its position and ask it to conclude the legislative procedure.
A special importance attaches to this draft regulation for it constitutes the last of the three pillars of financial aid for Turkey, the others being the measures in favour of Turkey in the framework of the MEDA programme and the regulation issued by the Council in April.
All these financial resources are designed to support implementation of the pre-accession strategy.
The purpose of the strategy is to equip Turkey for entering into negotiations.
That will only come about when basic political, economic and social reforms have been implemented.
Improvements in relations between the Union and Turkey following the European Council, meeting in Helsinki, have enabled us to speak openly and frankly with each other on all issues.
The strengthened political dialogue at all levels characteristic of the climate following Helsinki has made a decisive contribution to this state of affairs.
I also have to say that open and frank discussions which sometimes address painful themes and touch upon sensitive issues are indispensable if we want to travel all the way down the path which lies before us.
I should like to take the opportunity to re-emphasise that we await a firm commitment on the part of Turkey to continuing with the process of reform that has been begun.
A few weeks ago, Turkey signed both UN conventions on civil and political rights and on economic and social rights.
I believe that this is of a piece with the decision we made last year and may be regarded as a successful outcome.
I welcome Turkey' s signature of these documents as an important step in the right direction.
However, I should also like to emphasise that it is now a question of both conventions quickly being ratified by the Turkish Parliament and of the commitments contained in these also being put into practice.
On my last visit to Turkey in July, I was informed in detail of an inter-ministerial commission' s report, then before the government, on the reforms needed if the Copenhagen criteria are to be fulfilled.
The report contains a host of proposed reforms for improving the human rights situation.
However, it is now a question of the Turkish Government' s putting the proposed reforms into effect within the framework of a consistent legislative programme.
I also expressly insisted upon this in the course of the discussions in Turkey.
As you know, the European Council, meeting in Helsinki, has confirmed that it is essential for Turkey firstly to comply with the political accession criteria if its relations with the European Union are to become any closer.
This will also be the theme in preparing the Accession Partnership which the Commission is to submit in the autumn of this year on the instructions of the Council.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Community audiovisual policy in the digital age
The next item is the report (A5-0209/2000) by Mr Veltroni, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Principles and guidelines for the Community's audiovisual policy in the digital age [COM(1999)657 - C5-0144/2000 - 2000/2087(COS)]
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the document on the Community's audiovisual policy in the digital age, presented by the Commission, is important because this technological innovation has, to a certain extent, a direct bearing on our cultural future and therefore on sensitive issues such as pluralism and the quality of democracy in our continent.
The digital age and convergence of media will change everything: our way of gaining knowledge, communicating, working, producing and understanding.
There are risks - as there always are when innovation bursts forth - but the transition to digital technology will bring with it huge opportunities for pluralism and massive production possibilities for the system.
It is no coincidence that the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, proposed a few days ago to put digital television frequencies up for auction in order to speed up the process, revolutionising the prospects of the conventional management of the electromagnetic spectrum.
And it is also no coincidence that Mr Blair also proposed free distribution of set top boxes, perceiving that this would benefit both the economy and the information and cultural pluralism of his country.
Changes in technology bring changing perspectives and therefore changes in legal approaches as well.
The Community therefore has to keep up with progress and endeavour to ensure that digital technology fulfils its potential as an opportunity for culture, pluralism, cultural and linguistic diversity and for the European economy and technical innovation and research in Europe.
We consider that the instruments which have already been defined in the Commission's text will make it possible to achieve these goals.
However, the debate generated in Parliament, which has looked at different points of view and has pulled out all the stops, as did the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, in order to find a common point of agreement with the result that the report was adopted unanimously, proposes a limited number of nevertheless important supplements.
Firstly: the need for a rapid revision of the legal instruments governing the sector, in particular the "Television without Frontiers" Directive which has been in need of revision for a long time.
Secondly: in order to avert the risk of dependency of our cultural industry in the event of expansion, of growth of the number of channels, we would like to introduce the possibility of production investment in the audiovisual sector.
It is vital for the media to be financed but I feel that, following the example of certain countries, we should also provide for the television broadcasting companies themselves to set aside funds, dedicating a proportion of their revenue to the production of European programmes. I consider that this is a useful, important action for it both supports the industry and acts as an incentive for it.
Thirdly, monitoring the concentration of media ownership, in the future maybe on the basis of specific regulations at European level safeguarding pluralism, taking up once again the idea of a media directive and a body which would monitor at European level the application of the rules in this sensitive sector; in addition, a policy which, in the age of convergence, would also safeguard a universal service with regard to access to content, which is taken to mean non-discrimination and affordable access to services.
As the importance of the role of the public broadcasting service in the digital system is recognised, the service will, of course, have to be reviewed and revamped in the light of changes in technology, but it will also have to perform the function of guaranteeing the quality of services to a large public, which will continue for a long time to use its common or garden television sets and wireless reception on a daily basis; therefore, strategic recognition of the role of land-based digital television, whose growth can only be considered to be an opportunity here as well.
Finally, the report proposes a supplement to ensure that particular attention is paid to safeguarding cultural diversity, international negotiations and the need to consolidate the European audiovisual industry to make it competitive on the global market.
This is therefore the spirit of the report and its attempt to operate within the bounds proposed by the Commission's report.
The TDI Group has tabled amendments characterised by a different vision, a different legitimate cultural and political inspiration.
My opinion is that, if these amendments were to be adopted, the report would then be devoid of those characteristics which prompted agreement in the Committee, the very characteristics which are our basis for considering that the report could be a positive supplement to the Commission's report.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mr Tajani, as a member of the same delegation and the same committee, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the Commission on the complicated content of its initiative, but we must not let go of the importance of regulating the audiovisual policy in the age of high technology in which we live and which will become more and more important for our lives in the near future.
Due to the complexity of the material and the short time available to me, I will restrict myself to a few recapitulatory statements which I consider essential and which I hope the Commission will take into due consideration.
The free movement of information and freedom of expression serve now to safeguard rights and freedoms and will always do so.
The citizens' confidence in the audiovisual service must be won through compliance with the principles of the protection of human dignity and of minors.
The area in question, which is constantly developing, is in need of detailed rules, but they must not be too rigid or they will rapidly become obsolete.
Technology and content cannot be governed by the same legislation: technology must be neutral and content must be regulated.
The system of funding must comply with the principles of proportionality and transparency and must not influence the market or competition.
Where a commercial activity is associated with a public service, the keeping of separate accounts will make the compensation for the service rendered transparent, making it possible to prevent any disguised State aid and to allow private firms to provide the public service as well.
No national restriction must be placed on transposition, in order to achieve genuine European harmonisation, both now and in the event of future growth.
Including self-regulation codes in the legislative framework will ensure transparency, responsibility and the equal status of public and commercial operators.
Clearly, in the context of new technologies, a situation where State subsidies to public service broadcasters are used for commercial ends must be avoided, as this would distort the principle of competitiveness with private companies instead of ensuring compliance with specific content obligations.
Lastly, we must guarantee multiplicity and pluralism of bids and provide all operators with the possibility of playing an innovative and leading role, thus liberalising access to public financing.
Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Veltroni.
As rapporteur, he has done some very good work, including work of a very cooperative nature, and I should like to thank him very much for that.
However, thanks are similarly due to the Commission which has provided an outstanding basis for the discussions between the Committee and Parliament.
The audiovisual sector basically faces the task of having to develop in two main fields.
Firstly, it is a means of generating future jobs. Secondly, however, it is also of great significance for securing cultural diversity and freedom of speech in Europe.
It is therefore important always to keep both perspectives in view.
I should like briefly to illustrate this by way of three examples.
Firstly, it is necessary to regulate content and methods of transmission differently and independently of each other.
We need a form of technology which can respond very quickly and very flexibly to the technological revolution.
I would just mention the buzz word 'Internet' at this point.
However, we not only wish to guarantee people universal access to all networks but also need to ensure that young people are protected and human dignity assured by means of legal regulations which, independently of the method of transmission, safeguard these values that are indispensable to us all.
Secondly, consider the level at which decisions are made.
Where the issue of technology is concerned, we need increasing cooperation among the Member States at European level.
When it comes to issues of content, however, we want to know that, in the first place, the Member States are willing and able to safeguard cultural pluralism and diversity of opinion.
Thirdly, television in Europe.
We have both commercial and public service broadcasting which both require clear statutory frameworks in order to be able to develop in competition.
We therefore say a clear yes to the protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam on public service broadcasting and to the Member States' responsibility for commissioning and for securing finance.
We are also, however, saying just as clear a yes to the task of developing and promoting commercial television companies in Europe so that they can compete effectively worldwide.
That is the crucial precondition for safeguarding European cultural content, with the conditions of future technology in mind.
Thank you very much to Mr Veltroni for giving us such a valuable report.
It is a welcome clarification on where Parliament stands on digital and audiovisual sector issues for the forthcoming revision of TV without frontiers.
However, I want to confine my remarks this evening to public service broadcasting in the digital age because there are some very important public access issues that we need to address when defining the principles from the crossover in our current media to the development of digital broadcasting.
Defining the values and principles underlying public broadcasting gives us some difficulties anyway, as Member States, corporations, and broadcasters all have very different ideas of what public broadcasting constitutes.
However, this should not prevent us from defining it in the digital age, because these principles are very important to us all, and, as infrastructure has developed, so content is going to develop as well.
We are all being told that we are entering a knowledge-based society, and if that is the case, then knowledge in a sense becomes power that defines the powerless and the powerful, the information poor and the information rich.
Overcoming that divide, to my mind, should be one of the key points that we emphasise in this report.
There are a number of reasons why this is important to us from the perspective of European content.
First of all, if we are in a knowledge-based society, we need growth in knowledge-based and creative skills.
Secondly, we are a democratic society, and digital policy in the audiovisual sector can connect our local citizens to our citizens at the centres of power.
In terms of cultural richness and diversity, it is important both that we should have individual centres of cultural excellence and that we be bound as a European continent.
And, finally, we have to ensure that the switchover from analogue to digital is attractive to all of our citizens: that is the end which we should work to achieve.
Mr President, Commissioner, the airwaves are buzzing.
You cannot open a newspaper or put the radio or television on without being confronted by new developments in the IT or digitalisation sectors.
Things are happening fast, in fact they are happening at the speed of light, which is why my group is delighted with the communication from the Commission and with Mr Veltroni' s exhaustive report, which looks into every aspect of these new developments.
As the rapporteur rightly points out, the AV sector is an extremely important sector in terms of employment, but also in terms of freedom of expression, democracy and cultural diversity in Europe.
But as far as the Liberal Group is concerned, that does not mean that Europe should set about regulating absolutely everything.
This would not be possible, and nor would it be desirable.
It is a self-aware sector and is perfectly capable of standing on its own two feet.
As the Liberals see it, for one thing this means that there is no need for yet another additional subsidy over and above Media Plus for the European film industry.
Complementary measures and cooperation with the business community, and fiscal measures, these are the key words of a more effective policy intended to increase the financial resources and to improve the marketing and distribution.
That is why we have requested split voting for Recital N. Nor are we in favour of quotas.
The TV operators must decide for themselves, on the basis of quality, what programmes they want to show.
It is not Europe' s business to regulate this, so no artificial protection.
The industry in Europe is more than capable of making interesting and quality productions that will attract viewers.
As I have already said, it is only the marketing and distribution that need to be improved.
On a final note: we attach a great deal of importance to the freedom of the user and therefore the same applies to parents.
They have the right and the responsibility to decide for themselves what is suitable for their children.
So we do not need complex censorship and filtering systems in programmes.
It is often very doubtful as to where the boundary lies.
And we certainly do not want a legal framework, where the powers that be set the rules.
My group will vote accordingly.
Mr President, first and foremost, I must apologise on behalf of my colleague Mrs Echerer, who felt unwell and has gone to see the doctor.
So if I go over my allotted time slightly, I would like to pick up some of her speaking time.
Needless to say, I can only congratulate Mr Veltroni on his first-rate report, which, as someone has just said, has come at a good time.
In the past, as well as the present, Europe has taken a fairly progressive stance on the telecommunications front, when it comes to a European single market, and we are none the worse for that.
I believe it is high time for us to take a look at the content side of things, because, unfortunately, Europe is still lagging behind a little in this respect.
It is a marvellous idea to create a whole network that responds to the requirements of convergence, and which enables the public to receive information via a GSM, a computer or a television, but we must also be aware of what sort of information it is and, above all - and I am also thinking about what may be of positive value to our audiovisual industry - we must beware of being inundated by American products alone.
After all, the fact is that our European cinema, as I have said on other occasions, is light years behind, and we cannot allow this situation to continue indefinitely, particularly in the light of the history of European cinema.
I am not calling for quotas.
I am calling for a European investment fund to be set up, which will enable the creative producers we have in Europe to at long last enter into real competition with America, in a manner which fully meets with the requirements of the free market.
No, this is not regulation, it would simply be a means of enabling creative producers to get down to work in Europe, and a way of avoiding seeing all the talent, intelligence and capital - for this is the new trend - disappearing over to Hollywood.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether she does not think that the time has come to work on a new directive for the cinema. Is it not time - since this is one of the distinguishing features of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which I belong to, - for us all to sit down together one day and consider how we are going to rescue the European film industry?
And I repeat, this is not a petition for rules and regulations, this is taking a long, hard look at how films are made, for there is no mystery about it. Films cannot be made without a major injection of capital, and that is where we fall down in Europe.
I believe this presents a unique opportunity for the European Investment Bank.
Mr President, the Commission has set itself the short-term task of defining what a European audiovisual work is.
I am very interested by this definition, which naturally complements today's discussion.
The effect of the "Television without Frontiers" Directive has been that a large percentage of national works are still broadcast in each country, without managing to have these works circulated between countries.
The aim of defining European audiovisual works must therefore be to achieve the circulation of these works.
In this context, we agree that the cultural diversity that is advocated today is not a simple addition of the respective identities of each Member State, but the exchange and circulation of these identities.
However, the circulation of works, like the origin of their funding, will probably be insufficient to define the European audiovisual work.
The issue of the work' s content concerns us all.
What content can define a work, if it is not content founded on a pluralist approach to production?
Partnerships are necessary for current and future audiovisual creation, but hegemonic strategies and monopolies are counter to creation itself.
There is nothing more dangerous than the current concentrations of operators who have both the broadcasting capacity as well as archives of material.
At a time of digital revolution and technological change, Mr Veltroni's excellent report clearly shows the economic and cultural need for a European audiovisual policy.
I would like to end by emphasising the essential points of this report.
What could protect diversity and pluralism better than a "universal service" ?
What would ensure free access to information, entertainment and knowledge?
Public television is not a monopoly and should not be one.
One of the goals of the public service, however, is the general interest, and for this reason it must be valued.
Public television channels are developing autonomously in each Member State, pursuant to Protocol 32 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but they are agreed on taking on similar tasks, such as information, innovation, room for exchange and integration etc.
All that remains is to make their funding transparent, not so much to conform to rules on competition as to enable public service to really diversify its activities and enrich its services.
To put it plainly, not to die off in the digital age, but to perpetuate the accomplishment of its goals which should, it seems to me, constitute guidelines for the Community audiovisual policy.
Mr President, I would like to start by complimenting the rapporteur on managing to combine so many proposals in one report.
However, I would like to touch on a few points.
In the first place, I agree that there is a need for policy-makers and the law to be able, or rather to be as good as under obligation, to adapt to the speed of technological progress.
In the case of the audiovisual sector, clear and, most importantly, timely legal instruments will mean that the institutions are able to regulate these changes: to provide better protection for the public and for users, establish the necessary restrictions to protect minors, lay down new rules to protect copyright and set regulations in place before certain developments occur, such as the fact that electronic commerce will soon be taking place via the medium of television.
Moreover, we must not be intimidated but take pride in the entire audiovisual sector in the digital age as a great vehicle of freedom, information and movement of ideas.
We have a vast European heritage of culture and communications which must be fully exploited, and for this more funding will certainly be necessary, but this purpose could also be served by opportunities for discussion, such as the Forum proposed by the rapporteur: this would be an opportunity for discussion aimed at the creation of a future audiovisual policy which would take advantage of the infinite number of openings provided by the newest technology and use them to further progress towards the goal of producing increasingly high quality products.
Therefore, our objective is to achieve an interactive audiovisual policy where there is more participation in order to give expression to the countless individual characteristics and differences in which our great European identity is rich.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Veltroni, on behalf of the Italian radicals, I cannot support the positive view you have expressed of the report under discussion on the Communication from the Commission on the guidelines for the Community's audiovisual policy in the digital age.
I cannot support your view because the communication is a reproduction of the old European TV and cinema clichÃ©: direct public intervention through State agencies, welfarism and disregard for the nature of the market, a clichÃ© which is characterising the audiovisual sector more and more.
All this has been dredged up and 'modernised' to suit the new digital age of multimedia convergence and the extraordinary spread of the Internet.
The impression therefore persists that European audiovisual companies are incapable of growing or standing on their own two feet and that users are incapable of discerning from among the vast amount of multimedia products on offer which products are better and most suited to their needs, as if past welfarism and paternalism had not been responsible for the difficult situation in which the sector finds itself today.
Everybody - companies and users alike - would benefit from the freedom of choice provided by a bold opening of the market and State withdrawal.
Moving on to some specific points of the report under consideration.
The regulation refers to the separation of infrastructures and content, serving up for content the old regulations once again.
But what does this mean?
Perhaps Mr Veltroni could enlighten us.
It may be, for example, that the intention is to extend the law governing the press, including related contracts and the need to be registered in the register of journalists and to be certified, to on-line publications.
In my view, this would be a serious error.
Or to extend the current stifling TV regulations to all the other programmes which are broadcast via the Web.
This would be a serious mistake, an illusion, for which the European companies and citizens would have to pay the price all over again.
The boom of the Internet was made possible by the State's inability to curb it with a mass of bans and regulations.
This was the right way for things to happen and it is right that they should remain that way.
With regard to intellectual property and copyright - another point covered by the report - I feel that it is pointless and damaging to the positive development of the Internet to strengthen the directive on copyright, as it is proposed to do.
Remember the Napster and the New Tell cases.
We consider that a critical revision of copyright ownership rights needs to be carried out in such a way as to facilitate and increase the transparency of the transmission of knowledge and products, and, on this point, the companies and the large corporations know that they will have to come to an agreement with the Web.
With regard to cinema, additional funding is requested for European cinema.
As Mr Veltroni is aware, there is a 50-year-old battle going on in Italy between the liberals, Sturzo and Ernesto Rossi, and those who want to continue with cinema subsidies.
We are of the opinion that the freedom of choice of the citizens to determine the success or failure of a film is also the best and most efficient way of ensuring the growth of the cinematographic sector.
We have tabled an amendment calling for a cost/benefit analysis of what has been done to date.
Lastly, on the subject of the privatisation of television, we call for a revision of the Amsterdam protocol which is referred to here as if it is set in stone.
The Financial Times has raised the issue of the privatisation of the jewel of European public television, the BBC.
Public television networks must be privatised or increasingly high licence fees will be imposed for new investments.
If we want to maintain a public service, the television broadcasting right must be auctioned off between all the operators: programmes will then be more efficient and there will be a saving for license payers.
I call upon you to consider the amendments we have tabled, which would change the intention of the report, following a system of aid incentives which has not worked in the past and will not work in the future either.
Mr President, I believe that the work carried out by the Commission and also by the rapporteur, Mr Veltroni, contains many important elements.
It is clear that a great effort has been made to introduce new issues and to take new steps in European audiovisual policy.
However, I believe that we still have a lot to do on certain points, both in the Commission and in Parliament.
We are very much lagging behind in relation to the huge changes taking place in the audiovisual sector, particularly as a result of digitalisation.
To fail to act would be like an ostrich burying its head in the sand.
I am sure that that is not what we want.
We all know that digitalisation began about five years ago and therefore this work on audiovisual policy is timely to say the least.
There are five points I would like to highlight because I believe that sooner or later they will have to be reviewed:
First is the definition of public service.
This is important if we want to have a public service in Europe in an environment which is truly competitive - and this can be seen from the audience for public services - and also for the good of the private audiovisual service.
There are still many issues to be resolved: one of them is the separation of the requirements established for each of these.
Secondly, it seems to me essential that there be a review of the "Television without Frontiers" Directive.
In this respect we are behaving like the aforementioned ostrich.
Thirdly, we must define in some way - and I believe that this document does not deal with this adequately - what is to happen with interactive TV services, what is to happen with the Internet on television.
The fourth point refers to the transfer from analogue TV to digital TV and its consequences for users in terms of the use and acquisition of new terminals.
Lastly, there is the implication of the laws on competition and mergers.
The audiovisual policy should tackle these points and also go into more depth in the field of competition.
Mr President, Mr Veltroni' s excellent report received firm support in Parliament' s Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and the same seems to be happening here, too, in plenary.
The move into the digital age is a massive revolution for the media.
This technical development offers the consumer still greater opportunities for using audio-visual products, in terms of time, place, content and equipment. At the same time, it means a splintering of the media and more pressure on development and commercialism.
The audio-visual sector is of the utmost importance to competitiveness, employment, and culture, too, in Europe.
The Commission' s initiative in this is also very welcome, as is the clarification of roles in respect of the information society and the main areas of culture.
Amid this technological revolution it is vital to bear in mind the social and cultural importance of media communications.
It cannot be a matter of equipment or financial gain.
The importance of the equality of information must not be underrated.
For that reason, I wish to stress the importance of safeguarding public service broadcasting in the future as well.
In that connection we must honour the Additional Protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam, according to which Member States decide how to organise public service finances.
We also have to make sure that people' s rights to receive information and cultural services in their own language are protected.
As a certain European historian said, a person' s native country in Europe in the future will be that person' s native language.
Television and film, as cross-border media, attract more interest than radio.
However, the importance of radio, particularly in minority language areas, should not be underestimated.
For radio to remain part of the digital age development it is important to establish a DAB standard for it.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the "Television without Frontiers" Directive.
At the same time, we know that the transition to digital TV involves a risk of its being precisely TV with frontiers that we end up with.
It will not be possible to watch the BBC in the Irish Republic.
It may no longer be possible to watch Swedish television as easily in Finland.
It has in the past been possible to watch television across national borders.
It is difficult to buy digital cards for existing pay TV.
I appeal to the Commissioner to bear in mind the urgent request made unanimously by the groups in Parliament in conjunction with the reading of the technical directive on digital TV and really to examine this issue which has a very great deal to do with the fact that the copyright organisations have not agreed upon sensible conditions for selling TV rights.
I would therefore urge the Commissioner to bear this in mind.
At the same time, I want to support a good deal of what Mrs Iivari said about minority language areas.
Those of us who are interested in defining public service on a national basis must be watchful.
We must be careful that, for example, competitive aspects do not have the unfortunate effect of undermining our national right to define the kind of public service we want to provide.
Not all languages are in fact equal in the EU in this respect.
Mr President, Commissioner, ever since they came into being, audiovisual means have been an important factor in ideological intervention.
Controlling them is of strategic importance in the digital age in order to mould consciences and a modus vivendi, because whoever controls them decides what information they should carry.
In the view of the Communist Party of Greece, they should be controlled by the public sector.
Not because we are labouring under the illusion that governments in a capitalist system will allow full and fundamental information, but because then we can have maximum possible social control.
The Commission, however, has relegated the public sector to the role of poor relation and market legislation to the role of basic regulator.
The purpose of this apparently anti-monopolistic policy is to create oligopolies, which will be equally unconducive to objective information but which will guarantee huge profits and more secure ideological orientation, with the flow of information controlled by a few European monopolies, to the detriment of any notion of freedom and democracy.
As far as we are concerned, the problem is not whether information will be controlled by American or European monopolies.
The real problem is that the people need to develop their resistance and enforce their right to fundamental information.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, digital technology is changing our lives, and this change is taking place whether we like it or not.
We have to make use of it and create the relevant statutory framework.
I should like to add to what the previous speakers have said by expanding briefly upon a few points.
The Lisbon Seminar on Digital Television, held under the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, unfortunately came up with little apart from an incomplete overview of the subject.
That is why I am calling for a Digital Europe initiative with clear plans for the harmonised introduction of digital television and the digitalisation of content.
Merely setting deadlines according to a motto to the effect that the whole of Europe is to go digital by 2010 is not enough.
Secondly, the industry should be given a fair chance to regulate itself along the lines of the code of conduct for added value telecommunications services in Austria.
Not everything needs to be over-regulated by the legislator.
Thirdly, audiovisual policy concerns infrastructure and content.
We know that, where the latter is concerned, we have fallen far behind the United States, despite quota rules.
Only those who provide exciting content for a large number of viewers are taken notice of.
We must therefore do everything to support European content suppliers and to make their work easier instead of more difficult.
Fourthly, the approach according to which content and infrastructure are closely regulated should be maintained.
In my own country, the blueprint for the media authority KOMMAUSTRIA presents an exemplary way of doing this in line with the eight draft EU directives we have on the information society.
We need to keep pace and ought not to lose any more time.
Mr President, the document presented by the Commission in relation to its policy in the audiovisual sector in the digital era includes, amongst other things, two ideas which I consider to be fundamental.
Firstly, we must safeguard the future of the dual system of public and private television, and it is essential that European public operators can make full use of the possibilities offered by the new information technologies.
Secondly, cultural and linguistic diversity is a fundamental objective of Community policy in the audiovisual sector.
To this end, I wish to propose that the Commission, in its action and aid, prioritise positive discrimination in favour of the audiovisual sectors of the regional and minority cultures and languages of the European Union.
A good way of favouring diversity is to give particular support to the weaker elements.
Similarly, I propose that Community legislation and the decisions of the Commission itself favour the idea that broadcasts of all mass events - ceremonies, shows, sport, etc. should be considered to be of general interest and can therefore be followed in all the languages of the European Union, including regional languages.
That is the only way we can make Europe into a true union of diversities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a glance at German cable television, where some 30 channels are now already jostling for attention, is enough to show that multiplicity is not the same thing as diversity.
In competition with commercial suppliers, there is easily a danger of succumbing to demands for mass appeal and neglecting less lucrative areas of interest.
That is why it is so important for audiovisual strategy to be linked to protection of the pluralism and diversity of opinion which are now the crucial bases for democratic opinion-forming, as well as for public service media to be guaranteed an equal opportunity to develop in the media market of the future.
There must be non-discriminatory access to this future market for all citizens, and there must also be non-discriminatory access for suppliers of all types of content.
Specifically, this means market transparency and preventing developments whereby economic power turns into the concentration of media ownership and finally into the abuse of political power.
These key considerations define the most important premisses for the further development of statutory frameworks.
Mr Veltroni's report makes important proposals in this area.
However, not everything can be regulated by law.
I should therefore like to address a matter which has still not been mentioned in this House, namely the acquisition of media-related skills.
You have to get to know your way around what the multimedia world has to offer in order to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff, select what is of value and hone your judgement.
The transfer of media-related skills must become a component of the Community' s audiovisual strategy.
To that extent, the Commission' s communication still does not go far enough.
Mr President, as Chairman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I would also like to personally acknowledge the extremely valuable work carried out by Mr Veltroni.
I am pleasantly surprised that such a major, essential measure has been able to obtain the unanimous consensus of the Committee, for I honestly did not think that it would have been possible.
Digitalisation will enable citizens to access a substantial quantity of new, innovative content and this is why I can only fully support Mr Veltroni's consideration that all this has implications for democracy, the organisation of Europe and the States and the quality of the communications that we provide for our citizens.
This is why I consider that the period of transition from the analogue to the digital system must be our opportunity to entice the user to sample a series of new programmes on offer, not just a mere duplication of the programmes currently available on unencrypted line-aside channels.
Mr O'Toole is right in saying that simulcasts would not make it possible to attract a group of substantial users and he therefore believes that a trial period for new audiovisual products on channels made available through digital transmission, possibly only over sections of territory, will enable operators and users to achieve the same objective.
The Commission is right to say that the system of funding adopted by the Member States must comply with the principle of proportionality and must not influence market conditions and competition in the Community in a way contrary to the interests of society.
In the audiovisual policy, the two fundamental criteria to be applied when drawing up provisions for funding are proportionality and transparency.
Transparency implies that the Member States should define a clear public service mission, that financial transparency should be guaranteed and that, if public service operators carry on purely commercial activities, separate accounts should be kept.
I consider that this separation has prompted the Commission to produce the best policy currently possible for the States and Europe, a policy worthy of the changing technologies and which will lead to the switchover of the entire system.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is pleased with the report drawn up by Mr Veltroni and the draftsman of the committee' s opinion, and I would like to thank the chair of the competent committee and its members for the pleasing unanimity they have managed to create within their committee on this draft report.
As you know, the Council also supported the Commission's approach in the conclusions approved at its meeting of 16 May this year, which makes for pleasing unanimity.
For once, the three institutions seem to be on the same wavelength and in perfect agreement, which makes me very happy.
In particular, the Commission welcomes Parliament's support on the regulatory principle described in the communication.
As you are aware, the Commission is to carry out a series of studies on the audiovisual sector and an extensive consultation with all the interested parties before proposing any revisions of the "Television without Frontiers" Directive, if the analyses suggest a need for this.
At this stage, before the research and consultations have been carried out, it would be extremely imprudent to speculate on any changes that might be decided by the experts and politicians.
The Commission takes note of Parliament's comments on this directive and will take due account of them in carrying out the examination planned for the end of 2002.
Just one detail, Mr Veltroni; in the Commission' s communication, it did not state that legislation on advertising needed to be revised in order to take account of the new digital technology.
It only said that it would carry out a study of this technology in order to verify whether or not a revision was necessary.
They will all decide together, however, whether or not a revision is necessary.
The Commission also agrees with Parliament that the principle of a clear demarcation between editorial content and advertising should be maintained in all forms of media.
With regard to the comments on the draft report concerning the pluralism of the media, it should be noted here that digital technology and in particular the Internet presents unprecedented possibilities for creating and developing a pluralist society.
For example, digital technology allows for a colossal increase in the number of channels, thereby reducing barriers to access for content producers.
This - and another speaker has said this - would mean ensuring that access does not end at borders, be they hypothetical or real.
The Internet also, at least potentially, allows each citizen to become a content producer themselves and creates the opportunity for a world-wide forum in which anyone can take part, with the advantages and dangers that that implies.
I think that one day we will have to discuss in depth what this advantage may also imply.
All of this changes the issue of pluralism, however, and makes it more complex.
The obstacles to pluralism in the digital world include poverty and a lack of education and training.
This issue was also raised by some Members and is something that prevents the general public from fully participating in the digital age.
The issue of the digital divide has been raised.
It is clear that we should all make a great effort to ensure that the gap between the information rich and the information poor, between those who participate and those who do not, is not too great.
I also agree with Mrs Junker when she says that we need to think, but also to propose plans of action to learn to read the media.
This is something that is very dear to me, and also to Jacques Lang with whom I have already discussed the possibility of developing this approach.
We will succeed, Mrs Junker, because we think that it is very important, not only to know how to read, write and add up, but also to know how to read images.
That is something we do not teach our little darlings.
With regard to the operators of digital media, the application of competition law currently seems to constitute an effective means of ensuring pluralism.
Nonetheless, other measures could, obviously, also be adopted, in the light of experience of the digital age and in response to Parliament's questions, the Commission will carry out consultations on these issues during its examination of the "Television without Frontiers" Directive.
I would also like to warmly welcome the quasi-unanimity on the MEDIA programme.
The digital revolution will open up many new ways of exploiting audiovisual works: video on demand via the Internet, for example.
The European industry must be able to make the most of these opportunities.
Nonetheless, we know that the European industry is still fragmented and weak in comparison with its American competitor.
Progress has already been made, however, in the past ten years.
For example, in almost all the Member States now, the most successful television programmes are national productions and not American productions.
A change has therefore already taken place.
At the same time, with regard to cinema, we can see a significant increase in the number of European successes.
So we must not stop, ladies and gentlemen, and I know that I have your support in this, but I need money to be able to carry out the new MEDIA plus programme.
This is the great danger that will affect the final decision on this project.
I hope that in the interests of European cinema in all our Member States, we will obtain good results in this area at the forthcoming 'Culture' Councils.
I would also like to draw the attention of those who are not here now but who have expressed criticism, saying that MEDIA and MEDIA plus only work at European level in addition to national systems that invest in production.
The MEDIA plus programme invests in promotion, distribution and digital training.
It is not, therefore, redundant, it is not something superfluous, but something that is absolutely necessary if we want our European films to circulate beyond the borders of their country of production.
With regard to certain proposals contained in Parliament's report on the cinema, the Commission has announced in its communication that it intends to draw up a communication dedicated specifically to the cinematographic sector, which will deal with questions such as the definition of European works, and although Mrs Fraisse is no longer here now, I would nonetheless like to say to her that this will not be easy and that if she wants to give us a hand, it would be very welcome.
The Commission communication will also consider State aid to cinematographic production, an issue that concerns us all.
Furthermore, this communication could also assess the need for intervention in this field at Community level and the opportunity to develop financial engineering mechanisms in favour of cinematographic productions.
One of today' s speakers has already referred to this.
You are well aware - I have said this to you several times - that discussions are underway with the European Investment Bank to create a capital risk fund in the autumn, if appropriate, with the intention of remedying the under-financing of our industry.
At this stage, the Commission takes note of Parliament's comments, but is not yet able to provide any further details.
But it must be clearly understood that we fully recognise the importance of public financing for audiovisual production and the need to provide for specific treatment in this area.
I would like to emphasise this last statement, as it is of primary importance for our whole political future.
Now, you all know that public service broadcasting is a very sensitive and highly complex issue, and the Commission has clearly explained its position many times, in particular in this communication.
Ladies and gentlemen, I agree that public service broadcasting plays a fundamental cultural and social role in our Member States and must therefore be safeguarded and authorised to play its role.
In light of technological developments and changes in the market, this role could change, but this subject must be debated in the Member States since, as the Amsterdam Protocol clearly specifies, it is up to the Member States to define the public service broadcasting mandate and decide on its financing system.
The Commission does not intervene in this area and the text on transparency is clear on this point.
By virtue of the Treaty, nonetheless, the Commission has a duty to ensure that the financing system does not affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to the detriment of the common good.
For the Commission to be able to do its job and in order to assess whether the advantages granted to the businesses in question correspond to the public service goals which are their responsibility, these goals must be defined by the Member State and their financing must be transparent.
Any commercial activity practised by these businesses must not, directly or indirectly, benefit from funds intended for public service.
Transparency requires this, and I believe that the recent texts issued by the Commission contribute to making these principles understandable, clear and transparent to all.
On this topic, the informal 'Culture and audiovisual' Council, which was held in Lille on 20 and 21 July this year, debated the future of public service broadcasting.
Certain ministers considered that a new additional stage of the Amsterdam Protocol was necessary, given the rapid technological development in this sector, and I have stated my readiness to discuss this issue with you and with those Ministers in the near future.
It should also be noted that the Commission recently adopted a revised version of the directive on transparency, as I have already mentioned.
This directive, most importantly, does not apply to public service broadcasting companies that do not practise any commercial activity.
Therefore, the public services defined by the State, with public financing clearly contained in the definition of public service, are not affected by the directive on transparency.
The concept of universal service is mentioned in the report.
In this respect, it should be noted that universal service is a concept borrowed from the telecommunications service, which in my opinion cannot be automatically transposed to the audiovisual sector.
Guaranteed access for citizens to certain broadcasting services and certain types of content is a question of defining the public service broadcasting mandate and, in accordance with the Amsterdam Protocol, is therefore the responsibility of the Member States.
The call for a European forum for discussing matters concerning all types of audiovisual content is an interesting proposal which the Commission will consider and study with the interested parties in its examination of the "Television without Frontiers" Directive.
It should be noted that, within the framework of the current directive, a contact committee has been created to examine all aspects of audiovisual policy linked to the directive.
With regard to international commercial negotiations in the audiovisual sector, I can tell you that there have been no developments.
The Commission has clarified its position many times.
It should retain its freedom, acquired during the Uruguay round, to draw up and implement financial and regulatory provisions in the audiovisual sector with a view in particular to safeguarding cultural diversity.
In its conclusions of 26 October 1999, the Council gave the Commission to undertake the forthcoming negotiations on services and I can frankly assure you that my colleague, Commissioner Lamy, is in full agreement with this direction.
We can be sure that he will safeguard and assist the European audiovisual sector in the way we want, the way you want, and if each person carries out the task assigned to him or her, we will all succeed in future in safeguarding and strengthening our audiovisual service, which is crucial to creating jobs and maintaining cultural pluralism.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Socio-economic background of Erasmus students
The next item is the report (A5-0199/2000) by Mr Heaton-Harris, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the report from the Commission: "Survey into the socio-economic background of Erasmus students" [COM(2000) 4 - C5-0146/2000 - 2000/2089(COS)].
Mr President, it is not often that a politician of my calibre gets to speak to such a packed and huge audience.
I should like to thank all the interpreters for staying behind.
I understand that my speech leaked out to the rest of the Members of Parliament beforehand, hence their disappearance in mass numbers.
Many of the interpreters, I am sure, would have liked to have studied on a Erasmus course when they were learning their languages and studying at university.
I, as a British Conservative, often find fault - and it is very easy to find fault - with many of the programmes organised and paid for by the European Commission and the European Union.
However I have a soft spot for Erasmus because it is very difficult to find fault with that particular programme.
It seems to achieve some of the results that it actually expects.
This survey is a fascinating one, carried out in 1998.
It was fascinating that so many students actually bothered to take part in filling out a form and sending it back to the Commission.
The one problem, I suppose, with the results of the survey was that they were reported after we had decided on the Socrates II programme and the Erasmus parts of it.
We could have drawn some very useful information from this survey on the socio-economic circumstances of students on Erasmus courses at that time.
There are a number of interesting facts and figures.
I could bore you with them but they are all contained within the explanatory statement of the report and in the Commission report itself.
But there are a few that I have a great deal of interest in.
Certainly of the people who took an Erasmus course in 1998 and bothered to reply to the questionnaire 98% found that the programme was extremely positive or at least very positive.
Ninety-one percent were over the moon with what had happened to them on the course.
It is a shame that 57% of them experienced financial hardship as a result of their particular Erasmus course.
One wonders whether, when only half the money is being spent on the Erasmus places being taken up, (half are left open at the end of each year) the money could not be better redistributed within Erasmus itself.
When I initially tabled my report I put forward a few controversial ideas just to see if anybody bothered to read what was going on.
Fortunately two or three Members (and the Commission as well) did read them.
A number noticed little points that I had to then retract.
But one which is still there in point 4 of my report, which I would like to underline, is the part that condemns any internal discrimination practised in Member States.
If you had trouble getting on a higher education course in Austria for example, because you were of a certain race, this place would have been in a complete uproar.
But that is exactly what is going on in my own country at the moment, with English students who want to study in Scotland being penalised financially by the Scottish Executive.
So I really wanted to keep that in my report.
I sneaked it in there and it stayed pretty much hidden until now, and I would like to reveal it to the very few people who are in the Chamber tonight.
I look forward to my new Labour colleagues voting on this particular matter.
I believe it is slightly too late to ask for a split vote.
I have also tabled a couple of amendments.
One helps with a bit of punctuation, a bit of grammar on the particular passage in point 4, the second in point 6.
In the committee stage of this report part of a sentence was added which said: "considers that the survey's findings should be taken as an opportunity to review national higher educational policies".
I do not think it is in the remit of this report or this place or the Commission to ask for that.
So I have tabled an amendment which would delete that.
A third amendment which I have tabled has changed just one word in the English language version from "regrets" to "notes".
I really enjoyed working with the Commission and all the people that have helped me.
I would like to end by thanking those who helped me with this report, especially my researcher Nicky Smith, who waded through every single statistic.
We contacted every university and vice-chancellor in the UK and many across Europe to ask for their comments on this report.
I commend it to the House.
Mr President, Commissioner, I know it is very late and not a lot of people are here. That should be no surprise to you, however.
It happens not only, thank heavens, where cultural and educational matters are concerned but also in many other areas.
I think, though, that, as you yourself have already said, quality speaks for itself.
You have briefly commented upon your report and your amendments yourself.
I am an Austrian and know from experience that, in Austria, there is very good access to all universities and courses of study.
I should also like to make it clear that we have no problem giving ethnic minorities access to these, either.
We certainly do not lag behind England, or Great Britain, in that area.
On the subject of the Erasmus programme, which is, after all, a part of the Socrates programme, I should like to say that - given the need not only to set up the programme but also to evaluate it - it is quite important to examine the efficiency of what is being offered and to carry out an assessment of the resources, if new knowledge is to be obtained and, above all, the defects in the programme removed.
It has already been said that new knowledge of this kind will unfortunately not have any impact upon the Socrates II programme.
I think we could have done to update things in this area, since 40% of the Socrates budget is, after all, being allocated to the Erasmus programme and, in that way, to students at European universities.
It was, and remains, the goal to make it possible for 10% of students to spend a part of their degree courses in other Member States.
Unfortunately, a figure of only 1% was achieved in the first year.
The participation rate has risen and is now just under 50% of the figure aimed at.
The report has shown that the reasons for this are both structural and cultural, as well as economic to quite a significant degree.
So far, there has been no success in complying with what is also laid down in the Socrates programme and giving a special boost to groups that are weak in socio-economic terms.
On the contrary, the programme is instead used by students whose parents have both a high level of education and a corresponding level of income.
Fifty-seven percent of Erasmus students had considerable difficulties financing their stay abroad.
I think there needs to be coordination between the Erasmus scholarships and the countries and the universities concerned. In that way, reform can be implemented and an information campaign launched in order to question, and shed some light upon, why so few people are able to participate in this programme.
Above all, it is a question of preserving equality of opportunity in all countries.
That is why it is worth showing some commitment.
I think that making equal opportunities available to young people is quite important for us all.
Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on this, his first report, which succeeded straightaway in achieving unanimity.
I feel this is a very promising beginning, although undoubtedly the subject lends itself to unanimity; indeed, I do not think that, amongst the impressive number of European programmes available to our citizens, there is a report that is as well-known and as much appreciated by the public, and not just by the students; recently, a grandmother stopped me in the street to thank me for what I was doing for her grandchildren, who were travelling abroad thanks to an Erasmus grant.
So, you see, these programmes also achieve the unanimity of the whole population and naturally, they can always be improved.
This year, 110 000 students are receiving the special attention that we give to all aspects of their Erasmus trip and to the smooth running of this section of the Socrates programme, and we thank Parliament for supporting this measure.
Admittedly, there are problems.
It is often said that only the children of fairly comfortably off families can travel as the others cannot live on this modest grant.
If we consult our statistics, however, 4 out of 5 Erasmus students were the first members of their family to study abroad, which does illustrate the role that this programme plays in the opportunities for mobility available in Europe to students of new social backgrounds.
Therefore, it is untrue that only children from privileged backgrounds can benefit from Erasmus grants.
Furthermore, even if the latter have more to live on because they receive additional help from their parents on top of their grant, in other respects it seems that these financial difficulties are the only criticism made.
Ladies and gentlemen, like you, I would have liked the amount of the loans allocated in the negotiations with the Council over the budgetary appropriations for the Socrates programme to be set at a higher level than they were since I am limited in my ability to increase Erasmus grants as much as I would like.
What conclusions can we draw from this?
Well, quite simply, the national bodies with decentralised responsibility for student mobility have to take the national situation into consideration and adapt the grant policy accordingly.
I have asked the Ministers for Education, each in their own country, to take the necessary steps to grant supplements and advantages for Erasmus students in order to offer those who are not fortunate enough to have a benevolent father or generous grandmother the chance to travel too.
I also urge each one of you to contact the Minister for Education in your country so that he will do all he can to remedy this financial problem.
I have asked the ministers to make sure that a larger grant is given to the poorest students.
I have asked the regional authorities to make an effort to assist their students and I have asked university rectors to provide for financial resources within their universities to enable students on lower incomes to still benefit from grants, if they want to and if they are eligible.
I think that in future, I will once again have to request the help of all the national and regional authorities in this area.
Furthermore, I shall consider this question in a moment as the French presidency wishes to develop a real action plan to foster mobility and together with the minister, Mr Jacques Lang, I have just set a specific meeting of the Ministers for Education on the theme of mobility.
On this occasion, we will not only talk about what we would like to do and what we should do in future, but we will cite examples taken from certain countries as models, but not necessarily at national level.
I will give you an example at random.
In one region of Germany, a regional Minister for Education has created a 'mobility' savings scheme in conjunction with banks and building societies so that parents, friends and families, instead of buying vast numbers of toys for children, invest in this scheme which will be available to the child when he is old enough to study abroad.
As you can see, there are good ideas, all sorts of good ideas.
I hope that the discussion on 'mobility' that the French presidency wanted will get this situation moving and that goodwill will be sought both at a private level and at regional, European and national levels so that the great success of Erasmus will encompass a growing number of students.
This is the price to pay for creating Europe, since students who have got to know another country within the framework of Erasmus, who have made friends in another country, at another university, are the true Europeans who will make European policy tomorrow.
A greater number of happy Erasmus students is in the interests of our society as a whole.
So let us all work together so that there will be a large number of them in future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Fisheries agreements
The next item is the joint discussion of the following reports:
by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (A5-0194/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation relating to the conclusion of the Protocol establishing the fishing possibilities and the financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea on fishing off the Guinean coast for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001.
[COM(2000) 304 - C5-0315/2000 - 2000/0154(CNS)]
by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (A5-0188/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation relating to the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period 3 December 1999 to 2 December 2002, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Mauritius on fishing in the waters of Mauritius [COM(2000) 229 - C5-0253/2000 - 2000/0094(CNS)]
Mr President, today we are discussing two new international fishing protocols between the European Union and third countries: Guinea and Mauritius, the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.
These two agreements are different in terms of geographical location, dimension, fishing allowances and financial compensation. However, at the end of the day, they are two important agreements which will add to the already significant network of international fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries, the basic pillar of the common fisheries policy, since it is essential to cover our supply requirements, both for the European consumer and for our industry, and it is also essential to do so by means of our own fleet.
The fisheries agreements with third countries therefore fulfil a crucial objective of the common fisheries policy, and they also contribute to employment and, in most cases, in European regions which are very dependent on this activity.
They therefore create commercial balance, employment and preserve the competitiveness of Europe' s own significant fishing fleet.
In its opinion on the 2001 budget, our committee has this afternoon approved the draft which our Vice-Chairman, Mrs MiguÃ©lez, had presented us, to increase budget line B7-8000 (International fisheries agreements) by EUR 7 million, thereby re-establishing the amounts in the preliminary draft budget presented at the time by the European Commission.
Morocco, Mauritania and Greenland are great negotiating challenges for the European Commission and we all hope that these negotiations will soon conclude successfully.
For the moment, we are happy today with the agreements with Guinea and Mauritius, which will cover important needs of different fleets, of different States of the European Union, in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
Notable in both cases is the constant and worrying increase in the payments by shipowners while, curiously, these are not included in other agreements, as is notoriously the case with the agreement with Greenland.
For example, in the case of Mauritius, there is an increase in the amount that shipowners are to pay for licences, of EUR 5 per tonne of fish, that is to say, they are increased from EUR 20 to EUR 25, and there is also an equivalent increase in the case of catches by ship.
The European Union' s contribution is reduced by 29%, payable by shipowners which, in the case of complete exploitation of the fishing allowances, would mean a contribution of 23.5% of the total cost.
In the previous protocol it was 7%, that is to say, there would be an increase from 7% to 23.5% of the total cost payable by shipowners.
In this context we also wish to highlight the imbalances in the internal distribution of these fishing allowances by the European Commission amongst the Member States, as was the case with cephalopods in the agreement with Guinea.
Both agreements give significant support to the local authorities for the conservation of their own fishing resources and furthermore advocate agreements between states as opposed to private agreements - which is very important in agreements such as the one with Morocco, which we are trying to negotiate - as well as the contribution of the European Union to the establishment of modern control systems, which forms part of the conservationist position of the European Union in all of the world' s seas, in accordance with its internal approach to its own Community waters.
On the other hand, there is an important direct relationship between the financial compensation and the objectives and cooperation actions that have been agreed.
In the case of the agreement with Mauritius, we are talking about 50%, as opposed to 30% in the previous agreement.
As is so often the case, there is a lack of documentation for comparing figures and data between the protocols, although in this case we should thank the European Commission for including the minutes of the negotiations, in the case of Guinea, which makes more data available and ultimately makes the process more transparent. This is welcome and the European Parliament is grateful for it.
The Committee on Fisheries has voted in favour of these agreements, and this has become the norm, since it considers that they are both highly beneficial to both parties, that is to say, the European Union and the third countries.
The Liberal Group has now presented Parliament with an amendment of similar content to each of the reports which would mean - in the view of the rapporteur - that the common fisheries policy would cease to be common and would mean a departure from an important pillar of external policy. It would mean that only the direct beneficiaries of the agreement negotiated by the European Commission would pay for it, on behalf of the fifteen Member States of the European Union.
The rapporteur is against this amendment, since, if only those who benefit directly from Community policies are to pay for them, that would quite simply be a way of breaking up the single market and dismantling the European Union itself.
We are therefore in favour of both fisheries agreements, which we hope may continue in the future, and we are anxious, Commissioner, to be able soon to hold a debate in our Fisheries Committee, and to repeat what we are saying now, in relation to the extremely important fisheries agreement with Morocco.
Keep up the hard work - I can see from the conversation we had this afternoon that you are working hard - and I encourage you also to move forward with that important negotiation.
Mr President, Commissioner, in principle I approve the new protocols to the fisheries agreements with Mauritius and Guinea.
The Commission and the rapporteur have done some good work.
However, the effects of fisheries agreements upon the EU budget are not something to be sneezed at.
If we are to draw the correct conclusions, no more time must now be lost in involving Parliament, because trouble is brewing.
Allow me to explain what I mean.
We are concerned here with mixed agreements.
It is not just a question of how many fish are to be obtained for how much money, but also about employing the precautionary principle to achieve the sustainable use of fisheries resources.
We want to help Mauritius and Guinea develop fisheries management, as well as offer financial support in the fields of education and research.
In Mauritius, for example, just under 50% of the total volume of available finance is to be used for these measures.
I myself consider it a good thing for us also to be promoting development measures in connection with fisheries.
Fisheries is the ideal field for such a combination.
Yet, in the Committee on Fisheries, we are repeatedly confronted by the issue of whether the price paid by the European Union to third countries for its fishing rights is not too high.
There is a danger of the European Union' s one day being ridiculed and taken advantage of internationally because of its generosity.
Moreover, to what extent are third countries now really all dependent upon EU funds?
Bilateral agreements are increasingly coming into force because ship owners or others offer more money than the EU.
If the latter were to become a day-to-day occurrence regulated by the market itself, might not consideration have to be given to the question of whether the EU ought not progressively to withdraw from the current agreements and perhaps spend its subsidies in other ways?
Obviously, that would have to be compatible with the common European fisheries policy.
I welcome the agreements that are before the House. Only, we ought not to be blind and, above all, not issue any blank cheques.
Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the proposal for a Council Regulation on the European Community fisheries agreements with Mauritius and the Republic of Guinea.
Both agreements fall within a general European Community policy based on our presence in the rest of the world.
The fishing sector forms part of the Community' s economy and, in order for the Community fleet to be able to fish and carry out its activity, the Community must reach agreements with third countries and international organisations, so that our fishermen can enjoy adequate fishing allowances.
Both agreements have been renewed regularly.
In the case of Guinea we have had an agreement since 1983 and in the case of Mauritius since 1989.
There can be no doubt about the cost-effectiveness of these agreements for the European Union, as demonstrated in the study commissioned by the Commission on their cost-benefit relationships.
Nor can we doubt the beneficial effects for the other contracting parties, in this case Mauritius and the Republic of Guinea.
Both countries gain valuable resources for their development in exchange for the fishing allowances which they grant to our fleet.
These are agreements which benefit both parties and which have been amended over time, being adapted to the demands of the sustainable exploitation of resources and of actions supporting the efforts of the authorities in the third countries to develop their own fishing sector.
The protocols that periodically renew the agreements have been adapted to the true situation, to the quantities of fish actually caught and the state of resources in those fishing grounds.
Despite reducing the quantity of catches in the agreement with Guinea, the economic compensation to be received by the African country will be maintained, since the new protocol increases the amount of the tariffs and the licences which must be paid by Community shipowners.
Therefore, the contrast with other agreements - I would like to highlight, for example, the agreement with Greenland, in which the shipowners do not contribute to its cost - is the all the more drastic.
In the case of Mauritius, it also reduces the volume of authorised catches and specifies the number of vessels authorised to fish.
The approval by the European Parliament of these two fisheries agreements sends a political message demonstrating our support for the signing and renewal of other fisheries agreements which are of much greater importance for our sector because of the number of ships and fishermen which depend on them.
I am referring in particular to the agreement with Morocco.
Seven hundred ships out of action is excessive, and 8 000 fishermen not working for 10 months are far too many, given that the contacts so far between the Commission and the Moroccan Government have offered little hope of success.
Everybody must do their duty and fulfil their obligations.
This institution has done so, with its Committee on Fisheries approving today, in a special meeting, the amounts proposed by the European Commission in the B7-800 line on fisheries agreements with third countries.
It now falls to the European Commission to negotiate hard in order to reach a reasonable agreement with Morocco.
We are still waiting for that to happen.
Mr President, may I first of all thank the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, Mr Varela, for a particularly good piece of work on these reports.
In principle, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party support the EU' s having fisheries agreements with third countries, but I should also like to point out that what we in the Liberal Group want - and this is why we have tabled a number of amendments - is for the fishermen or ship owners to make more of a contribution to financing the fisheries agreements.
It is, of course, only right that they should be involved in financing those agreements from which they themselves benefit more than anyone else.
The fisheries agreements are extremely important for certain regions in which, in addition to employment in the fisheries sector itself, there are a range of associated businesses wholly or partially dependent upon the fishing industry.
By means of the fisheries agreements, the EU is able to develop its activities in this sphere and exchange fishing rights with third countries.
The effect of the EU fleets upon fishing resources - in terms of structural policy and the financial situation - ought to be analysed much more than it is at present.
I want to conclude by asking the Commission to provide the Committee on Fisheries with a report on what for third countries are the positive and negative consequences of the EU' s fisheries agreements.
Mr President, last October I spoke here against the EU-Angola fisheries agreement.
My reason for doing so was simple.
All the evidence shows that agreements between the EU and third world countries have been conservation disasters.
They also seriously damage the indigenous populations.
This time we have proposals for agreements with Guinea and Mauritius, which will have similar effects.
In a way, that much is recognised in the current proposals.
More stringent checks are being called for.
Inspection vessels are to be provided, and greater note taken of the needs of local fishermen.
But that is not enough.
There is no guarantee that these agreements will be properly policed.
Policing of fishing effort in European waters is woefully inadequate, and it is therefore hard to believe that things will be any different in foreign climes.
In addition, British fishermen from the south-west of England to the north of Scotland are continuing to suffer greatly because of the common fisheries policy.
Fishermen are discarding thousands of tonnes of saleable fish and going bankrupt in the process, yet while this economic and conservation disaster is in progress, the EU is proposing to spend over EUR 7 million to give Greek, Spanish and Italian fishermen access to the waters.
By any standards, this is preposterous.
Not only will I vote against these proposals, but I shall urge my government to oppose them.
Mr President, I welcome the Commission' s two proposals on these two fisheries agreements, particularly the agreement with Guinea.
I should like to begin by highlighting and expressing my support for the innovations introduced by the current agreement, which dedicate 50% of the European Union' s total support to specific actions aimed at the sustainable development of the sector.
Amongst other new aspects of this agreement, I also wish to highlight the innovation of providing an additional premium of EUR 370 million in the event that the Republic of Guinea implements a range of actions designed to reduce its overall fishing effort.
As Guinea is a country with an annual available production of 250 000 tonnes of fish, and since its small-scale fishing fleet only has the capacity to catch 50 000 tonnes, this is clearly an agreement of mutual convenience, which avoids any conflict of interest and which also enables Guinea to obtain exceptional financing to develop its fisheries sector.
We see from this that, apart from the importance of fisheries agreements for the European Union, they can also be used as instruments for development in these countries.
As a Portuguese citizen, I am bound to regret the fact in this context that the Commission and the Council are so far behind in their negotiations on the agreement with Morocco.
I am also unhappy at the difficulties being raised over other Member States having access to fisheries belonging to Greenland, the agreement with whom has hardly been used, and which is shortly due for renewal.
It is nevertheless important that the requirements of supervision and control, as well as the programmes designed to control the reduction of the fishing effort are also imposed on the other countries that fish in the waters of these developing countries and not only on the Member States of the European Union.
I therefore ask the European Union, during its negotiations, to make an extra effort to ensure that this rule is applied to everyone and not just to us.
Mr President, sadly, all too often in the past, the reorganisation of the European fishing fleet has led to these ships being transferred to the African coast.
They was no limit on the extent to which they could be used there, which posed a serious threat, not just to the fish stocks but also to the livelihoods and the food supply of the people in the local area.
Accordingly, when we draw up these fisheries agreements, we should not just take account of the interests of the European fishermen, we must also bear in mind the interests of the local population.
The agreement with Mauritius concerns the tuna fish catch, but the situation is far more complex for Guinea.
European ships fish there for fish species that are used by the local fishermen.
It is encouraging to see that in both agreements 50% of the financial contribution will be allocated to developing the local fishing industry.
Control over how this money is spent is certainly prerequisite to the future extension of the Protocol.
Private contracts between European shipowners and the Guinean Government are often concluded without this form of assistance from the local fishing industry, and contribute to over-fishing due to a lack of controls.
A very worrying recent development is that small French trawlers are concluding contracts outside the fisheries agreement.
These trawlers will fish in the coastal zone, where they are a direct threat to local fishermen.
All Member State ships should respect an economic twelve-mile exclusion zone.
In addition, I feel it goes without saying that shipowners should contribute more to the costs of the fisheries agreements and that the tax payer should not be the one to subsidise this exploitation of fishing grounds.
Mr President, first of all I would like to compliment the Commission, and also our rapporteur, on the agreement reached.
The agreement takes more account of the developing countries themselves, in this case Guinea and Mauritius, than was formerly the case.
That is something in its favour and what it in fact means is that these agreements should actually fall to be considered under the codecision procedure with Parliament. Perhaps this will take place next year though, after the IGC.
I am critical of a number of other points.
I believe it is a sound agreement.
Clearly this agreement is extremely important to the countries of the south; after all, the southern fisheries agreements are directly responsible for 13 000 jobs in Spain and Portugal, among others.
The turnover is no mean feat either, amounting as it does to around EUR 485 million, in comparison with which, an agreement with Greenland, for example, pales into insignificance.
This means that the sums set aside for this purpose will also mainly be spent in these countries.
There is something to be said for this alone.
Historically, these countries had their agreements, but it would be a positive move if the business community itself were to make more of a contribution to this kind of agreement.
I mention this because a balance must be struck between developing countries and countries with a large fishing industry, but it is also necessary to strike a balance in the way funds are spent across the various fishing zones.
That being the case, I would point out that certain countries in the north, of which my own country is one, have great difficulty with the cutbacks they are experiencing in the multiannual orientation programme.
The honourable member from Great Britain has already described the problems the fishing sector is having to contend with there.
This simply means that when it comes to the fisheries policy, we must look with a critical eye at this agreement in order to ascertain where the interests lie and how the money is being spent.
It is quite clear that regional elements are going to play a more prominent role.
Let there be no mistake, I think this agreement is indispensable to Spanish and South European fishermen - that is the first point - but I think it is also essential for a regional policy to allow for restructuring of the fishing industry in the northern coastal areas, to offer scope for sound agreements with northern countries, and for it to be properly tailored to specific regional needs.
Mr President, it seems that the Commission is happy to ignore the requests of the Council and this Parliament - the former clearly expressed at the Council of Ministers of October 1997 - and delay the work on the guidelines for the negotiation of the fisheries agreements.
The protocol with Guinea-Conakry is a good example.
We expected the payment quota for shipowners to be increased, but it is intolerable that, in the Council working groups, the Commission is prepared to describe that increase as light, given that it means an ever-greater sacrifice for the fleet and that - I repeat - in the agreements with the northern countries, shipowners do not pay a penny.
Furthermore, the Commission has been prepared to ignore the principle of relative stability by casually removing from the Community fleet fishing rights that have been acquired in accordance with that principle.
The principle of relative stability is either sacred or it is not, and it cannot be untouchable in Community waters when the complete opposite is the case in the fisheries agreements with the southern countries.
The Commission says that it has taken away Spain' s allowances for fishing cephalopods because it did not fully utilise them during the last protocol, and it grants them to countries which had never fished there. That is all very well.
I have always argued for the total exploitation of the fishing rights granted, but in all waters, not just in relation to the agreements with the southern countries.
In the agreements with the northern countries they are completely under-exploited and there is no way that the fleets with the greatest interest in fishing there can do so.
Why do these differences exist?
Could you please explain this once and for all.
Furthermore, what makes the Commission think that, because it did not utilise the fishing allowances during the previous protocol, it will not do so during this one, given that its cephalopod-fishing fleet which was fishing in Morocco has been out of action for nine months and there is no solution in sight?
Mr President, all of this illustrates the mental and physical chaos of our Community fishing authorities, and it will only be resolved when the guidelines which I referred to earlier are established in a clear and agreed way.
Can I first of all welcome the report and congratulate the rapporteur for his work in bringing forward this report?
There is little doubt that fisheries agreements are coming under much closer scrutiny to determine what they achieve and what they deliver, not only for people in the European Union, but also for the countries with which they were concluded in the first place.
The rapporteur rightly mentioned the agreement with Morocco several times.
This agreement is causing tremendous concern to the people most directly affected and those who might benefit to some extent and has certainly prompted great disquiet in the Fisheries Committee.
I want to ask the Commissioner very straightforwardly and point-blank whether the Commission, and Parliament, and the European Union are being held to ransom by Morocco because of its unwillingness to agree.
Perhaps he could give an answer when he comments on the debate later on.
We cannot overlook the concern about fisheries agreements.
They are expensive and the amount of money involved is substantial.
The money has to be taken into account to a greater extent in the future, and we cannot pretend otherwise.
Yes, in the past the agreements have been acceptable, but we need a new approach and a new vision in the future.
In the longer term the Commission will have to cooperate with Parliament, because Parliament is concerned to determine how agreements can best be achieved.
Looking at what we have before us, I have to say to you, Commissioner, that the present situation cannot continue.
Yes, I support the proposal submitted and I will support the proposal that emerges, but I wish to stress that the principle cannot continue for ever and support in the future cannot be taken for granted as it has been in the past.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to say a warm thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, for the two reports he has submitted today when the new protocol for a fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Republics of Mauritius and Guinea is up for discussion.
Where the first agreement with Mauritius is concerned, I am glad to hear that you support the new technical features, as well as the further amendments to this protocol as these relate, for example, to the distribution of costs, to the increased finance available for scientific programmes, to monitoring and control and to subsequent financing.
The agreement with Mauritius is a typical tuna fish agreement, involving a small number of fishing opportunities for line fishermen, and forms an important component of the EC network of tuna fish agreements in the Indian Ocean.
This new protocol is the fourth since the Framework Agreement came into force in 1990.
The three-year extension to the protocol creates fishing opportunities for 83 tuna fishermen and, by means of this protocol, the October 1997 guidelines of the Fisheries Council are to be included in the agreement for the first time, namely an increase in specific measures for developing the fisheries sector and a new distribution of the costs between the Community and the ship owners.
Among the most important features of the protocol is the fact that, in view of the small quantities of fish caught during the three years that the last protocol was in force, the authorised tonnage has been reduced from 7 500 tonnes to 5 500 tonnes, which will also lead to a corresponding reduction - namely of 29% - in compensation payments.
I can also inform you that 50%, that is to say half, of compensation payments are intended for specific measures to develop the local fisheries sector.
Measures in the fields of science and technology, including plans for monitoring and control, are to be financed.
In this connection, I should like to emphasise that the conditions for monitoring such measures have been improved by the fact that the authorities on Mauritius now have to submit a detailed report each year and by the fact that the Commission is able to review payments in the light of whether the various measures have in practice been carried out.
Licence fees for ship owners have been considerably increased, from EUR 20 to EUR 25 per tonne.
All in all, the protocol has led to a comprehensive redistribution of the costs between the Community and the ship owners, since the latter now have to bear 23.5% of the total costs compared with a previous figure of only 7%.
That is in line with the Council' s 1997 decision in connection with the third country agreements, whereby costs are to be distributed in a balanced way.
There are also technical improvements when it comes to catch notifications, the deduction of fees due and the procedures for taking catches on board.
If I understand you correctly, you also welcome the technical features we have introduced into the agreement with Guinea, especially the fact that, by means of a special premium, more attention is being given to the development of marine resources.
Since 1983, we have also maintained a Framework Agreement with the Republic of Guinea.
This agreement too is important for the European Union because it specifies fishing opportunities for trawler and tuna fishermen.
Within the framework of the agreements with various neighbouring States, particularly Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco, it also offers a partial alternative for the fisheries industry during the close seasons.
It also, to some degree, offers an alternative to Moroccan waters.
I am therefore pleased to be able to inform you that the protocol with the Republic of Guinea contains important innovations, aimed especially at promoting the precautionary principle and the sustainable use of resources.
I should like specifically to mention at this point that a premium is to be introduced for the purpose of supporting the Guinean authorities in improving fish stocks in Guinea' s exclusive economic zone.
This premium will only be paid if Guinea can prove that its overall fishing activities have been reduced and that the agreed measures aimed at more stringent monitoring and control have been applied.
The idea is that we want to support Guinea in promoting bilateral fisheries agreements with other States and in reducing the number of private arrangements which frequently undermine sustained fisheries management.
What is more, 46% of the total aid package is now to be spent on the financial counterpart for specific measures such as scientific and technical research and the monitoring and inspection of fishing activities, as well as on supporting technical training and further education in the sphere of fisheries and on supporting participation in the work of international organisations.
Finally, the protocol provides for close cooperation between both parties in administering the measures.
Monitoring is to be facilitated by means of a detailed financial report and by the Community' s ability to review payments in the light of whether or not the measures have in practice been carried out.
Where your amendments are concerned, I should like to make it clear that the Commission can in principle accept the first two of these.
The Commission has to reject Amendment No 3 because it contradicts the current theory on protocols to fisheries agreements and affects the Commission' s negotiating powers.
Since the protocol constitutes an annex to the Framework Agreement, it can be regularly renewed without the need for any new negotiating mandate.
It goes without saying however that, with its leading role in the negotiations, the Commission will see to it that the negotiating guidelines laid down by the Council are observed.
The Commission must also reject Amendment No 4 because it contravenes the spirit of the Council' s 1997 decision calling for a distribution of costs between ship owners and the Community.
Many thanks for your attention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
We have exhausted the agenda and ourselves, I think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I bid you goodnight.
(The sitting was closed at 11.25 p.m.)
Annex - formal sitting
It is my very great pleasure to welcome Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, and Mr Ahmed Qurie, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Assembly, to the European Parliament. I am thrilled to be able to do so, and to do so with great hopes for peace.
I would like to thank you both for the courage and open-mindedness with which you have both accepted the invitation I made to you during my official visit to the Middle East in February this year.
Your joint visit is unprecedented in the history of this institution.
It has been made possible because you are both men of peace, and it is as such that Parliament welcomes you here today.
I am mindful that your visit is also due in great part to the persuasive diplomatic efforts of our fellow Member, Luisa Morgantini, Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, whom I must thank particularly for this.
(Applause)
It is highly significant that, in your capacities as the speakers of the two assemblies which will be required to ratify the agreements which are being drawn up, and in which negotiations you are yourselves taking part, you have opted to come together to address the European Parliament.
We appreciate the true worth of your approach: the value of your shared determination to reach a peace agreement, the determination to see Europe involved in the ongoing process to a greater extent, and let me welcome Ambassador Moratinos at this point, and the determination to step up your cooperation with the European Union at parliamentary level.
There is not one of us who is unaware of the complexity of the situation in the Middle East, in this land which is home to what a large part of the human race considers to be the most sacred historic sites, which are hence the most disputed sites.
We Europeans are in a good position to know just how difficult it is to make peace rather than war.
It has taken us, particularly in the twentieth century, devastating wars which have ravaged the entire world with the tragic loss of millions of lives before realising, at last, that war is a madness which wreaks universal ruin.
The European Parliament is not welcoming you here today in order to preach at you, but as a friend to the two nations you represent, which are both finally entitled to peace, security and development.
When the same process is under way in the Middle East as the one which has brought Europe not only from armed conflict to peace, but from peace to cooperation between neighbouring countries, perhaps we can envisage a parliamentary assembly uniting the peoples of your region as our counterpart!
What a wonderful dream this would be, and I am sure that our shared determination will one day make it a reality.
Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Knesset, Mr Abu Ala, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the debate which you have just heard has testified to the European Union' s and, in particular, the European Parliament' s interest in the progress of the current negotiations.
Your may rest assured that we shall be listening to your words with the utmost attention.
Allow me to hope, without denying the major obstacles, weighty as we know them to be, during this crucial phase of the negotiations, that you will be able to assure this House that the gateway to peace will remain open and that both your nations will go through it together.
Without further ado, I shall give the floor first to Mr Abu Ala and then to Mr Burg.
Mrs Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my great pleasure at the dialogue we have had this morning on the peace process and Europe' s great interest in the success of this process and in establishing a climate favourable to this peace.
Let me also express my great pleasure at seeing a great number of European leaders who have distinguished themselves in working and in continuing to work in a serious way in order to find a solution to the problem of the Middle East.
It is my very great honour, as President of the Palestinian Legislative Council, to accept your invitations to this significant meeting with the elected representatives of the nations of the European Union.
I am delighted to address you today alongside Mr Avraham Burg, President of the Knesset, the Israeli national parliament, to give you a frank, clear and open picture of our hopes and sorrows, our suffering and the difficulties we are encountering at this crucial stage of the Middle East peace process.
We were hoping, and we continue to hope, to be able to meet the first years of the twenty-first century having prepared our region for a new era, an age free from struggle and bloody warfare, free from violence or terrorism, and to establish, with your help, a place, which we would like to safeguard and develop, favourable to peace and coexistence between the nations of a region which for so long has suffered the torments of awful bloody conflict and the murderous language of arms.
Your great experience will prove invaluable in this.
Madam President, with great respect, let me mention your important visit to Palestine and to the Legislative Council.
Let me mention your laudable efforts to support us and to support the building of democracy by the Legislative Council in our country, on the one hand, and your support for the peace process on the other, and the invitation to Mr Burg and myself to establish dialogue with you.
It is my pleasure to inform you that I have worked together with Mr Burg, making modest but sustained contributions towards consolidating the foundations of cooperation between our two parliaments and devoting every possible effort to consolidating the peace process and making a success of it.
I am deeply convinced that problems, however great, must neither defeat the dreams and ambitions of our peoples nor destroy their hopes of living in peace and security.
We promise that we shall continue our endeavours, with the help of the popular backing we have and your own support.
Madam President, throughout successive historic periods, the land of Palestine has experienced marvellous forms of human coexistence and religious tolerance among various communities and religions.
It has also seen the meeting and fraternal coexistence of the three monotheistic religions expressed in religious freedom, respect for faiths and the practices of different forms of religion.
Palestine is thus the home of the prophets of peace.
Within its borders we have seen the development of the messages of God to the whole human race: Islam, Christianity and Judaism.
The Holy Land, and the neighbouring regions, blessed by God, should be big enough to accommodate all the monotheistic regions and to be the land of love and peace.
However, despite the divine blessing, this land has undergone many conflicts throughout history.
The twentieth century, which saw the tragedy of the Jewish people in Europe, has also borne witness to the tragedy of the Palestinian people in their own country, when the rest of the world started to look for a solution to Europe' s Jewish problem in the land of Palestine.
In 1947, the United Nations Organisation proposed a plan for the partition of Palestine into two States, with the Jewish State to cover the greater part of Palestine and an Arab State to have the smaller part.
The Jewish State was declared on 15 May 1948, and was immediately recognised by the countries of the West, led by the countries of Europe and the United States, who granted this State all the necessary support while the Palestinian people continued to endure every form of privation, emigration, the enforced displacement of persons, and the lack of their own country, their own identity or their own State.
This situation contributed greatly to paving the way for violence and war.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conflicts and the wars in our region have wrought havoc, causing destruction, desolation and enormous losses in human and material terms.
Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the region experienced many wars and confrontations which caused death and destruction everywhere, reducing the region' s economies to war economies, undermining development operations in many countries and causing scientific and cultural backwardness in others.
The Palestinian people were the most seriously affected of the entire region, and have paid the highest price, politically, economically and socially.
Following the major problems related to Israel' s isolation from its neighbours, the permanent state of alert related to the state of war in the region and the harsh suffering of the Palestinian people remaining on Palestinian territory or becoming refugees abroad or in the camps, it was essential to take the initiative of finding an alternative to war and bloody conflict.
Peace therefore became the only option which fulfilled the aspirations of the peoples of the region for stability and development, to live in peace and security.
In order for such a peace to be lasting and general, however, it had to be fair.
The peace process was launched in Madrid in 1991.
We took part in this process, driven by our sincere determination to arrive at a just peace throughout the region in general and between Palestinians and Israelis in particular.
This process is based on Resolutions 242 and 338 of the United Nations Security Council, which stipulate the inadmissibility of acquiring alien territories by force.
It is also based on the search for a fair solution to the refugee problem and on the principle of territories in exchange for peace.
In accepting these resolutions, we have accepted that we shall have only 23% of the territory which Palestine had historically, and this is a major concession, let me stress, a major concession, which the Israeli political leadership refuses to admit into the negotiations on the permanent status, citing the intransigence and inflexibility of the Palestinians as an excuse.
In accordance with these principles, we have committed ourselves to the peace process, driven by the conviction that it is essential to put an end to this long, bloody chapter and to arrive at a just peace, which is something we are all hoping and praying for, after a long period of enmity and painful, destructive conflict.
Our priority right now is to resurrect these hopes which for a long time had remained missing or hidden, by preparing the environment and the regional economic and political climate for the establishment of relations of development and regional economic cooperation enabling the influx of investment and projects into this region of ours which has been exhausted by conflict and bled dry by the exorbitant cost of the wars.
The Washington talks and, similarly, those which took place in Oslo, led to an agreement in the form of a Declaration of Principles, the Oslo accords.
The PLO exchanged mutual recognition documents with the Israeli Government, in what was in my view the most significant phase in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict in general and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in particular.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Declaration of Principles for the transitional period and for the talks on Permanent Status was drawn up on the basis of a defined philosophy and clear political principles, particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and their implementation, the territories in exchange for peace and a timetable for the negotiations on the permanent status.
In addition, we also agreed to put the finishing touches to the stages of a gradual solution, starting with the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, at the same time as the gradual transfer of power and civil and security authority to the Palestinian Authority.
During this phase, presidential and legislative elections would take place in the West Bank, in the Gaza Strip and the Arabic city of Jerusalem, Al-Quds.
Supposedly, by the end of this period, all the territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would have been handed over to the Palestinian Authority, except for the issues of the negotiations on permanent status, namely: Jerusalem (Al-Quds), settlements, borders, refugees, relations with other neighbours, and one item added subsequently, water.
This would be accompanied by the gradual establishment of a Palestinian administration provided with executive, legislative and legal bodies.
All this was to be achieved in less than five years, by 4 May 1999, and to be crowned by the creation of an independent Palestinian State.
We accepted these accords and complied with their implementation, but unfortunately we encountered serious problems, and faced continuous attempts to break the agreements and to reject what had been agreed, and also non-compliance with the agreed schedule, particularly the third-phase troop redeployment, the withdrawal from the occupied territories and the release of all prisoners and detainees, which was supposed to be completed by the end of the interim period, on 4 May 1999.
So many elements relating to the transitional period have still not been implemented, despite the long period of time which has elapsed, increasing the suffering of the Palestinian people and jeopardising the entire peace process.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I belong to a generation which has lived through five devastating wars which have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people and have caused millions of people to be displaced far from their homes and their property.
At the same time, I was a member of the generation of the Palestinian political leadership with an awareness of the values of the national struggle, without necessarily losing the ability to take on a good measure of courage, wisdom and objectivity, capable of looking for a permanent overall solution which would make it possible once and for all to put an end to murderous warfare and bloody conflict.
I had the opportunity to lead negotiations with the Israeli Government over the last eight years, from the initial Oslo negotiations up to the Stockholm negotiations which prepared the way for the recent Camp David Summit, via the second Oslo negotiations, the economic negotiations in Paris and the negotiations preparatory to the Wye River agreement.
I have often expressed my pride in what I have achieved together with my colleagues, the Palestinian peacemakers, led by President Arafat, our wise and courageous leader, with faith in the cause of peace and its inevitable victory, despite the obstacles on the way and the faintness of the glimmer of hope.
For several months we have been engaged in talks to establish permanent status, even before Israel has completed its commitments under the interim period.
I must, however, express my feeling of regret and bitterness that the Israeli Government has not fulfilled the commitments undertaken for the interim period and that we have not yet concluded a permanent agreement.
I am also very regretful and sorry that the Camp David Summit did not have a successful outcome, especially since it came eight months after strenuous negotiations in the region, but also in Stockholm, in Sweden, and in Washington, and followed the considerable efforts made by President Clinton and his colleagues.
I feel that I must outline the nature of the Camp David Summit talks and the attitudes which informed them.
With the Israeli team, we agreed upon a number of general principles, which are as follows: firstly, these negotiations are based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and their terms; secondly, the key to the solution lies in agreement on a number of key issues: Jerusalem (Al-Quds), refugees, territory, frontiers, and security.
Thirdly, we agreed that we would not postpone finding a solution to any of the key issues: there must be agreement on all the issues or there would be no agreement.
Fourthly, agreement on each of the key issues, either in a framework agreement or in the definitive agreement, must include these three important principles: firstly, recognition of the principle, secondly, recognition of the mechanisms implementing the principle, thirdly, agreement on the time limit for the execution thereof.
We also agreed upon the need to obtain international guarantees for the execution of terms and an international instrument for arbitration in the event of a dispute.
What were our positions?
Although both parties, Palestinians and Israelis, made considerable efforts to reconcile their positions, both during the talks or during the Camp David Summit, I must regretfully inform you that there is still a great gulf and that it will still take a lot to bridge that gulf.
As far as Jerusalem is concerned, let me tell you briefly that the Palestinian position is based on the fact that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967. The same rules applied to the other Palestinian territories must also be applied to Jerusalem.
Israel must recognise Palestinian sovereignty of Jerusalem and, in return, we are willing to discuss any Israeli concerns about the city, whether regarding Jerusalem as an open city, or about freedom of worship and freedom of movement within Jerusalem, or any other Israeli concerns.
The Israeli position, however, still continues to hinge on the following point: the unified Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Israel regardless of all the proposals which have been put forward.
Let me now take this opportunity to inform you from the rostrum of the European Parliament that, although we cannot reach an agreement on the issue of Jerusalem, we Palestinians agree that both parts of Jerusalem, East and West, should be a unified Jerusalem, an international Jerusalem, and it should not be the capital of Israel and Palestine alone, but of the whole world.
You will be aware that the United Nations Organisation, the Security Council, adopted Resolution 181 to make this holy city the city of the three monotheistic religions, the city of those that believe in one God, and decided that Jerusalem would be an international city which belonged to all the nations of the world.
Moreover, I would say that if there is a great gulf between us, it is on the issue of Jerusalem.
On the subject of refugees, we consider, and I think you agree, that every person is entitled to return to their home and to their property.
On that basis, we consider that any solution must involve Israel accepting its legal, moral and political responsibility for the emergence of the refugee problem.
Otherwise, any solution would be truncated or incomplete.
The Palestinian position in this respect is based on international resolutions on the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and to their property, and their right to compensation in accordance with Resolution 194 of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and on the determination of procedures, obtained following agreements, enabling them to exercise their right to return.
The Israeli position has moved away from the fundamental issue, refusing to discuss the principle of return or substituting proposals for solutions mentioning humanitarian operations limited to reuniting a few families or establishing an international compensation fund which Israel would participate in alongside other States.
In the light of these differences, the gulf on this issue still remains, and it was not possible to bridge it during the Camp David Summit, or at the end of it.
On the issues of territories, borders and security, our position is that confirmed by resolutions with international legitimacy, based on the inadmissible nature of the occupation of alien territory by force.
In addition, these resolutions call for the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from Palestinian territory occupied since the June 1967 war, for the 4 June border effective before the outbreak of hostilities to be respected.
This is the case with Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon.
The issue has now been raised with regard to Syria.
We have also demonstrated our willingness to accept minor adjustments to borders, in the common interest, on condition that such changes are mutual in terms of value and surface area, and while stressing the international resolutions which stipulate that the activities of the Israeli settlements on Palestinian land are illegal.
We have also stated that we wish to collaborate and cooperate with the Israelis in accepting the presence of international forces at borders in order to maintain peace and security, whereas the Israeli position, on the other hand, clings to the principle of annexation. Israel wishes to annex three major settlements in the north of the West Bank, as well as the settlements in Jerusalem and its surrounding areas, in the south and in the Jordan valley, as well as other territories which will be under Israeli control, and for a specific time at that, which will split the West Bank up and leave it under Israeli control, in the final analysis.
On another security issue, Israel would like to keep its forces in the Jordan valley, at borders and at the crossing points.
This is a further factor in maintaining the division between the two parties on this subject.
I should like to address my friend and colleague, Avraham Burg, to say that Israel was created on the basis of a Security Council resolution and not on the basis of a precept in the Torah.
Consequently, if we do not respect international legitimacy, the international community will suffer from the failure of a solution to the Middle East conflict.
Ladies and gentlemen, the overwhelming majority of countries, including the European Union, have recognised the international resolutions that the Palestinian solution is based on.
You will doubtless note that the Palestinian demands to arrive at a fair and lasting solution are not extremist or intransigent, as it has suited some people to claim.
Our positions have actually been rather flexible.
What we are claiming and what we are defending is no more than the very minimum of the national Palestinian rights that have been recognised, set out and consolidated by international resolutions.
We are not asking any more than our right, but we are hoping that the decent people of the world will not give up on this either.
That it the situation up to and after Camp David.
There is still this gulf, this gap, between us, but we promise you that we shall continue with the process regardless of the problems.
Whatever the case, our strategy is peace and our objective is to work to achieve it.
We do, however, want a peace that is just, and a peace that we can defend and safeguard, a lasting peace for our children, our grandchildren and all future generations.
At this time, speaking from the rostrum of the European Parliament, sharing our problems and our future prospects, we can only express our considerable appreciation for the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation which is starting to gain ground thanks to the consolidation of economic, social, political, cultural and parliamentary relations, with a view to responding to the interests of the nations of this region.
We consider this collaboration, which benefits from your contribution, to be one of the main pillars of peace, stability and prosperity.
It is also our pleasure to express our high regard for Europe' s political and economic support for the peace plan in the region in general, and for the Palestinian people in particular, and also our appreciation of Europe' s increasing role in consolidating world peace and pushing forward the peace process in our region and throughout the world.
We sincerely hope that Europe will play an increasing part, an independent, effective, neutral and objective part.
We are very appreciative, for example, of the position which the countries of the European Union adopted at the time of the Berlin Declaration in March 1999.
Europe has always had an important role to play throughout the world.
We welcome its involvement in the Middle East peace process.
Having abandoned its colonial heritage, the unified Europe must now play a part which is in keeping with the tradition of its culture and civilisation, calling for the principles of freedom, emancipation and human rights in a free and independent country.
Madam President, in conclusion, from the rostrum of the European Parliament, let me address Mr Avraham Burg and, through him, the members of the Knesset, and the people and government of Israel, to tell them that one does not often have the opportunity to make peace and that it is an opportunity which must not, therefore, be missed.
There is not such a great price to pay for peace, so let us pay it!
We are talking about rights, justice, legitimacy and international law.
From this same rostrum, I turn to Mrs Fontaine, President of the European Parliament, and addressing all of you too, the nations and governments of Europe, I am asking you to lend us your assistance in establishing peace and respect for the foundations of the law, justice, legitimacy and international law.
Only then will you be able to assess the situation.
From this rostrum, I would also like to address my own people, the Palestinian people, to say that peace is a great battle which awaits us.
With patience we shall reach a successful conclusion.
I am confident that, with your help, we shall reach a successful conclusion.
I thank all of you, and let me convey the greetings of President Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leadership and my fellow members of the Palestinian Legislative Council, and our hopes that we will continue to receive your assistance and your support.
(Loud and sustained applause)
Thank you, Mr Ahmed Qurie, Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
for your compelling speech. I shall now give the floor to Mr Avraham Burg, Speaker of the Israeli Knesset.
Mr Burg, you have the floor.
Mr President, I would like to make what I consider to be a very important point. Yesterday, I came to Strasbourg on Olympic Airways flight 165 from Athens to Frankfurt.
When the plane arrived at Frankfurt airport, it was immediately surrounded by German police.
Nobody spoke anything but German, and we were not allowed to leave the plane without showing our passports to the German police.
I remind you that Greece, as well as Germany and France, are countries that belong to the Schengen area.
The worst thing is that this was not an exception; this, I was told, is something that happens systematically at Frankfurt airport when planes arrive from Greece.
As a Member of the European Parliament, where we have so often voted on Schengen, I believe that, although there is legislation for the free movement of people, the fact that, in reality, this legislation is being systematically violated by the German authorities is an insult to, and undermines, our work.
As this concerns the free movement of Members of the European Union, I would like the President of the European Parliament to take the appropriate measures to ensure that we come to Strasbourg in a way that befits people who belong to the European Union and to Schengen.
Mr Alavanos, I consider that our President shall forward the text of your speech to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Frankfurt airport authorities so that - and I do not know what the grounds might be for the current practice - we receive at least some sort of explanation or, alternatively, this procedure, which, I agree with you, has very little to do with the Schengen provisions, ceases to be used.
Mr President, on Monday, in my absence and without any prior notification, Mr Murphy, the leader of the British Socialist Group, raised a question about my involvement in supporting the Danish anti-euro campaign.
He was very careful not to accuse me of anything but has none the less contrived to give the impression that I am somehow under suspicion.
I should like to put on record that my involvement with the Danish referendum has been entirely separate from my work in this House and that I have never infringed any parliamentary rules.
Unlike the Danish "yes" campaign, the "no" campaign cannot rely on taxpayers' money or subsidies from the European Union.
It is outrageous that Mr Murphy should have sought to give the impression that I am under investigation when he has failed to produce evidence or even make any allegations against me.
It cannot be right for Members to be subjected to this kind of baseless innuendo.
I would ask you to insist that Mr Murphy either accuse me outright or apologise.
Mr Hannan, Mr Murphy is, of course, free to decide whether and how to respond to your speech.
Mr President, we very frequently complain about the Council's attitude towards Parliament.
I would like to highlight an incident of a completely opposite nature which took place yesterday during the debate on EU external action priorities.
We had the reports from the President of the Council and the Commissioner followed by a debate took place.
At the end of the debate, due to the presidency's total lack of flexibility, the President of the Council and Commissioner Patten were not able to respond to the numerous questions which had arisen from quite an intense debate.
Now then, I cannot understand this Parliament for complaining about the Council's behaviour.
Yesterday, the President of the Council was in the Chamber from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. while the number of Members of Parliament present was not great - and, in actual fact, we prevented both the Council or the Commission from replying to extremely important questions posed by Members.
This does not seem to me to be very polite, and I would go so far as to describe it as verging on the downright rude.
Mr Dupuis, I doubt that this situation was due to lack of flexibility on the part of the presidency on duty. It is more likely to have been a mistake, a misunderstanding between the Chair at the time and the Council and Commission representatives.
Mr President, I am very surprised at what I heard from our British fellow MEP, Mr Hannan, for he presented himself in the Danish media as a Member of the European Parliament.
If he were there as a private individual, he should have let this be known in the Danish campaign.
All things considered, I think Mr Hannan should stay at home in Britain and mind his own business, and leave us to get on with it in Denmark.
We have no use for people like that acting the fool in Denmark.
Mr President, I do not want to detain the House too long but I think that Mr Hannan protests too much!
I made a very simple request to the President on Monday.
The President agreed to my request and referred the matter to the Quaestors.
But while Mr Hannan is here in the Chamber this morning, perhaps he could give us a guarantee that he will be making a new entry in his declaration of financial interests to say where the money has come from.
The Danish people have a right to know in advance of the referendum on 28 September where the "no" campaign funds have come from.
Now then, we cannot continue with the debate and we cannot turn this Chamber into an annex to the discussion leading up to the Danish referendum either.
We now know the essence of the issue.
Everyone will do what they think best.
Right to family reunification
The next item is the report (A5-0201/2000) by Mr Watson, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification [COM(1999) 638 - C50077/2000 - 1999/0258 (CNS)]
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Klamt, who was the original rapporteur designated by the committee which I have the honour to chair to look at this issue.
Mrs Klamt did a very considerable amount of work on the proposal for a Council directive on the right to family reunification.
She deserves the credit for the work that has been done.
I wish to congratulate her on that.
I have inherited this particular cornucopia as chairman of the committee because Mrs Klamt felt at the end of the votes at committee stage that she could no longer support the text as it stood and therefore I am presenting it to the House today.
I would like to commend the European Commission on what is an extremely well argued and well presented report, drawn up in record time considering the relative lack of resources of the departments concerned and the demands laid down at the European Council in Tampere last year.
The Commission has come forward with an excellent draft directive which will permit third-country nationals legally resident in a Member State of the Union to reside in another Member State as is required if a true area of freedom, security and justice is to be established.
The Commission has said, quite rightly in my view, that the goal of zero immigration mentioned in past Community discussion was never realistic and sought instead to put forward realistic proposals for the protection of the rights of third-country nationals in accordance with the many international treaties that have been signed by Member States, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international covenants of 1966 on civil and political rights and on economic and social rights.
Very clearly, the importance of legal immigration is recognised.
The importance of the family as a unit is also recognised and the importance of making a success of the integration of third-country nationals residing lawfully in EU Member States is the whole basis of these proposals.
We have in my committee considered a number of contentious areas, not least the question of the right to bring in ascending relatives.
The Commission proposal quite clearly recognises the difference of legal treatment between descending and ascending relatives.
It is evident that, in the context of the international legal framework, mention must be made of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
This convention requires states to ensure that the child is not separated from the parents.
There is no similar convention dealing with ascending relatives, but it is clearly the case that if we wish to live up to our humanitarian ideals we must provide the opportunity for third-country nationals to bring dependent relatives in the ascending line into their family units.
This has been a matter of some debate within the committee.
I am pleased to see that a number of amendments to the final report have been put forward; in particular Amendments Nos 18 to 23, which propose a compromise on this matter.
May I briefly introduce some of the amendments that the committee's report puts forward.
Amendment No 3 looks at the need for data and recognises that in order to have an effective evaluation of the situation in the Member States, the Commission will need more information from the Member States.
Amendment No 5 deals with relatives from the ascending line.
This has now been overtaken in a sense by the compromise Amendments Nos 18 to 23.
Amendment No 6 recognises the very real problems that the administrations of the Member States currently have with the workload created by the demands of family reunification.
Amendment No 9 allows each Member State to introduce more favourable provisions than those set down in the directives, and insists that these new rules will not lower current standards of protection.
Amendment No 11 deals with the grounds on which a Member State may deny the right of entry to a relative, namely on grounds of public policy, domestic security and public health.
Our amendment seeks to insist that any Member State wishing to refuse entry on those grounds provides very clear justification.
I do not wish to comment on all of the 66 amendments put forward to my report, but I would say that this is a very complicated area.
Parliament had relatively little time to look at it and inevitably not all of the compromises which were necessary to reach a favourable outcome were achieved in committee.
I would therefore urge Members to look carefully at the amendments that have been tabled in plenary to reach the compromises which will allow us to go forward in an effective and humanitarian way.
Mr President, my task as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was a relatively easy one compared with that of the honourable members in the committee responsible, and I would like to congratulate them all on the outcome, even if we do have to discuss a few compromise amendments in plenary today.
The reason I said that my committee' s task was an easy one, is because the proposed draft directive raises few difficulties from a legal viewpoint, and nor is there a great deal of room for manoeuvre when it comes to framing policy.
I would also like to say how impressed I am with the logistical quality of the draft directive, which certainly cannot be said of all the Commission' s draft directives.
Pursuant to the new Article 63 of the EU Treaty, it is now the Community' s task to settle the matter of family reunification, and the Community must take these measures in accordance with the provisions of international law, in particular the European Convention of Human Rights and the other instruments of international law already mentioned by our committee chairman.
The right to respect for family life is a universal human right.
It is not divisible and cannot be reserved for EU citizens alone.
This would be a dubious line to take, particularly as we are concurrently working on a European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
If Community provisions are now to be put in place for family reunification, we also need to close incomprehensible and, in some cases, absurd gaps in the existing legislation.
This particularly applies to the right of EU citizens themselves to live together in their home land with family members originating from a third country and not to be in the position where the only way they can live with them as a family is to avail themselves of freedom of movement and settle in another Member States.
Therefore this directive is only too welcome from a legal viewpoint, and it is to be hoped that neither Parliament, nor, more importantly, the Council, will make any changes to the substance of the Commission' s original draft.
Mr President, in principle, everyone agrees that open internal borders make a compelling case for a pan-European, harmonised immigration and asylum policy.
The Commission has put forward the first draft of a legislative initiative in this field, which concerns the right to family reunification.
Unfortunately, it failed to place this draft directive in an overall frame of reference.
What point is there in knowing which family members have the right to enter and reside in the EU, when it is not known what provisions are to be made for which immigrant groups and for which reasons for immigration?
In addition, Parliament is expected to vote on a legislative initiative which lacks absolute fundamental principles.
We have neither a joint evaluation of demographic trends, nor do we know what impact this legislative initiative will have on the individual Member States.
Unfortunately, the lack of overall strategy and statistical basis are not the only weak points.
The Commission lumps economically motivated immigration and asylum together.
I take the view that as far as family reunification is concerned, there should be one set of arrangements for asylum seekers and refugees, and one for immigrants.
Different rules must apply to those who have been driven out of their native land than apply to those who emigrate for economic reasons.
We need to clearly distinguish between asylum seekers and refugees on the one hand, and immigration, i.e. economic migration, on the other.
This will allow for provisions that do justice to the people concerned and the situations they are in.
Many of my proposed amendments have this distinction in view.
Another problem with the present draft directive concerns the widening of the definition of family.
Grandparents, children over the age of majority and non-married partners should also be entitled to family reunification.
That is where the dilemma lies: there is no overall frame of reference for immigration.
As such, family reunification is currently the only legal channel of immigration.
The proposed sweeping provisions on family reunification are open to uncontrollable abuse.
Just ask yourselves this question: who will decide, according to which criteria, whether a relationship is bogus, contrived purely for the purposes of immigration?
That is why quite a few of my proposed amendments call for priority to be given to the core family.
Another cardinal sin committed by the Commission is that its proposal contains no measures whatsoever for integration.
It is not right to bring people to a foreign country without making the necessary provisions for foreign nationals and local people to live together in peace and friendship.
A final point to be made is that a directive of this kind is paving the way for us to have an objective and constructive discussion on the whole area of immigration.
If people feel they are being overrun by waves of immigrants, then their reaction is one of rejection.
If we put transparent, enforceable provisions in place, then people will be more inclined to allow foreign nationals to integrate.
By producing moderate and well-considered solutions, not only will we be able to overcome problems such as xenophobia; we will also be able to tackle the problems associated with having a disproportionate number of elderly people in the European Union.
However, this draft directive seems to be a poor first attempt at this.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, I am sorry to hear Mrs Klamt' s words.
I wanted to begin by congratulating the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino on this proposal which seems to me to be very complete, well constructed and timely, coming almost a year after the Tampere Summit.
We must clarify today in this Parliament whether we want the immigrants and refugees who live amongst us to do so legally with their families, giving them the opportunity to live a normal life and to integrate fully into our society, or whether we are going to continue to feed the myth that they are provisional co-citizens whose final destiny is to return to the hypothetical homes they came from.
This issue is so important that we must make an effort to reach a consensus.
All of our groups were in agreement in committee, apart from the PPE Group.
I would like us today to send a message to the people who live amongst us that they can do so with their right to live as a family recognised.
Mr President, this is the intention of my group, although I would also like to ask the Commission, on behalf of my group, to think twice about one aspect included in the current directive.
We have also applied these rules we are debating to people who are under alternative protection.
Unfortunately, the European Union does not have homogenous criteria. There is no harmonised asylum policy.
Therefore, there are very different situations in many countries, and on this minor point I would agree with Mrs Klamt.
It is not a question of rejecting these people - they have the right to live as families - but of the Commission thinking twice about it and of their being subject to a future directive which would include persons under temporary and alternative protection, while we await the future harmonisation of the Union' s asylum policy.
Otherwise, I congratulate the Commission and I hope that it receives the full support of this House.
Mr President, the ELDR Group is backing this report as one of the essential building blocks in constructing the area of freedom, security and justice and in following up the Tampere Summit, which rightly made it a priority to establish rights of free movement for legally resident third-country nationals.
This is an injustice which needs remedying.
Like Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­, I am surprised at the stance of the EPP Group, which normally puts a lot of emphasis on family values and yet today is undermining the family by opposing reunification, which will assist the social integration of these legally resident migrants.
This seems to us perverse.
To take up some specific points in the report, first of all on the inclusion of beneficiaries of subsidiary protection.
We will wait to hear Mr Vitorino, but it is rumoured that the Commission will accept amendments to take these beneficiaries out.
The ELDR Group would regret that because we think that, like refugees, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection should be in.
They are long-term residents, they are not analogous to beneficiaries of temporary protection.
We will listen to the debate because our overwhelming desire is to get the bones of this proposal through.
On ascending relatives, we consider that Amendment No 20 is superfluous because there is a general right in Article 9 of the proposal to apply a non-discriminatory means test to all entrants.
However we are willing to look at that if it assists in saving the report.
It is important to be absolutely clear on unmarried partners.
The proposal will not force Member States to give legal recognition to unmarried partnerships, but if they do they must treat unmarried partners like spouses.
There has been a lot of misinformation on this, not least stirred up by the Conservatives in the United Kingdom - tabloid headlines about outrageous plots by the EU to force the UK to accept refugees' gay lovers.
That is stirring up homophobic prejudice and I deplore it.
Mr President, we are going to vote on a report today that has caused a political stir in certain EU States.
The Commission and Commissioner Vitorino have done some sterling work here, and I would like, on behalf of my group, to take the opportunity to thank them for it.
The European Council confirmed, at its special summit in Tampere, that the European Union must ensure that third-country nationals are treated fairly.
The Commission has taken this resolution forward.
This directive is conclusive as it stands, and should be transposed with all haste.
Sadly there were, and still are, reservations against including refugees benefiting from temporary protection in this directive, and against recognising same-sex relationships as the basis for family reunification.
This debate demonstrates once again that, unfortunately, integration and migration policy is still a controversial issue in the European Union.
There is, after all, a great deal to be considered.
Nevertheless, we must make it possible for people who live apart from relatives who are third-country nationals, to be brought together.
Therefore, in principle, this is an initiative that deserves everyone' s support, particularly where it concerns children, and these self-same children - irrespective of whether they are the offspring of refugees or immigrants - should have a future in the European Union.
However, opinion is being stirred up against this directive in the political arena.
It is to be hoped that the majority of honourable members will support the directive put forward by the Commission as it stands.
I know that my fellow socialist members are awaiting a statement from Mr Vitorino, in the hope that refugees' interests will be sacrificed for the sake of this directive, under pressure from quite a number of EU Ministers for Home Affairs.
I regret this decision, and the fact that Ministers for Home Affairs appear to carry more weight in this Parliament than the honourable members, who are expected to act according to their consciences.
For this reason, I reiterate my call for us to support the Commission' s directive and at last set down a marker for an up-to-date, modern and humane policy of integration.
I hope the Socialists will refrain from making this deal with the Conservatives.
Mr President, I would like to commend the Commission on its serious and balanced work. Too often, when we broach the subject of immigration, passions, excesses and political ulterior motives prevent us from reflecting objectively and making progress.
In dealing in depth with the issue of the right to live as a family, and in defining the precise conditions for its application, the text enables us to hold a real debate.
Far from casting suspicion a priori, as is often the case, on those who wish to live with their spouses and children, the text recognises the legitimacy of such a right even if, in fact, this right must now apply equally to homosexual couples and to all other categories, as the honourable Member has just said, especially in the case of asylum seekers.
The text also takes into account that nowadays there are several types of families in our society, especially certain forms of cohabitation, and that we cannot therefore discriminate against immigrants who live in the same way.
In recognising this, the text helps to give real meaning to the term 'integration' .
Through harmonising legislation in Member States, this draft directive will provide protection and legal stability for immigrants and will above all prevent them from being subjected to national political fluctuations.
I therefore hope that subsequent work by the Commission and Parliament will take its inspiration from this example.
Perhaps we will then be able to talk further on the equality of rights and the often positive contribution made by immigration, in dealing with issues that are vital for integration and the fight against the unemployment, insecure employment, violence and discrimination, of which immigrants are often victim.
Immigration is not a problem.
Yet we must resolve to talk about the real problems such as the imbalances between the North and the South that often force men and women to flee from poverty.
We must also recognise that the waves of immigrants towards the countries of the European Union have been more or less constant for a couple of decades.
In other words, by implementing restrictive laws, Member States have not succeeded in reducing the overall number of entrants; they have simply reduced the number of legal immigrants while increasing the numbers of illegal immigrants by declaring them illegal.
By underpinning these values, this draft directive will not only have positive consequences for immigrants and their families, but it will also be a symbol for refuge and integration.
I sincerely hope that we will be able to follow the same line of conduct in subsequent work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the text that has been presented to us, and in fact the entire immigration policy that is being pursued by European institutions, exhibits a worrying trend.
Indeed, there would be cause to worry about a certain form of capitalism that imports workers and cuts them off from their families, with all the risks of rootlessness that could give rise to. But today we have gone well beyond that.
What were initially nothing more than a temporary work contracts are tending to turn into permanent residence.
What has become permanent for one person is tending to become permanent for that person' s family and friends.
Initially it was just the close family, but now it is the extended family as well. And we are very well aware that the extended family is extensive, given the social structures of the countries of origin, in which the registration of births, marriages and deaths is sometimes only rather ad hoc.
And then, from the extended family - brothers, cousins, nephews, parents, grand parents - we move on to the polygamous family.
And why favour just family ties? From the polygamous family, we move on to cohabitation and soon, as the preceding speaker, Mr Sylla, has just proposed, we will move on to mere homosexual association.
These are the considerable risks resulting from this policy trend.
We are going to end up with what we are already starting to witness; a veritable, suicidal immigration of entire populations, organised by Member States and European institutions alike.
This is, quite manifestly, the suicide of Europe.
The only solution worthy of the name is to organise family reunification but to organise it in the country of origin with the support of the policy of cooperation to which end these methods should be employed.
Mr President, whilst expressing my continued dismay at the ongoing prejudice shown towards Austria by the 14 other Member States, I have this to say about the report currently under discussion. I regret the way in which it was handled in the committee responsible, as this has led to the rapporteur being unable, in the final analysis, to identify with the outcome, causing her to withdraw her name.
A rather singular occurrence. As I see it, constructive and well-founded amendments proposed by the rapporteur - which she has expounded and justified again today, and which I am therefore in a position to refer to - as well as by other members of the committee, were simply swept aside and not handled properly, for reasons of political ideology.
In assessing this improper conduct, I would refer - on behalf of Austria, among others - to the decision taken by the conference of the heads of provincial governments on 17 May 2000, whereby all the new Austrian heads of the provincial governments rejected the draft directive in this form, unanimously and in fact right across the political divide.
I am sorry that the committee has behaved in this way, because I believe a sledgehammer approach does the cause more harm than good, particularly in an area as sensitive as this.
Mr President, Commissioner, the present document, like the report, is a labelling con.
The wording on the outside belies the actual contents of these documents.
We would be delighted to endorse family reunification measures, for this would be deeply humane and would also be key to an integration component, but what we have is something entirely different.
This is about initiating sociopolitical debate on how far the circle of those entitled to family reunification can be extended beyond the core family.
You include a proposal relating to unmarried partners, whose parents and children would be allowed to join them, according to which, testimonies from the country of origin would be enough to satisfy you as to the authenticity of a relationship, regardless as to how it appears.
This would mean that children or parents joining members here would have the same rights as EU citizens in the educational, employment and social spheres.
The traffickers in human beings and the document forgers will thank those of you who support this proposal, and you can rest assured that the general public' s response will be one of indignation.
You also include a proposal relating to multiple marriages, i.e. the first wife is to be accepted along with the children and relatives in the ascending line. However, you also make the point in this document that naturally it would be possible to bring another wife and her dependants in, if this were necessary for the sake of the child' s welfare.
This begs the question as to how much wider the door is to be opened to uncontrollable immigration?
As far as we are concerned, the proposal under discussion is unacceptable.
It lacks an overall frame of reference, a statistical basis and there is no differentiation. You are also overstepping the mark in respect of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which requires the integration capacity of each of the Member States to be taken into account.
We have no intention of voting for this document unless it includes our amendments and follows our political line.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, after the recent events in Dover, when 29 illegal Chinese immigrants suffocated to death, the tragedy of illegal immigration and the methods of responding to it have become a considerable problem, which the European Union must definitely tackle.
This problem requires us to work on a particularly sensitive issue, that of shaping and harmonising a European immigration policy. This will be one of the major issues of the twenty-first century.
The European Commission' s draft directive establishing the right to family reunification is perfectly timed, and I would like to congratulate the Commission particularly on this text, which was drawn up under the auspices of Commissioner Vitorino.
The right to family reunification is crucial to normal family life. What is more, this right has long existed in the form of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, according to which all persons have the right to family life.
But this is a particularly sensitive issue in view of the different laws existing in the various Member States, as it can come into conflict with notions of sovereignty. But that is the gauntlet that has been thrown down to the European Parliament, which must succeed in transcending these differences.
The draft directive we are being asked to give our opinion on today is, in my view, a text of major importance, and it must receive the firm backing of the European Parliament. This text holds out real prospects for legal immigration, most of which is family immigration.
As has already been said, this directive is the first example of this type of structure resulting from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council, which is why it is so important.
I would also like to point out that the modern world has many advantages, but for certain categories of people, including foreigners, there is a significant risk of exclusion. It is our duty as European democrats to be particularly diligent in this matter.
The directive proposed by the Commission enables us to take a major step forward, under conditions that are entirely satisfactory, but with all the necessary guarantees.
There has never been any question of authorising polygamous family groupings, contrary to what I have just heard.
This is utterly false.
Let us remember that this is the first text in the process of integrating the 'justice and internal affairs' pillar into community policy in the wake of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere European Council last November.
Let us also remember that this is no more and no less than a matter of establishing the right to family reunification and that we must stop seeing family reunification as a privilege.
As far as we are concerned, what is at stake is the construction of a Citizens' Europe, something we are hoping and praying for in order to be able to continue to build Europe.
It is up to us to seize this opportunity. Otherwise we will not succeed.
Mr President, I am of the firm opinion that this draft directive is a major step forward.
That said, restrictive conditions are still being placed on the process of family reunification.
I believe we should be highlighting the fact that, in the final analysis, it is unemployment and insecure employment that should be banned and not the right of immigrants to live with their families only if they can provide evidence of adequate means and a roof over their head.
For the nationals of a country, society makes progress slowly, but it does make progress, witness the PACS vote in France, but the notion of the family in the case of immigrants is inflexible.
The laws in force provide for the right of residence to be revoked if there is a break-up in the matrimonial household, effectively outlawing divorce, and, as has just been said, homosexual couples are still not recognised.
Under the pretext of combating polygamy, second spouses and their children are condemned to illegality and to even greater dependence.
Family reunification must be liberated from the archaic conditions that still exist as a result of fanatical immigration control.
In conclusion, Mr Watson' s report has fortunately made real progress following the work in committee on the initial report by Mrs Klamt.
I am bound to say that, when I hear Mr Gollnisch' s racist, reactionary and unacceptable comments, I want to vote for this report. It is a question of dignity.
Mr President, contrary to popular belief and notwithstanding the debate that has taken place here this morning, this directive is not about defining the concept of family, which is generally binding throughout the European Union.
It has far more to do with establishing in precise terms, which third-country family members should be entitled to join relations who are immigrants to the European Union.
No one would dispute the fact that families have the right to live together.
But what really matters here is where we draw the line as regards family members.
For example, I have a wife and two children, and they have children too. I also have siblings and aunts and uncles.
If I were to count the number of relatives I live in close contact with, that makes 25 all told.
Commissioner Vitorino, if I were to apply for asylum in Portugal, for example, then clearly I would be unable to assert a claim to live there with 25 relatives.
In other words, we must be sensible and draw the line somewhere.
That is the crucial problem we face with this directive.
We must also distinguish between those whose stay in the European Union subject to a time limit, and those who reside here permanently.
I should point out that this draft directive extends family reunification provisions beyond those that have been in force in the Member States to date.
This sends out another signal to would-be immigrants, which will, of course, have major consequences.
This directive would have very different implications for States with a high proportion of immigrants, such as Austria, Germany and the Benelux States, than it would for States such as Portugal, Finland and others, which do not see very much in the way of immigration.
We cannot endorse this directive as matters stand, because it would lead to a dramatic increase in family reunification, which is one of the main grounds for reunification.
Therefore, Commissioner, with all due respect for your work, I cherish the hope that the Council will decline to give it the unanimous assent it requires.
Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly congratulating the European Commission and especially Commissioner Vitorino, on its extremely constructive legislative proposal on the issue of family reunification.
At last, Europe is on the move, after decades of zero immigration and, more especially, after so many years of refusal by Europeans to grant third-country nationals residing lawfully in the European Union their fundamental human rights.
Recognising the right to family life is one of the basic conditions for the integration of refugees and migrants in the social life of the country in which they reside.
Unfortunately, those in this Parliament who extol the virtues of the family and hold it up as the highest ideal happen to be the very people who undermine it. This is exactly what is happening with this draft directive on the reunification of the families of refugees and migrants.
Self-righteous hypocrisy is the main feature of this wing of the European Parliament, and we have experienced it again and again.
Yet I would like to say that I understand the qualms of many governments, including my own, concerning this draft directive.
Indeed, countries such as Germany, where millions of refugees and migrants have sought refuge, are shouldering an enormous burden.
But at the same time I would like to point out and to highlight the enormous contribution that refugees and migrants make to the economic development of our countries, through their work and through taxation.
The social burden that is referred to by the critics of the proposal may be reduced if refugees and their family members have the right to work, as provided for by the Commission proposal
Finally, I would like to point out that this directive sets out the minimum requirements, and governments retain the right to put in place better conditions for the reunification of families.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in my career as a Member of the European Parliament, I am happy in the certain knowledge that the Council will give Parliament 's misguided and dangerous opinion the consideration it deserves, i.e. none at all!
Commissioner Vitorino, although I hold you in high regard - and have said as much on many occasions in this House - the Commission document itself is shot through with negligent ignorance as to the situation in the very Member States that have been generous enough to accord large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers the right to protection and hospitality over the past few years.
You ask too much of our society, and in so doing, run the risk of creating a breeding ground for something that we have always fought against in this House.
The liberal and social democrat delegates from the large Member States - because so far today, I have only heard speakers of this political persuasion from the small Member States - must ask themselves whether they are remotely in touch with the electorate, whether they are aware of the consequences, and whether they have grasped that more authority for Parliament in these matters would also bring increased responsibility.
The age is past when we could hold forth here on our dreams for making the world a better place, without repercussions.
I would be very interested to see how you intend to justify today' s decision to your electorate.
Many of you will only vote in favour of this proposal today because you know full well that the Council will never endorse it as it stands.
I feel this is unworthy of you.
