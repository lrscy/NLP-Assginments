Regrettably, I must tell you that the first part of the study, devoted to parallel trade, which has now been completed, shows that such trade poses considerable risks to patient safety.
Several factors are to blame, including mistakes in repackaging or relabelling, the limited effect of product recalls, the more complex distribution channels, supply interruptions and, finally, shortcomings in the enforcement of applicable legal provisions.
The Commission is currently analysing the findings of the study with a view to developing a coherent strategy for the elimination of these safety risks.
The various political options are being examined for their foreseeable social, economic and environmental impact.
Given the significant implications of this issue for public health policy, the Commission gives it high priority.
Decisions on where we go from here will be taken shortly.
I should also like to inform you that the European Pharmaceutical Forum offers a platform for easier adoption and sharing of good practices with regard to the pricing of medicines and reimbursement of the cost of medicines.
Although these matters fall within the purview of the Member States, the relevant measures still have to be consistent with Community law.
The work of the Pharmaceutical Forum, in which patient organisations, members of the medical profession and leading figures in the industry as well as the Ministers of Health of all the Member States are represented, can help to resolve the major issue of affordable access to safe medicines.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your response, which is clear but alarming, because obviously there are problems about safety.
I would like you to outline the timeframe which will apply to your response, because I think people are not generally aware how at risk they might be from counterfeit medicines.
And could I ask you - in writing, perhaps - to address an issue which is of concern in Ireland in relation to vaccines which were legitimate vaccines but which damaged children and for which people are still waiting for some form of compensation after 40 years?
Perhaps you could write to me stating how other Member States are handling that contentious issue.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) I shall gladly do so.
In answer to your first question, let me say that I have already decided that parallel trade in counterfeit medicines will be treated as a matter of priority.
I have amended the workplan of the Directorate-General, and we shall be making legislative proposals during the current year. I believe that can be done shortly after the summer recess.
As for your other question, I am grateful for your recognition that I cannot answer it without prior examination.
I shall have that examination carried out, and you will receive the requested written answer in the coming days.
- (LT) I would like to ask about prices.
In Germany, nasal drops cost 1.5-2 times less than the same medicine costs in Lithuania.
We take care to ensure that all countries, even the developing ones, have access to medicine.
Could we take care to ensure that our citizens, EU citizens, pay at least a similar price for the same medicine?
Could we do anything here in Europe?
(ES) Madam President, health services form a recurring topic in European Parliament debates.
Each time we discuss the Services Directive there is a bid to include them in it, a bid which we have hitherto opposed, and health services have remained outside its scope.
The supply of medication is a health service.
There are some States, such as the Spanish State, which have an established group of sites - pharmacies - which are the only places where medicines may be dispensed.
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, as part of the investigation carried out by the Commission, any differences have been noted between States where pharmacies are a restricted, monitored trade and the others, with regard to the counterfeiting of medicines and inferior quality.
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, the Commission has to date been managing the problem of carbon dioxide emissions due to its activities, through the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, better known as EMAS, and has been complying with the rules of that scheme.
Since 2005, the Commission has been enforcing EMAS in five of the departments in Brussels and in eight of its buildings.
During this time, it has recorded a clear reduction in the growth rate in consumption of, amongst other things, electricity by those departments, a development which is undoubtedly positive.
Overall CO2 emission reduction targets have not yet been set for the Commission, but within the framework of EMAS, the Commission is examining and analysing the total volume of its CO2 emissions, and will set overall emission reduction targets within the year 2008.
In particular, as regards its vehicle fleet, the Commission has already set a target of reducing CO2 emissions by an average of 26% between 2006 and 2012.
The Commission will be making some major announcements on Wednesday, and I expect that people everywhere will be asking then whether we practise what we preach.
So to hear that only five DGs have currently signed up to EMAS is not very encouraging, although I cannot say that Parliament can claim to be much better.
It would certainly fail such a test, although action is now being taken to address the issue.
Does the Commissioner accept that his arguments in favour of the 'big picture changes' that must be made by Member States if we are to tackle climate change could be undermined if the Commission is not seen to be acting on the fine detail - on its own implementation of these improvements?
Member of the Commission. - Yes, I agree with you.
We should practise what we preach, and this is what we are going to do in 2008.
I expect the Commission and its services will target a reduction in emissions to at least the same level as we are requesting of the Member States.
As you know, we have set a 30% reduction target, provided that other developed countries follow, or a 20% target if they do not sign up to an international agreement on reducing emissions.
We will set ourselves the 30% target, and I expect that, in so doing, we will show by example that we mean what we are asking others to do.
By the way, we will have to conduct a study to determine the exact quantity of emissions from the Commission, before setting targets and a timetable, and also establishing an action plan to combat emissions.
(DE) There is something I would be interested to know.
We have this 30% reduction target imposed from the top down, and it does seem to be widely endorsed.
As you quite rightly said, others must follow suit if these targets are to be achieved.
My own question to you is this: do you yourself have a plan for achieving this 30% reduction personally in your own sphere of activity?
(DE) As we know, the European Parliament has set a reduction target of 30% by 2012 on the basis of EMAS, and we are keen to see what specific measures are adopted by the European Parliament and its decision-makers.
Commissioner, you said that the application of EMAS would mean less electricity consumption.
It would interest me to know what specific measures have been taken, what specific measures are planned for the coming years, and what role renewables are to play.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is concerned about privacy and security problems in the information society, in particular when these put consumers at risk.
The use of spam, spyware and malicious software is in clear breach of the European privacy legislation, and in some cases it is even a criminal offence.
This is why we need vigorous enforcement by competent authorities.
Last December, Commissioner Reding (whom I have the pleasure to replace here) welcomed the fast and effective intervention by the Dutch regulator, which imposed a fine totalling EUR 1 million on three Dutch enterprises for illegally installing 'spyware' and 'adware' on more than 22 million computers in the Netherlands and elsewhere.
She has called upon other regulators to follow this example.
On 13 November 2007 the Commission adopted its proposals on the Telecom Reform, which include provisions that further strengthen the security and privacy regime underpinning the information society.
In relation to spam, the proposals introduced the possibility for internet service providers to take legal action against spammers.
This provision is expected to become an important tool in the fight against spam in Europe.
Also, the effectiveness of anti-spam enforcement will be strengthened by including this in the scope of the Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation, which provides for a network of public enforcement authorities throughout the Community and a minimum level of investigation and enforcement powers to apply this regulation effectively.
More generally, the proposals include the provision for customers of electronic communication services to be informed of possible actions that a service provider may take to address security threats, or in response to a security or integrity incident.
By introducing the concept of breach notifications, users of electronic communication services would be told about breaches of security when this has resulted in personal data being lost or compromised, and about precautions that they may take in order to minimise the economic loss or social harm that could result from a security breach.
To ensure compliance with these requirements, national regulatory authorities will be given the power to issue binding instructions to operators on the measures that are required to secure electronic communication networks and services and to oversee proper implementation.
The proposed European Electronic Communications Market Authority will have as one of its core tasks network and information security and will assist the Commission in implementing measures on a European level where appropriate.
Thank you, Commissioner, for that comprehensive answer.
I do not know what the digital equivalent of 'epidemic' is, but following this Christmas season we now see an epidemic of this kind of behaviour.
All the independent organisations have said that.
I do not want to belittle anything the Commission has done; I think it has made this a priority.
What I would ask, though, is that examples like the Dutch example of encouraging prosecutions, encouraging ISPs to be free to go after these people - none of this, I feel, is coming back to consumers.
Is there something simple that the Commission can issue for MEPs, to tell our consumers what you are doing and how effectively this is being measured?
Vice-President of the Commission. - I could not agree more.
I have already said that proposals are in place and are currently under consideration by Parliament and the Council.
I expect these to enter into force, and we will then have all the necessary requirements in place.
The current legal situation allows action to be taken against such violations, although this depends on the case.
In the case of a criminal offence, people can ask for the support of the police, or can take other legal action.
As I have already mentioned, the example set by the Dutch regulator OPTA has been welcomed by the Commission in a press release.
I have the full text here.
If you wish, I can hand it to you after Question Time so you can read what we have already done.
(EL) Madam President, the Commissioner Mr Reding is absent, of course, but I am sure the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, has sufficient breadth of knowledge to answer my question on a supplementary matter: whether the Commission has evidence or clues linking the source of unsolicited e-mails - spam - to the companies offering services and products for protection against such unwanted intrusions.
I would like to connect the first question by Ms McGuinness on protecting consumers from counterfeit and sub-standard medicines with the question by Mr Moraes on protecting consumers against spam.
One of the huge problems I, like most others, have is the amount of medicines advertised in spam, along with all sorts of products that enhance all sorts of bits of the body which some of us do not even possess!
I wonder, with reference to the parallel market study you referred to, if there are any studies under way on the whole issue of the internet, spam and counterfeit medicines, and in particular on sub-standard medicines that offer no guarantee of safety or efficacy for consumers and patients everywhere.
There is horrific growth in that particular area.
Member of the Commission. - The first results of the product safety stocktaking were released on 22 November 2007.
These indicate that the regulatory framework is fit for the purpose, if properly applied and when properly applied.
The Rapex system is working efficiently to ensure that dangerous products are recalled from the market throughout the European Union.
The stocktaking report nonetheless identifies scope for improvements, both in preventive actions and in international cooperation, such as enhanced enforcement.
Some envisaged improvements are already at an advanced stage towards becoming concrete actions, notably as concerns the revision of the Toy Safety Directive.
The Commission is also in the process of preparing a temporary measure requiring warnings on magnetic toys, pending revision of the standards, to address the risk those toys could pose.
The Commission is assisting the Member States' market surveillance authorities to identify and share best practices with a view to improved controls.
In October 2007, Member States reported on initiatives for better cooperation with economic operators and on specific surveillance campaigns on toys.
The Commission intends to publish comparative enforcement capacity data in the consumer scoreboard for 2008, in what is a new and, I hope, very helpful initiative.
The Commission also continues to concretely reinforce the market surveillance capacity of the Member States by participating in the financing of well-designed joint market surveillance projects.
Those projects received EUR 1.3 million in Community funding in 2007.
In addition to actions to improve protection within the EU, various actions are under way to strengthen protection at borders.
Recent major changes to EU customs legislation will assist in identifying high risk consignments for controls.
Secure customs exchange mechanisms will also enable rapid action to be taken when information becomes available on new types of dangerous products.
Information available in the Rapex system will be distributed using this mechanism, in order to alert the competent customs authorities of specific, potentially dangerous cargos.
The Commission also agrees that traceability is an issue for further improvements.
Statistics show that products of unknown origin notified through Rapex were, for the first time, down to 3% in October 2007, as compared to 17% in 2006.
The Commission is currently analysing, with the help of the Member States, how to ensure that this improvement is not only temporary, and how to make it sustainable.
The Commission has already included, in the legislation under the internal market for goods package, a provision requiring economic operators to have available the identity of their supplier.
This should be helpful for market surveillance intervention once that legislation enters into force.
The Commission has also asked what China could do about traceability, and welcomes the initiatives taken in China to require bar coding, at factory level, of certain categories of high risk products.
Finally, the Commission has highlighted the responsibility of the economic operators concerned, and welcomes the commitment from industry to work on measures to build consumer confidence, in particular through what we are calling a 'safety pact'.
The Commission will also send experts to carry out a study of business safety measures in the supply chain, and will report further on this in the first quarter of 2008.
(FR) Thank you for your response, Commissioner: I am glad that the Commission intends to take a series of measures to reduce, in so far as possible, the risks associated with the circulation of imported toys, particularly those from China.
One important aspect here, which the Commission has highlighted, is the traceability of toys from producer to consumer - and you did refer briefly to that in your reply.
A major question remains unanswered, however.
In the event of hundreds of thousands of toys being withdrawn from the market, as happened last year, can you tell me please, Commissioner, what becomes of those toys?
What proof do you have that they are removed absolutely from the market?
I have heard reports - which prompted me to ask my question today - that they are being put back onto the market, for sale to other children.
All children, throughout the world, are entitled to benefit from the same approach on our part: I think none of us will argue with that.
Does the traceability system enable you to follow these toys all the way to their destruction?
Member of the Commission. - I think that your question is absolutely valid and very humane.
We have to pursue our goal: these dangerous toys must not reach not just the European market, which is our duty, but any market, and we have some well-developed tools to help us.
We can conduct a market surveillance, we have controls and our Rapex system, which is a system through which we can get information through the market and not only when the dangerous goods are stopped at our borders.
However, what is also important for us as a global leader in the safety process is not to allow these dangerous goods - especially toys - to reach other children - in China as well.
It is not enough just to preach for the safety of European kids, which is part of our duty.
I have asked the main producers several times openly and clearly to destroy the toys and I have also invited them to the Commission in Brussels, where we discussed how to ensure that the toys are destroyed.
They all committed to this.
In particular, I urged Mattel, as the major industry with more recalls than any other, to comply, and it has agreed to this obligation.
It is not legally binding: I cannot make them destroy their factories.
But I think we are facing a time when the legislative framework is just a framework and there are things that are beyond and outside the framework.
We need to vigorously pursue measures that are above the absolutely necessary from a legislative point of view.
I had an opportunity to discuss this issue with UNICEF and the Americans during the TACD dialogue.
I am fully aware of your concerns and, believe me, I will not spare efforts to make it public and to pursue the goal of destroying these toys.
Nevertheless, I do not have a legislative base outside Europe.
(DE) Commissioner, you have indicated that a great deal is being done to remove dangerous toys from the market.
That is an important step.
The fact is, however, that some of these products are being marketed here with generally recognised certification marks, including in some cases the familiar CE mark.
Under any rules of good practice, if a toy is not demonstrably safe or is actually dangerous, such labelling is not only abusive but downright fraudulent.
Is there scope to envisage criminal prosecution in such cases?
Thank you, Commissioner, for your detailed response.
In relation to Ireland, one item purchased there over the Christmas period actually exploded, and the name of the manufacturer was not identifiable.
Is it possible to have legislation introduced in all countries to make it illegal to sell an item on which the manufacturer is not clearly identifiable?
I think that is the way forward, and I would ask if that could be done.
Member of the Commission. - I know that this question is very important, and I would like to assure you that the Commission does not monitor shops during periods of higher consumption, nor does it collaborate with the national consumer organisations on this specific question.
So we very much rely on national efforts.
However, the Commission does intend to improve its tools for monitoring the functioning of the internal market from a consumer perspective.
The single market review set out the Commission's plans for a consumer scoreboard and for more detailed price monitoring, but I would like especially to stress that this is about monitoring.
Published Eurostat data show that prices of milk, cheese and eggs in Greece are 38% higher than the average prices of the same group for the European Union.
The average prices for this product group over the period 1996-2007 grew by almost 52% in Greece and only by 24% in the EU.
However, this development appears to be structural rather than seasonal.
Since 2005 the prices of dairy products for Greece do not appear to reveal seasonal fluctuations.
(EL) Madam President, I would like to say thank you very much to the Commissioner, and thank you very much for the information.
I shall also consult Eurostat so that we can see the whole scoreboard, because it is significant, of course, and important for my country - which you have mentioned - but I believe there are similar situations in other countries and it would therefore be interesting to see how your Commission is going to handle this issue generally.
Either with a recommendation or with a Directive which will cover all products and not only consumables.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission is undertaking measures at different levels aimed at reducing increases in food prices.
One initiative is to begin monitoring prices, which I mentioned earlier.
This is one of the objectives of the consumer market scoreboard on which we are working and which I believe will be supported by the Commission pretty soon.
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures within the framework of agricultural policy.
A reduction of obligatory set-aside land, already in force for the 2008 crop season; an increase in milk quotas for the year 2008-2009 adopted by the Commission and proposed to the Council, if adopted, will be in force from 1 April 2008 onwards, and a reduction of import duties in the cereals sector to reduce increases in cereal prices and also in the future of the price of meat.
This measure came into force from the beginning of January 2008.
This is a kind of inventory of what we have done.
But, through the consumer market scoreboard, one of the main topics of our investigations will be prices and part of this basket will be about food prices.
So we will duly inform you; we will consult as to what the next step will be after the data monitoring and we can take action to see what is behind this - of course, hand in hand with the national authorities.
It is interesting that when food prices are rising, the Commission will act to look at it and I would urge the Commission to come up with statistics that show us the share-out of the final retail price between producer - and I mean farmers - and consumer, because that information is not available.
I think that it is also fair to say, on the record, that the era of relatively low food prices is over and that I think that the Commission should not fool people by saying that we are going to go back to lower food prices.
Perhaps what we need to do is to educate people about buying quality food at a fair price.
- (LT) Last summer, prices started rising in all EU Member States.
We then raised the question of whether there were any cartel agreements.
In my country, Lithuania, it was found that milk processing companies agreed on raising prices.
Now the meat sector is being scrutinised.
Are such studies carried out in other EU countries?
Now a new term has appeared - 'the end of cheap food'.
Don't representatives of the food industry use this new term, and how can consumers protect themselves?
Member of the Commission. - The price of food fluctuates because of the seasonal character of agricultural production.
Those fluctuations are not completely passed on to consumers because the cost of raw materials has, until recently, been decreasing and because of warehousing technologies catering for those seasonal shortages. Recently, more systematic food price increases seem to be taking place, and the principal reason seems to be growing demand from emerging large economies, like China and India.
We have already discussed the fact that in India last year there were five million more people with a new diet that is based much more on milk, milk products and meat.
Last summer the situation worsened owing to adverse climatic conditions in many producing regions, and this has been the main reason for the exceptionally high increase in food prices in the European Union since September 2007.
The Commission and the national competition authorities are carefully monitoring the market.
Anti-competitive practices have been discovered in the dairy sector in the United Kingdom and in Greece, and fines have been imposed on firms involved in those anti-competitive practices.
I feel that, if the Latvian national authorities have been informed, then they will be working on the case you mention, especially as it is high on the public agenda.
What we really need is a sectoral investigation to see whether there is any kind of cartel behind it, which has already happened in two EU countries.
Member of the Commission. - I would like to thank the Honourable Member for her interest in the single market review.
Alongside our Communication on the single market for 21st century Europe, we adopted a package of measures to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of retail financial services markets.
Integral to that package are initiatives to improve consumer confidence and empower them to seek out the best product for their individual needs.
Although the Commission focus on empowering consumers is not recent, current financial turbulence certainly highlights the importance of this matter.
I would like to address all three areas mentioned by the Honourable Member: education, inclusion and redress.
Financial education is best delivered as close as possible to the citizens that need it, namely at the level of national and regional authorities, non-governmental agencies and the financial services sector.
At the end of 2007, we adopted a communication on financial education to raise awareness of the need to increase consumers' level of financial literacy, promote the provision of high-quality financial education in the European Union and provide some practical tools to help achieve these goals.
It includes some principles to guide financial services providers and announces some practical initiatives.
These range from publishing an on-line database of financial education provision and research in the EU, to an enhancement of the existing Dolceta on-line educational tool to help teachers incorporate financial matters into the school curriculum.
Today, having a bank account is a prerequisite for being able to fully participate in social and economic life, and all EU citizens should have access to a basic bank account.
We are currently carrying out a study to identify and analyse policy measures taken by Member States to prevent financial exclusion.
Based on this information, which we hope to receive at the end of this month, we will reflect on how best to ensure that all EU citizens have access to a basic bank account.
Finally, when buying financial services, consumers need to know that in the event of a problem they can have easy access to redress.
While out-of-court dispute settlement bodies exist in many EU countries, not all of these are members of the Commission-run FIN-NET, the aim of which is to facilitate consumer access to redress in cross-border cases.
With this in mind, we are working to ensure that all existing out-of-court dispute resolution bodies are part of FIN-NET.
We are also reflecting more generally on how to encourage the creation of alternative redress systems where these do not already exist.
Those initiatives will not create confidence and empower consumers overnight, but they are a complement to the initiatives we are taking in other related areas, such as information and advice.
(DE) I appreciate that Mr McCreevy has a tight schedule, but others have pressing engagements too.
I merely wanted to ask whether or not my question to Mrs Kuneva will still be heard, in other words whether I can go to my Group meeting now or whether I should wait here.
It is unlikely that we will get to your question.
It is regrettable that we are in the situation we are in.
Your question will almost certainly be answered in writing.
Commissioner, I want to ask you a little bit more about financial education, which is the new buzzword.
I think you will agree that there is a real imbalance in power between financial institutions and consumers, not least because, firstly, consumers need access to credit, and, secondly, regardless of the level of financial education, how many people are going to read the 25-page document that accompanies, for example, their insurance policy, and refer to it every year?
You said that this issue needs to be addressed at local and regional level, but would you not agree there needs to be greater cooperation between the major stakeholders, such as financial regulators, governments, consumer organisations and financial complaints bodies so that, working together, they can highlight some of the problems and issues, and at least act as an early warning system for the consumer?
Member of the Commission. - What we have been attempting to do here in financial education is to get this on the agenda and to make everybody aware, particularly in Member States, that it would probably be a better investment than in lots of other areas if, from a very early stage in the school curriculum, some basic financial literacy was taught.
Because, going through life, whether one ends up as the chief financial controller of a major institution or whether one has a very ordinary job in one's local area, you are definitely going to encounter - at some stage you are going to have to deal with - some major financial transaction such as the buying of a car, a house, a washing machine or whatever.
I think that from an early stage it would be far better if people had a little bit taught to them in the school curriculum programme so that they would know some basic information.
What Ms Harkin was speaking about goes on to a higher level as to what type of information should be given to a consumer, because she is correct: the amount of information that is given to them and the 48 pages that they get to read in very small writing is there for the sole purpose, in my view (and it has always been my view), of satisfying lawyers, so that if there is a case, they can charge bigger and bigger fees for telling you that you have either won or lost.
I have absolutely no faith in that at all.
Some of that particular area is directly under my own responsibility.
I often recall a particular case when I was in Scotland about two years or so ago, meeting with some of the financial educators who were talking about the Perspectives Directive in the UCITS area.
They said there were 81 pages in the Perspectives Directive and 78 pages in the simplified perspectives to do with a particular product.
So, in the Consumer Credit Directive, which I think is being dealt with at present in Parliament, Ms Kuneva will make some improvements as to what type of basic information consumers should be given.
Ms Kuneva is dealing with those particular aspects.
But in the whole area of financial education, the place where I have been trying to up the agenda is for Member States to include, from an early stage, some basic financial education as part of the core curriculum programme.
I think everybody would be far better off doing it like that than having pages and pages of small type that no one ever reads.
(DE) Commissioner, I am sure you are right when you call for a start to be made at the level of school education in order to put consumers in a better position (a) to know their rights and (b) to exercise them.
The problem, however, is that we still have a generation, indeed more than one generation, of people who think differently, who have heard that financial services and the financial market are subject to particularly stringent government supervision and who act on that knowledge, believing they can rely on such government supervision.
In actual fact, much has changed in recent times as a result of market deregulation.
Are there not perhaps one or two things that can yet be done in the realm of state supervision?
Madam President, could I suggest to the Commissioner that, not only does the information satisfy lawyers, but it bamboozles consumers?
And that is why it is there.
Like a lot of information, it is like the instructions for the washing machine.
We read it when it breaks down and it is too late.
Could I suggest you look at the role of credit unions in educating consumers, because I think that is an issue in Ireland in particular?
And, can I gently remind you, as you mentioned redress, of the absolute lack of redress for Equitable Life policyholders.
I am sure that Ms Wallis will support me on this and perhaps in a quiet moment you might come back to us with a written response as to what has happened since our report was voted on and supported by you.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission does not keep consolidated records of the number of European investment firms or the number of investment firms in Greece.
However, Member States are required by MiFID to keep a record of all investment firms registered within their territory.
The Hellenic Capital Market Commission should therefore be able to supply the data for Greek companies.
With MiFID, the trading monopolies for exchanges have been abolished, investment firms have better access to providing their services across the European Economic Area using the MiFID passport and consumer protection has been strengthened.
This leads to increased competition across borders and between trading venues, which will in turn increase liquidity and the depth of the financial markets, for the benefit of both the industry and consumers.
Our expectation that cost of capital would decline is based on a rigorous study carried out by London Economics in 2002.
This study modelled the impact of financial integration, of which MiFID is the cornerstone, in terms of its impact on the then EU-15.
The main conclusions from the study were that financial integration would lead to a reduction in the cost of equity capital of an average of 50 basis points across the Member States, and a reduction in the cost of market debt for non-financial issuers of 40 basis points.
The study estimated that the combined effects of financial market integration to the EU economy would result in the following: an increase of EU-wide real GDP of 1.1% in the long run; an increase of 6% of the total business investment; an increase in private consumption of 0.8%; and an increase of 0.5% in total employment.
Figures compiled informally by the Committee of European Securities Regulators in the run-up to the implementation of MiFID suggest that only very limited numbers of firms were at that time making use of the passport for investment services under the then Investment Services Directive into or out of Greece.
We expect this to change in the future as Greek markets open up as a result of MiFID, and as Greek firms see more opportunities in other Member States.
The Federation of European Securities Exchanges keeps statistics on foreign equity trading, as well as on the percentage of shares owned by investors.
As of December 2005, 41% of the shares traded on the Athens exchange were held by foreign investors.
In November 2007, the foreign equity trading turnover on the Athens exchange was EUR 970 million.
(EL) Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his answer, and I would like to ask in addition whether the Commission has data on the volume of credit intermediation in the European Union, and specifically what percentage of the European GDP this credit intermediation represents.
Member of the Commission. - The Commission sent a letter of formal notice to the Irish authorities following a complaint on 29 June 2007.
This letter requested information on restrictive conditions set out in a number of Irish county development plans.
The Commission raised questions regarding the compatibility of certain requirements to obtain building permission with two principles of the Treaty, namely the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital.
Indirectly, such restrictions could also affect the free movement of workers, but this issue was not raised.
Following an agreed extension of one month to respond, the Irish authorities sent their response at the end of September.
My services have been examining its content and are planning to contact the Irish authorities in order to hold a meeting at a technical level to further clarify and discuss the position of the Irish authorities.
Following these discussions, the Commission will be in a position to assess whether or not there are grounds to pursue this infringement procedure.
The response from the Irish Government was lodged on 28 September 2007.
I understand that the response has not been made public.
This is a very important issue which affects 22 local authorities in Ireland.
I am just wondering if the response can be released at this stage now that it is before the Commission and it has had time to consider it?
Maybe the Commissioner might outline the timescale when a decision will be made by the Commission on this matter.
Member of the Commission. - It is not our practice to make responses available to the public, but then again those responses often end up in the public domain.
I can confirm that we received a response on 28 September 2007, as the Honourable Member has stated.
As I said in my reply, we intend to have a meeting with the Irish authorities about this matter.
We will see how we proceed from there.
I should point out, also, that Ireland is not the only Member State where there are difficulties like this.
My services are hoping to meet the Irish authorities in the very near future, and we will then have to consider what they say and take further steps, if these are required.
I should just like to ask the Commissioner - with regard to the rule of subsidiarity, and in particular the issue of planning permission - is this an area that the Commission should be involved in, when the operation of planning and the right to build a property is separate from the right to own property and exploit that property?
Member of the Commission. - On 17 November, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion requesting that Ireland abolish the exemption in place for the Irish Voluntary Health Insurance (VHI) from certain EU rules.
These rules, notably the first non-life insurance directive of 1973, as subsequently amended, aim at harmonising certain requirements for the commencement and conduct of direct non-life insurance business, and therefore also pertain to private health insurance.
The first non-life insurance directive exempted the VHI, among other institutions, from its rules.
However, this exemption is applicable only as long as the capacity of the exempted institution is not in any way amended by a change of its statutes or by any change in the relevant national law.
Accordingly, upon extension or change of capacity, the institution becomes subject to the full set of rules of Community law which otherwise apply to non-life insurance.
These rules, for example, require insurance undertakings to seek official authorisation before taking up their business; to adopt a certain legal form; and to establish adequate protective provisions which have to be sufficiently matched by the undertaking's assets in order to retain an adequate solvency margin.
One of the main objectives of these provisions is to protect the rights of those who have subscribed to an insurance policy, thereby making sure that the exercise of freedom to provide services is not to the detriment of consumer protection.
In addition, these rules guarantee a level playing field between insurers.
Given its initial exemption from the first directive, and as long as its capacity remained unchanged, the VHI did not have to comply with these rules.
The Commission, however, takes the view that the VHI's capacity has indeed changed.
Several amendments to the relevant Irish law in 1996, 1998 and 2001 extended the VHI's scope of business far beyond what it was when the VHI's exemption was first granted.
Therefore, VHI's initial exemption from the EU's rules for insurers is no longer applicable.
The Commission expressed this view in the reasoned opinion that was sent to Ireland on 14 November.
It has asked Ireland to take, within two months, the necessary steps to subject the VHI to those supervisory and prudential rules of Community law for which it formerly enjoyed the exemption.
The Commission considers that this reasoned opinion is a decisive step towards putting all competitors in the Irish private health insurance market on an equal footing under European insurance legislation.
This serves the interests of policyholders as well as of fair competition.
The Commission will closely monitor the steps taken by the Irish Government and will, failing appropriate action, pursue legal proceedings before the European Court of Justice.
Madam President, may I thank the Commissioner for taking the question.
Could I ask him if he has any indication of the timescale involved in obtaining a reply from the Irish Government in relation to the VHI in particular?
Could I ask him whether this will have any implications for equalisation?
The VHI continues to dominate 75% of the market in Ireland, but they claim that they need risk equalisation to protect them from being left holding all the older, and therefore higher-liability, clients.
Will the issue raised by the Commissioner have any implications for equalisation?
Member of the Commission. - The Commission uses all the instruments available to ensure the effective enforcement of consumer rights across Europe.
A new consumer-enforcement network was established at the end of 2006 in the regulation on consumer protection cooperation.
It provides a framework for joint market surveillance and enforcement exercises, such as the sweep on air ticket sales sites, carried out in September 2007.
That was the first ever exercise of its type.
The Commission coordinated this exercise, and provided the results of the first phase of the investigation in November 2007.
At this stage, the disclosure of the names of the sites on which certain irregularities were detected, as suggested by the honourable Member, would be premature and would not respect the legal framework in certain Member States.
I quite understand your impatience, because we would all like to get things done, and in the right way.
However, the right of reply, which means the right to defend oneself, is recognised across the EU Member States.
It is the competence of the national authorities and courts to apply that right, and we are awaiting the outcome of court decisions in some countries.
The Commission will, therefore, present the outcome of the investigations and enforcement actions presently ongoing in the Member States once those proceedings have been completed.
I have held talks with the authorities on the basis of the consumer enforcement network, and they are committed to going further and to providing this data, but court procedures - in at least two countries - prevent us from having a full picture and from announcing it publicly.
I think last July we all applauded the Degutis report when at last we said we were going to have transparency in relation to charging, that all taxes and fees levied would be upfront in all advertisements.
And then we read, in The European Voice on 31 October: 'Air ticket sites faced EU shame: Commission threatens to reveal the names of the hundreds of websites which allegedly mislead consumers'.
I am at a loss to know why these big commercial operations are not named, why they are not shamed.
They continue to flout the rules and regulations and the undertaking.
They continue to mislead the consumer.
Last week, for example, Ryanair - give them credit for what they have done - published this in all Irish newspapers: 'Buy one flight, get a second absolutely free.
Pay no fees, taxes, levies or charges'.
So I booked my flight, and it cost me EUR 153.
And then the one that was supposed to be free is as follows: credit card fee: EUR 12; taxes, fees and charges: EUR 39.96; insurance: EUR 14.
Total price: free flight EUR 67.
What more evidence do you want?
Member of the Commission. - Cases like this one were the main reason to step up and to have this enforcement action.
But I must reiterate: in many Member States it is only possible to publish the names of the airlines after the investigations and enforcement actions are finished.
Since cases differ, the time needed to deal with them can take longer in some cases than in others.
Currently the Commission is discussing with Member States how much time is needed to finish these actions and the Commission will publish - I already have this commitment - these names as soon as it is legally possible, otherwise the Commission could be sued.
If Member States can close the cases as originally foreseen, the names can be published in the coming months.
Initially I thought that we would be able to do it in February, but after more detailed discussions, comparing the legal system and how much time it takes from the legal point of view, I believe there may be a delay of one and a half months.
But I think that you are absolutely right and, if you allow me, I will use your case as one more reason for the need to step up.
We have, since the beginning of this year, unfair commercial practices and while trying not to go too much into cases, I think this is a good example of a breach of the unfair commercial practices legislation as well.
(EL) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I was one of the first, if not the first, to ask this question before the November issue came up, and before the announcement.
In your answer, you told me that within reasonable time, about two months, we would have the names or the results of your research.
Afterwards, in an interview you gave, I saw that you said four months.
Also, when the name of Ryan was announced, or rather appeared in the newspapers - as our colleague Mr Higgins has quite rightly said - as one of the companies, and according to your research there are 433 airlines and tourist agencies which have this kind of low-priced ticket, finally Ryan said it was not the only one.
Some other large, well-known companies used their name, which I would not like to use in Parliament, and you closed your eyes to this issue.
I therefore think it is advisable that you should give the names soon, so that public opinion, and competition among companies, large or small, can be allowed to cool down.
Member of the Commission. - I will not deny that I have drawn inspiration from Parliament and its Members many times, so I am glad that in this case it is regarding the specific investigation on air tickets.
We actually picked air tickets for our first sweep quite deliberately.
I do not want to sound defensive.
I am doing what I am required by law.
I have taken the advice of the Commission's Legal Services and can go further before the Court procedures are over in certain Member States.
If the procedure in one Member State takes four months, I cannot do anything.
Acting before that procedure is concluded would be in breach of national legislation, and would endanger the reputation of the Commission.
That is why I am waiting until these procedures are completed before the names are published.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
I should like to thank Commissioner Kuneva for waiting.
That concludes Question Time.
Madam President, I apologise to you, and to the interpreters for delaying them further.
I just wish to place on the record my objection to the way that Question Time again has been messed around.
Those of us who use it as a political tool to try and get answers from the institutions are left without any words as regards how badly we are treated as Members of this House.
I will be raising this matter at the Conference of Presidents, but I hope that the Bureau will take it on board as well and try and make sure the working of the Chamber on a day-to-day basis does not encroach every single time on our Question Time.
Thank you, Mr Crowley.
I think you will be aware that today has been a difficult day for one reason and another.
We have had almost an hour and a half, and we have done our best to accommodate everybody's wishes.
As you will know, we are also hoping to improve matters with the reform working group, but thank you for your comments, and thank you to our interpreters.
(The sitting was suspended at 19.45 and resumed at 21.00)
Adult learning: It is never too late to learn (debate)
The next item is the report by Doris Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on adult learning: it is never too late to learn.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the title of the Commission's communication and action plan on adult learning, 'It is never too late to learn', and its German title, Man lernt nie aus ('You live and learn'), are both universally familiar sayings, but when you read between the lines in the present context, they actually imply an acknowledgement of past omissions in the field of European education policy.
None the less, we are pleased that the Commission, with this communication and this action plan, is entering an age marked by growing awareness of the need for lifelong learning, an age in which new demographic challenges must be faced.
Economic and social changes in the EU require significant adjustments to vocational skills and qualifications.
The challenges of the labour market must be met, by which I mean that the employability of individuals must be one of the foremost aims of adult education.
Education, however, and especially adult education, is also a factor in people's personal development, in their self-esteem, their civic involvement, their social inclusion and their engagement in intercultural dialogue.
Several sets of research findings have shown that learning has important non-economic benefits such as promoting good health, fostering participation in the life of society among all age groups and, of course, reducing crime rates.
It is therefore my political priority to increase people's motivation to engage in lifelong learning.
Media campaigns, information and advice centres and adapted forms of communication for disadvantaged groups are very important.
Special phone numbers and websites have also proved highly successful in some countries.
In this context, great importance also attaches to efforts to reconcile work, family life and lifelong learning.
Let me list in shorthand just a few means to this end: adaptation of working hours, flexitime, distance-learning programmes and informal learning paths.
The use of new technology must be constantly perfected, especially through the creation of wider Internet access to encourage recourse to such new learning methods.
There must be continued growth in the number of public and private day nurseries and company crÃšches.
Another important factor, in my view, is solidarity between generations and between cultures.
Adults and senior citizens who pass on knowledge and technical know-how to younger people, particularly expertise in a trade or in business practice, can play an effective supporting role.
They can provide practical guidance, and there must also be scope to form networks for this purpose.
In this way, I believe, each can learn from the other.
There is also, however, a family-based approach to learning.
Parents are motivated to start learning again in order to help their children at school.
In addition, adult education also depends on voluntary helpers, who enrich it by lending their experience and providing skilled instruction.
The special needs of migrants must also be taken into account, which brings me to the subject of language courses.
We need these language courses to enable migrants to learn the language of their host country, but we also need language courses to enable adults to learn the language of a neighbouring country or another foreign language, which is something we have always advocated.
Access to institutions of higher education must also be made easier for adults with practical vocational experience.
One very important message is that the quality of existing adult-education centres and the education they offer should be improved.
There is a need for well-qualified trainers in adult education as well as specific programmes of courses in adult education.
I can only speak for Germany, where there is a university course that leads to a degree in adult education.
I believe we must all remind course providers that they can obtain funding for their proposed courses from the European Social Fund, for example, or from any of the structural funds.
I naturally expect the Commission to offer the present Lifelong Learning programme in both the Grundvig and Leonardo programmes in order to ensure that we too can do our bit to launch the action plan.
I believe there many ways of performing good work in this field, and we should waste no time in doing so.
Let me stress one final point: performance in adult education must be made measurable, otherwise no one will know who is doing what.
There are very many players in this field, and they must all be taken into account, be they private, university-based or public educational establishments.
There is, in short, a great deal to be done, and I suggest we get down to work.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would very much like to show my appreciation of this report and to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Pack for her commitment, efforts and contributions and also Mr Andersson from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and Ms FlasarovÃ¡ from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
I am very pleased that our two communications from 2006 and 2007 received a very concrete and strong response from the European Parliament.
The first was on adult learning and the second, on the European action plan on this matter, adopted in September.
As you have recognised, the importance of adult learning is clearly increasing.
First of all, global competition is a reality.
We need to invest in education at all stages of life and at all levels, and the skills and competences of adults need to be continuously upgraded.
Secondly, demographic changes mean that people need to work at least some years longer and they need to maintain the relevance of their skills to do this.
Thirdly, adult learning helps to combat social exclusion.
Too many adults with low education levels risk being excluded from the labour market.
So adult learning has a vital role in lifelong learning strategies.
I welcome your support for many reasons, particularly for improving the quality and accessibility of adult learning, including through better childcare and e-learning, and in particular for groups with special needs, as well as for speeding up the assessment of skills and valuing informal learning, for investing more in general and also for adapting to the needs of women, migrants and the ageing population.
Last but not least, for developing reliable and comparable data to measure adult learning, as Ms Pack mentioned.
We will follow up all these elements in implementing the European action plan.
As you suggest, these are all kinds of good practices in the Member States which we will use in our cooperation.
We will support these best practices via peer learning activities and studies, through the Lifelong Learning Programme and the European Social Fund mentioned earlier, in order to share knowledge and experience.
In implementing the action plan with the cooperation of Member States, we will analyse the effect of national reforms on adult learning, especially in the light of the recently adopted European Qualifications Framework.
We will also develop standards for adult learning professionals and quality assurance mechanisms based on existing good practice.
We want to encourage Member States to set targets for increasing the skill levels of adults and to speed up the process of assessing and recognising non-formal and informal learning for groups at risk.
Last but not least, we will propose a set of core data to improve monitoring of the sector.
I look forward to the debate but in particular to continuous support in this direction.
rapporteur for an opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, I thank the rapporteur for an excellent report.
It follows from the entire strategy that we have in the EU and the entire Lisbon process that training should be the key, not just to ensuring growth and employment in the future, but also to combating social exclusion.
For the EU countries to hold their own in global competition, training and, not just more jobs, but better jobs, as well as people with a high level of skills, play a vital role.
We therefore welcome this report.
I have a few more comments to make.
It is important that we make use of all the resources available in order to facilitate training for different groups.
An example of these is childcare.
It must be possible for both men and women who are the parents of young children to take part in training.
Hence there must also be a strategy for childcare.
It is important that we look at special groups, for example the elderly.
There are very few elderly people in the workforce today.
This is to a large extent due to the fact that they do not have access to continuing training and adult education.
We must concentrate on that group.
Another group are people starting with a low level of education.
If we consider the training situation today, looking at continuing training and adult education, we notice that it is those who are already well educated who get the most training.
It is important that we have an equality aspect in training as well.
Since my speaking time is short, I will merely point out in conclusion that it is important to have good cooperation and to include the social partners in this process.
draftsman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the report by my colleague Mrs Pack and I congratulate her on the way in which she has dealt with the topic.
I would like to stress the need to pay attention to the education of women, the socially vulnerable, immigrants and minorities.
I would like to mention one other aspect of education.
In a world where most things are subordinate to finances, trade, advertising, careers and competition in the labour market, education often appears to be merely a stepping stone to a better social position.
If education achieves this practical aim and makes a person better prepared for work, and if that person can keep up with the competitive environment, that is certainly a good thing.
However, the most important aspect of education is that it makes a person richer on the inside and better equipped to distinguish good from bad.
Society is experiencing a crisis of values.
Instead of traditions and authorities, we have the individual freedom for which we have been striving throughout our modern history.
However, it is also the freedom to know or not to know, the freedom to see and the freedom to keep one's eyes closed, the freedom to form one's own opinions and the freedom to accept the ideas of others.
Education on its own will not solve our problems, but it can encourage us to think about them .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, the European demographical situation makes it necessary to reorganise pension systems and raise the age limit, and we are hearing more and more about controlled immigration instead of realising the hidden potential of our own over-50s.
Well organised adult education enables experts who have worked for several decades to refresh their knowledge and adapt to the changed circumstances.
It also enables adults who are excluded from the labour market but not of retirement age to be engaged and undertake work, through retraining, language, IT and other professional training.
This function of adult education is particularly topical in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, where the employment indices fall well behind the average for the EU-15.
In addition to its bearing on the labour market, adult education also has a third, social and personal dimension, since Internet language courses, dancing classes or cookery courses organised for elderly people contribute to improving their quality of life and to their positive frame of mind.
There are two things that I consider to be particularly important for effective adult education: on the one hand, improvements to information and access, the presentation of successful projects and the sharing of experiences with those concerned.
Let us not forget that a tiny proportion of elderly people in the new Member States use the Internet, and we must use conservative, traditional methods that they can access.
A prominent role in this falls to local governments, who have detailed knowledge of the local conditions and needs.
On the other hand, assessing needs is an important task, that is to say, Member States should reach agreement with economic players, businesses and employers when designing their adult education programmes.
The economic needs of the country in question must be taken into account so that the amount spent on adult education is not money needlessly squandered, but bears demonstrable value to the individual, to society and to the economy.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Pack on her important and timely report.
Thank you for your attention.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, on an excellent piece of work and on her cooperative attitude towards our suggestions.
I wish to highlight the opportune timing of this report at a time when the scale of socioeconomic changes, the rapid transition towards an information society and the demographic trend associated with an ageing European population all require significant effort in the education and training of adults and lifelong learning.
They are key aspects of attaining what we refer to as the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
In the report itself I would like to draw attention to the need to foster motivation in people to continue learning.
I believe, however, that to be effective, this should be accompanied by active policies which above all help to make learning compatible with family and working life, particularly for women.
These measures should take the form of incentives for going on training programmes and more particularly for broadening public childcare and education services, as well as care for the elderly, in short for dependants, so as to release families from burdens which in many cases still fall on women.
Moreover, I am convinced that it is appropriate to foster a learning culture which acknowledges merit and improves the employment prospects of poorly qualified people, helps increase social inclusion and personal development.
This approach is particularly important for 'at risk' groups.
I also view it as essential to modernise higher education systems and make them more flexible so that they become more responsive to people's growing and diverse social needs while improving the quality of education and broadening supply.
Finally, I wish to refer to the importance of broadening the supply of training in digital technologies to reduce the digital gap which also exists within our societies between sexes, between generations, and between the populations of different geographical areas.
In short, I welcome the Commission proposal and I hope it takes account of Parliament's proposals so that we can jointly help raise the awareness of the Member States to the need to act as soon as possible in this area, not only so as to remove barriers to adult involvement in learning, but to encourage it, recognise its economic, social and cultural value in all countries and exchange national data which enable the progress being made to be compared and measured.
Lifelong learning is becoming more and more important in modern society.
It is gratifying that the significance and necessity of adult learning is being analysed more and more actively and is better acknowledged in all EU Member States and the main institutions.
Adult education experts in Lithuania are also actively putting forward proposals for this communication.
The government programme plans to extend the provision of informal adult education services in municipal educational institutions, to try to ensure that educational institution buildings and the adult education environment are modern and attractive and that centres are provided with modern teaching aids.
I would also like to emphasise that adult educators and their organisations need a more active voice and that politicians must listen to this and support it in order to achieve advances in the area of qualitative changes in adult education.
Not only must we discuss the problems that arise, but we must also solve them appropriately, because this will determine how adult education is developed over the coming years.
The problem in Lithuania is pressingly relevant in this context - the integration of vulnerable groups in society, and the disabled in particular.
Moreover, the possibilities for adults raising pre-teen children to learn after working hours have not yet been solved.
Often parents cannot learn simply because they have nowhere to leave their children.
There is also a lack of flexibility in the adult education system.
Sometimes people who have not finished secondary school and are still under the age of 18 want to continue their studies under adult education programmes, but they cannot do so because such education is allowed only from the age of 18.
Certainly, insufficient funding is also an important problem.
I would agree with the President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus, who said that more and more people in Lithuania understand that learning is not just a young person's duty.
Today, lifelong learning is becoming a challenge for our country and its citizens.
We need to grasp this opportunity because we will be able to show the rapidly changing world that Lithuania is creative, open to innovation and not afraid of setting ambitious goals when opening up possibilities and ways of learning.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would also like to begin by thanking Mrs Pack and congratulating her on her report - because of her willing attitude most of the amendments tabled by our Group were also incorporated into it.
I would like to say that adult education has always been one of the best ways both to effect social and economic development and to contribute to better wealth distribution.
Now, in this changing information society where we must continually update our knowledge, the initial basic education of adults, and subsequent ongoing training, is a need of the first order.
Adults must adapt to the continuous change imposed by globalisation and take decisions in order to be able to survive while maintaining an adequate quality of life.
However, most educational systems do not respond sufficiently to people's requirements in such a way as to be able to keep sufficiently abreast of the changing society in which they live.
In contrast to previous eras, the role of education is not to obtain lessons to be applied in a known world, but in a world of continuous change which may produce unforeseeable circumstances.
The point is therefore to provide a system of education which can respond to the needs of adults in a society undergoing permanent change.
In short, education must prepare people for looking ahead and for innovation and must no longer concern itself with just fitting in.
We are in transit between an industrial and post-industrial society, and the type of society towards which we are moving will form the framework for adult education; on that point I have congratulated the rapporteur and would also like to congratulate the Commission because I believe that the current report is in that vein.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, lifelong learning is something the UK has always excelled at.
Our Open University was the first establishment of its kind in the world, founded in the 1960s and based on a concept dating from the 1920s.
Hundreds of thousands of so-called 'mature students' have graduated from the Open University, many of them graduates returning to their studies.
Therefore I think the UK is fine when it comes to lifelong learning and, with respect, I do not think we need to accept any more interference from this place in education, which is still a national competence.
However, just making it available is never enough for this place.
The next step, of course, is compulsion.
After all, what is the point of providing something that is not used?
But, then, you do have a history in this area of billions of euros and other currencies wasted by EU institutions, and nation states blithely following orders is par for the course.
But bringing this closer to home - specifically to bureaucrats and politicians in this House - it is now obvious to me that no matter how long you live, you simply do not learn!
You do not even want to listen.
You just carry on with the projects and to hell with anyone who might not agree or have a different point of view.
I am reminded of the old saying, attributed to Sun Tzu but famously used by Kennedy: those who make peaceful protest impossible make violent protest inevitable.
If you do not learn from your mistakes, you are doomed to repeat them.
(SK) First of all, please allow me to thank Mrs Doris Pack for all the energy she put into the preparation of this report.
I would also like to thank the representatives of the European Commission for the initiatives that lead to the improvement of the existing situation.
As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education on the European Qualifications Framework, I consider the issue of lifelong education to be very important, primarily from two points of view.
The first is the improvement in qualifications, an increase in the ability to find work and overcome discrepancies in the labour market, as well as an improvement in geographical and professional mobility.
The second is the quest for lifelong personal development and integration into society.
Too few adults participate in education and vocational training.
I believe that focusing on improving the citizens' motivation with regard to life-long learning is a positive step.
It is fundamental in this process to take into consideration the improvement of conditions for the reconciliation of working and family life, solidarity between generations and cultures, language learning and an improvement in the quality of education and its prospects.
What is to be commended is the recognition and appreciation of non-formal and informal education.
The important objectives are to improve the qualifications of workers with few qualifications, who form one third of the European workforce - up to 72 million people - and, finally, the education of immigrants.
If we wish to achieve by 2010 the benchmark goal of 12.5% participation in adult learning, which means the participation of a further 4 million people - one of the requirements will be to establish a connection between the education systems at European level and the National Qualification Frameworks.
I should like to reassure Mrs Pack that the Chair's acknowledgements are a proper and institutional token of respect for rapporteurs and the opinions that they express, even when we are completely at odds with their content.
Mr President, 'a good priest learns until death' says the Hungarian proverb.
In these days not only the priest, but all adults should learn during their adult years.
I welcome Ms Pack's report and the Commission's Adult Learning Action Plan as well.
Of course, it is very sad that only 9.6% of our adult citizens participate in lifelong learning.
It is not easy to start learning when you have grown up.
The harmonisation of family life, working life and learning is a hard task, but in the longer term both the family and the professional career may benefit from adult learning.
In Europe we have millions of unemployed people and at the same time millions of empty jobs requiring skilled employees.
The low level of qualifications implies a high risk of unemployment, but continuous training and learning may help both the person and the economy.
I agree with Ms Pack that not only should lifelong learning be promoted, but economic tools are also needed to encourage employers to hire older workers.
There is only one solution for the challenge of our ageing society: to respect older workers and provide proper jobs for the older generation as well.
Of course, for these we need lifelong learning and also lifelong vocational training.
(RO) We are aware that Member States recognise the extremely important role of lifelong learning, as it contributes to the citizens' welfare, self-confidence, social integration, and intercultural dialogue.
Nevertheless, the access of adults to lifelong learning programmes remains limited, despite the European Union's aim of achieving 12.5% participation by 2010.
This is why the implementation and promotion by Member States of effective European programs for the education and training of adults, especially the elderly, the disabled and migrants, could lead to their more successful integration in society and increased mobility on the labour market.
As a member of the Committee on Education and Culture, I believe that the development of volunteer programmes concerning solidarity between generations and the involvement of government, private enterprise and individuals is a key point for taking up the new challenges posed by demographic change, poverty and social exclusion.
By virtue of the right to literacy and education, and of the Member States' obligation to provide quality training for their adult citizens, I believe, Mr President, that we too are responsible for the development of sustainable tools for funding and supporting lifelong education and training.
Mr President, if the Commissioner were to ask people where they learn, they would tell him where they went to school.
But most of the learning we do is outside this experience of formal education.
The challenge in lifelong learning is not only to offer opportunities to adults to gain new and more qualifications, but also to find a way to recognise and capitalise on the very valuable learning many adults have gained informally through life and work experience.
A constituent of mine has pioneered the successful handling of some of the most difficult fish varieties and also the environmentally friendly fish-farming techniques that they require.
He has no college degree, so when the Commission gives grants in this field, they do not go to him.
Instead, the grants go to academics with no experience, who then come to him to find out how he does what he does.
He is tired of this rip-off, and the fishing industry will be the poorer for this.
I urge the Commissioner to look at this as there has to be a better way.
(CS) Mr Chairman, Commissioner, the greatest obstacles that prevent adults from taking part in education are lack of time due to work or family commitments.
Another negative factor is the lack of information and lack of motivation: according to general opinion, education later in life is not valued enough and not rewarded enough.
An important aspect of adult education is its effectiveness and fairness.
The educational systems of the EU Member States focus primarily on the education and professional training of young people.
Only a little progress has been made in changing this situation and that progress has so far been of little significance.
The general objective must therefore be to make maximum use of the various providers of education in the adult educational system.
It is our aim to enable access to good and timely information on the possibilities of adult education and to explain the entry requirements and costs, not to mention the advantages of completing such education.
I agree with the view of the rapporteur that the Member States must introduce quality consultation systems and financial incentives targeted at individuals.
They must also support the development of local partnerships.
In addition, it is important to introduce a system for the recognition and verification of the results of such education in the context of national qualifications, taking into account the European Qualifications Framework.
The advantages of investing in adult education are also confirmed by the research done by the OECD.
The public and private benefits include higher employability, increased work productivity, lower unemployment benefit expenditure, lower social benefits expenditure and lower early retirement.
This report invites us to reconsider the stated policy priorities in the field of adult education and take concrete steps.
I congratulate our rapporteur.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen.
Enlargement in 2004 increased economic growth in the European Union by an amount which engendered unjustified confidence.
However, today the cooling of the economy is causing social tensions even in the new Member States.
I am referring to the bill on employment contracts which is currently causing controversy in my home country, Estonia.
In anticipation of redundancies, Estonian businesspeople are trying to make people who are to be made redundant bear the brunt of the social effects of the disappearance of employment.
Perhaps those who are more vulnerable, namely employees who have lost their jobs, are once again at a loss as to what they are being punished for.
In the absence of effective steps, both secure flexibility and lifelong learning are reduced merely to empty words in whose shadow the more vulnerable in society are left without the support they need.
Raising the retirement age in line with the rise in average life expectancy means that a 45-year-old worker has yet to reach the mid-point of his career.
It means a new beginning in middle age.
Yet discrimination on grounds of age and sex is an undeniable reality in work places the world over, including the European Union.
The trend towards having children later in life means that women find it twice as difficult to return to the labour market.
The Lifelong Learning Programme is an opportunity at least to a certain degree to compensate for the injustice which prevails today.
Similarly, employers should be encouraged to invest in people with experience of life.
Employers should be persuaded that knowledge and skills learnt in other areas of life, yes, even in home economics, are extremely valuable.
I wish to stress once again that the lifelong learning system is merely a supplement to the social pledges, not a replacement for them.
Drivers, no matter how experienced, should always fasten their seatbelts.
I thank and congratulate the rapporteur on a fine piece of work.
Thank you, Mrs Pack!
(SL) Man is a most adaptable creature, which is why many adults have already accepted the fact that one should keep acquiring knowledge even in mature years and in old age.
In future, those people who have never stopped learning will certainly have an advantage in adapting to the rapid changes with which we are faced on a daily basis.
It is also important for the well-being of the elderly for them to continue participating in the shaping of society by using their knowledge and experience.
This gives them the satisfaction of knowing that they are useful and needed in society.
Because the population is getting older, new occupations best suited to the elderly will have to be created.
A friend of mine, who has ten children and no grandmother to help bring them up, asked me: "Do you know where I could buy a granny for my children?â
I also often recall the story of a doctor who asked a retired teacher to teach a badly burned boy in hospital.
The boy was not expected to survive.
Due to the teacher's persistence, patience and experience, the boy started responding to her questions.
He started believing in life.
Why would doctors send a teacher to work so hard with a boy whom they did not believe would survive?
An elderly person's knowledge saved a young life.
The young have many abilities and advantages in learning which sometimes they do not fully exploit, but older people must find willpower and receive encouragement because it is never too late to acquire knowledge and they can compensate for things for which, perhaps, there was no time or money in their youth.
Acquiring knowledge means enjoying life more fully.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this century it is surely not difficult to convince anyone that general and vocational education can no longer be confined to school and the immediate post-school years but has to be updated and extended throughout people's working lives.
Changing demographic trends, for example, provide sufficient evidence of this requirement.
In this context, Mrs Pack's excellent report puts forward a host of good ideas and very successfully conveys the need to create a culture of learning, particularly among adults.
To this end she lists a number of measures that should be taken at various levels.
Adult education is, of course, primarily a task for the Member States.
For this reason the EU cannot prescribe action; instead, we must make suggestions and request, encourage and invite the Member States to offer a range of measures that will bring more people into adult education.
Like the rapporteur, I firmly believe - and I say this as vice-chairman of the Committee on Regional Development - that many Member States are not fully aware of the significance and use of the European Social Fund and other structural funds as instruments in the pursuit of lifelong learning.
They should monitor the structural funds with this objective in mind as well as ensuring that more resources are made available for those whose need of lifelong learning is greatest.
In short, the report calls clearly on the Member States to make active use of instruments such as the European Social Fund and on the Commission to reinforce specific programmes in the field of adult education.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to speak this evening in a House which, I have to say, is well attended.
The report on adult learning 'it is never too late to learn' has been presented to us today by Mrs Pack with her customary intelligence and expertise.
I am pleased to see the representatives of the Commission, including Mr Figel', who is among the most active and enthusiastic in his work, because there is a real need for commitment, since this issue - that is, the education and learning of younger, working or older people - is one that could really bring citizens closer to Europe.
I should like to say something about a group of adults who could benefit from this learning: because there are adults of the first, second and third ages.
By third-age adults I mean those who have stopped working, enteredretirement and can finally settle down to study the subject which they have always wanted to study, but have never had the time to study in any depth.
I, for instance, would study astronomy, others might study physics or geography.
In my view it is right and important for Europe to smooth the transition from work and working age to non-working age, during which people are just as entitled to learn and to be educated.
For that reason I am very content with this report and this initiative by the European Parliament to promote learning among older people as well.
- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when fighting unemployment, the objective at the heart of the strategy is to make it easier for employees to adapt to the labour market, and this can be achieved through lifelong learning.
The objective was that by 2010 at least 12% of people would take part in adult education.
We are now aware that the target will not be reached.
However, I would like to note that there are some countries, such as Holland and Austria, that have already achieved the Lisbon objective thanks to significant incentives, such as the division of time and financial expenditure between employees, companies and the State.
The Danish experience is also valuable.
Here the rotation of workers facilitates the development of qualifications.
When an employee is undergoing training, his place is taken by a person who at that time is unemployed.
These countries, and others, prove that it can be done, that flexibility of the labour market is the way towards innovations that create new jobs.
The result is the lowest level of long-term unemployment: long-term unemployment in Denmark is only 0.8%.
I would like to believe that the situation will fundamentally change even in the new countries on the back of examples and huge incentives provided by the European Social Fund.
I welcome the Commission communication and the report by Mrs Pack.
(RO) Indeed, it's never too late to learn.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her handling of this topic, which is an essential one at European level and beyond.
Unfortunately, many citizens still believe that education is something one acquires in the first part of one's life.
We must encourage access to European funds available for adult education, particularly in Member States that have recently joined the Union.
The degree of absorption of funds is rather low in these states, and the number of people involved in professional retraining and lifelong learning is very low.
I believe it is essential to change the mentality of young people still at the initial stage of their education, so as to prepare them for a Europe on the move.
By developing new, European-level programs, we should instil in them the idea that training does not end once you've obtained your first qualification.
It's important to be aware that anyone, anytime, can acquire new skills and competences, irrespective of their age, ethnicity, gender, or location.
Taking all these into account, a fundamental precept emerges: we must be able to learn.
(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, the very rapid changes in the structure of the labour market require highly-qualified workers.
People with few qualifications remain on the fringe of social and economic progress.
Creativity and innovation are the key factors of the modern age.
The more inventive a man is, the more creative a source for the economy he is.
Prosperous economies are those that invest in people (and that means in education), in the basic technological and language skills of the workforce.
It is important to awaken, through lifelong learning, the abilities that are lying dormant in people of all ages and waiting to be used.
I believe that this wonderful report by the rapporteur, Doris Pack, 'Adult learning: It is never late to learn', will not remain mere words; I believe that we will succeeding in converting it into action.
Commissioner FigeÄŸ, thank you for your personal involvement in the field of lifelong learning.
(RO) I join my colleagues in congratulating Mrs Doris Pack on her work as rapporteur.
The topic is very important for today's Europe and especially for tomorrow's Europe.
The development of a new society as well as social cohesion are intimately linked to education, and by education we should not think only of formal education, but we should also encourage non-formal and informal education highly focused on the individual.
I would like to draw attention to the importance of migrant education.
I believe we have seen in practice that education for migrants is necessary for their social integration, for tolerance, stability, performance, and for overall European development.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Pack, and also the Commissioner, who is carrying out his duties in an excellent manner, also with regards to his work for the European Institute of Technology.
Today, however, we are discussing something else.
I would like to draw attention to one particular issue.
At the beginning of the 20th century Europe was fighting illiteracy; by the second half of the 20th century all Europeans could read and write.
Today's illiteracy is lack of computer skills and lack of Internet access.
I would like to propose that there be an even greater emphasis on this issue.
The digital divide also affects the generation gap.
The issue is that we should know in how many years, five years or ten years, every European will know how to use a computer, whatever their age, and will have Internet access.
Internet cafes could be used for this in very remote parts of Europe, where several computers are put into a single room, and all the inhabitants could use this location.
This is the challenge of the 21st century.
Member of the Commission. - (SK) I think that many of the contributions made are indeed an incentive to get involved in the issue of adult education.
Following this philosophy, and as has already been pointed out, it is never too late to learn.
The second document says that there is always a good reason or a good time to learn.
I would like to say that I see the report of Doris Pack, and the numerous initiatives that have been mentioned here, as a complement or an addition to what the Commission itself suggested.
This philosophy is therefore very valuable and welcome.
I would like to refer back to some of the specific measures, because they are helping and improving what is important to the approach as a whole: the importance of motivating adults to get involved in education; the need to ensure a better reconciliation of work, family life and life-long learning; the need for inter-generational and inter-cultural solidarity; the importance of language learning or teaching; respect for the specific requirements of vulnerable groups and the importance of high-quality teachers, which has been discussed recently: it is one of the key factors for educational success; and a better approach to higher education and creation of comparative statistical data or information.
The Commission will also reflect on your invitation to assess the career prospects linked to adult education and the subject of the financing of adult education.
These are very precise questions, which also fall within the remit of the Member States.
Finally, one the outcomes not only of this report but also of the Commission's documents will be the discussion of the Member States and conclusions of the Council of Ministers in February.
I believe that they will be sincere and support adult education that is accessible and of a high quality.
Please allow me one thought in conclusion: it is not only appreciation and gratitude, but also an appreciation of inspiration.
As a Commissioner, a politician as well as a father, I am convinced that education - and I mean accessible and high-quality education - is the most important factor for the political, economic, social and cultural development of individuals and society as a whole.
Moreover, education is the great equaliser, which means that it is an equaliser of those issues that are necessary for the equality of all.
Thank you very much and I look forward to our cooperation.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, first of all may I thank everyone involved for the flowers they have presented to me.
I would be happy to give a few blooms from this bouquet to Jan FigeÄŸ.
After having campaigned for adult education since 1993 and having seen the first fruits of these efforts, I am gratified that we have now achieved the great breakthrough in that the importance of adult education is recognised in every sphere of political activity.
I am particularly keen that every possible incentive be created to motivate adults to re-enter the education process.
Many have never had the opportunity, and many need to be motivated.
There is also a need to overcome these people's inhibitions and remove barriers.
This is why I also believe that the numerous adult-education centres, foundations and charitable organisations which, as we know, are already doing outstanding work in this field should be supported and that these providers' high standards - and I see no reason why they cannot become even higher - should be maintained.
As I said before, we must ensure that the quality of adult education is further improved.
I was delighted to hear that a working group had already been formed in your area of the Commission, Mr FigeÄŸ.
I am pleased that it can perhaps be linked with Grundvig too so that we can light the fuse, as it were, for the national governments.
Let us therefore make a start.
The many fine words really must now give way to deeds, and our task is simply to disprove the venerable saying 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'.
In the context of adult education that is as wrong as anything can be, which is why I hope that we can now try, by dint of our own efforts and with your help, to hoist the national governments into the saddle so that they can start trotting, for it will take a while before they are ready to gallop.
The debate is closed.
The vote on this item will take place on Wednesday, 16 January 2008 at 12 noon.
Witten statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committees for their successful and eminently social work.
At the same time, I was sorry to note that there was not a single reference in it to the question of developing information and communication skills.
We should just think of how much legislation we have created over the years that recognises new rights for European citizens and in how many cases we have prescribed that workers, consumers, pensioners or even tourists should have the relevant information and channels on the Internet.
All these things make sense if the beneficiaries can access the information.
The development of 'eskills' in lifelong learning and in general basic education will assume vital importance, as the foundation stone of a knowledge-based information society.
Another key task for Member States will be promoting equal opportunities in IT and electronic inclusion.
I am delighted that every Hungarian party agrees on this, even if they do not agree on many other things.
Modern information and communication technologies in themselves present an unprecedented opportunity to really promote cohesion and equal opportunities, but we can only use this opportunity if we guarantee the conditions to include everyone throughout their lives, so that, even for 'eskills', the title of the Committee's opinion will inevitably be true: 'It is never too late'.
Thank you for your attention.
Commission measures in 2008-2013 to make use of CAP remote-sensing applications (debate)
The next item is the report by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the measures to be undertaken by the Commission in 2008-13 making use of the remote-sensing applications developed within the framework of the common agricultural policy - C6-0273/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, before going into the content of the report, I first of all want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for the work that they have been doing on the evaluation of the Commission's proposal.
I would first like to make a few more general remarks to place the Commission's proposal in the right context.
The Commission's proposal concerns the agro-meteorological system utilised to prepare the crop yields forecast and to monitor the development of crops within the European Union.
This system was developed throughout the 1990s and has been fully operational since 1998.
I must say that I consider this to be a very useful tool.
This system provides the Commission's services with accurate information on the situation in the crop sector and also assists the Commission in taking timely decisions in the framework of the common agricultural policy, and therefore I find that it is quite natural that it is financed by the guidance funding.
Let me say the following on some of the proposals in the Committee on Agriculture report.
You have concerns about the use of the data that are collected.
I want to be very clear on this.
Control is not the aim of this system and it cannot and will not be used for any control of farmers within the European Union.
When we look at it from a technical point of view, the resolution of the remote-sensing images generated by the system is far too low to allow any controls, and this system - it must be clear as well - has nothing to do with our Integrated Administration and Control (IACS) System.
The rapporteur also states that there is no consensus that the proposed system actually works.
Work to develop the system started in the late 1980s and, as I said, since 1998, when it became operational, the system has actually provided yield forecasts on a regular basis to the Commission services.
We use this information on a daily basis, for example in our analysis of supply and price developments within the cereal sector.
Last year, in September 2007, the Commission provided an assessment of the system in a report to the European Parliament and to the Council that actually demonstrated the usefulness of the system.
The system is also implemented at national level in several Member States, and other countries are using or developing similar tools, so on this point I am not totally in line with you.
Finally, I welcome the principle of setting up an inventory of projects and initiatives in the field of space and remote-sensing.
However, this proposal is not the right place for this.
This would indeed fall under the European initiative of Global Monitoring for Environment and Security.
So we are not exactly on the same page, but I look forward to listening to the comments of the Honourable Members.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in the coordination committee of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development we pondered whether to produce a report on this matter or to let it pass without a report.
I had the task of examining this question in greater depth, and we subsequently decided that we would draft a report, which means that the two of us can discuss the matter again this evening - a useful thing in itself.
We did stumble over a few points, however, and this is reflected in the amendments we have formulated.
Firstly, the Commission's report said that the proposal was largely uncontested in the Council as elsewhere.
Our enquiries, however, have revealed that some countries, particularly in northern Europe, cannot do much with this satellite data because everything is still covered in snow there when the images are captured.
Secondly, the data is collected by private companies, which make it available to the Commission, and these private companies' main customers are in the gas and oil industries, an area of business that involves a degree of speculation.
What we must ensure - and this is why we want to invoke our parliamentary powers of scrutiny - is that this collected data is truly unconnected with any private speculative ambitions but that is actually used, as you have said, for the sole purpose of harvest and yield forecasting.
As you are also aware, however, this very data is used for speculation in commodity futures on the stock exchange, and such forecasts could be used for that purpose.
Before going any further, let me emphasise that the Commission and Parliament do share a common interest here, but Parliament has a scrutiny function, and so it makes sense for us to talk about that and to request reports from the Commission which show clearly what has happened to this data, how it is recorded and what purpose it serves.
It is essentially a matter of calling you to account in the coming years.
Then we were somewhat puzzled, of course, to learn that the financial basis for this data collection was suddenly to be changed.
Hitherto we have had a dedicated budget heading under which increases in appropriations and proposals for their retention have had to be discussed.
Now these activities are to be transferred to the Guarantee Fund, over which Parliament has less power of scrutiny.
Now we can assume that, when the Treaty enters into force at the start of 2009, the Guarantee Fund will no longer exist and these matters will therefore pass into full budgetary sovereignty of Parliament.
This approach was at least proposed, and when we received the report it was not yet clear when the Treaty would materialise.
So we said no, we did not want to make any changes now; it should stay as it was, namely in a budget line which could then be scrutinised by Parliament on the expenditure side.
All in all, Commissioner, I certainly believe we have more important problems to discuss and try to resolve concerning the health check than the subject of our deliberations here this evening.
Farmers, however, are very sensitive when there is any suspicion that they are being spied upon.
You have made it clear that this is not about surveillance or spying.
I shall gladly pass on that message, but you must understand us.
We as a Parliament must also ensure that you do.
It is because of our accountability to our voters that we have discussed this matter and are making this point.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, good evening, another evening discussing agriculture.
As the Commission notes in its report, in recent years remote sensing has shown how we can cope correctly with the management needs of the Common Agricultural Policy.
The traditional statistical and agricultural forecasting systems are beginning to become obsolete with the new technology which is invading all aspects of our lives.
It has also made possible improvements in the accuracy, objectivity, speed and frequency of observations as well as achieving savings in follow-up costs and monitoring of agricultural expenditure.
Remote sensing is, therefore, most welcome in the Common Agricultural Policy.
The draft report which will be put to the vote tomorrow generally endorses the European Commission, except on one point which I consider to be important as it concerns funding for the measure.
In the Agriculture Committee I supported the rapporteur's proposal to establish a specific budget for remote sensing of EUR 9.2 million outside the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund to safeguard future Community support for the development of remote sensing in all Member States.
I therefore welcome the outcome of the vote of the Committee on Agriculture, whose report also sets out the need to use the computer facilities of the Joint Research Centre site in Ispra to compile data from space, rather than the idea of creating a new computing infrastructure as proposed by the European Commission.
We should therefore streamline both the infrastructures and the financial budget, and we in the House should therefore support the document which will be put to the vote tomorrow.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is nothing technology will not do.
We have before us a proposal by the European Commission for extension of the programme that uses the most up-to-date technology to monitor our European agriculture.
After years of research, the scientists concerned can be justifiably proud of themselves.
Using satellites, it is, for instance, possible to monitor the use and condition of land, study the effects of climate change and even forecast harvests.
That means we can keep an eye on the situation and act in good time to predict and ward off problems, such as the failure of the grain harvest this year.
I was originally an engineer and I find this kind of practical application of principled technology to promote our well-being very exciting.
A 'tom-tom' system for agriculture. Who would ever have thought it?
Now we have to consider whether we as a Parliament are in favour of further research into and use of this application.
How could we say no?
I recommend that my colleagues in the Socialist Group vote for this directive, but I do want to make a couple of comments to the Commissioner who is with us at this late hour.
Firstly, I have my doubts about the inclusion of the budget and the programme in the Agricultural Guarantee Fund.
Up to now this project has had its own budget heading, which has allowed Parliament to monitor the situation and be kept regularly informed.
Despite the proven value of the programme, research is still continuing.
I would think it particularly unfortunate if the Commission no longer reported to us on the progress and results of the programme, or on the costs involved.
As a Member of Parliament and an interested party, I would urge that the separate budget heading is retained so that we are also kept informed in the future and can be involved in the consideration as well.
Secondly, I would like to see all the research results made freely available to other interested parties, such as universities and research institutes.
In the field of climate research particularly, the data that are coming to light thanks to MARS and LUCAS can be enormously useful.
Mr President, Commissioner, I shall conclude my maiden speech at this plenary with that appeal for transparency.
I am hoping for a positive response from Mrs Fischer Boel.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for the excellent way he has prepared this topic for debate.
He has worked hard and highlighted the flaws and problems associated with remote sensing.
A cautious approach, an emphasis on transparency and a precise specification of the scope of application are all appropriate here.
At its best remote sensing is a way to obtain information quickly on the condition of farms, crop yields and growing conditions.
This information can then be used, for example, in research, the planning of agricultural marketing, and the administration of the common agricultural policy.
There are still many flaws in the methods used, as the rapporteur points out.
Conditions vary from one Member State to another and the data from Member States is not fully comparable.
For example, in my country, Finland, snow-covered parcels of land are often so small that determining surface areas from satellite images is not always successful.
This being the case, the amendment which states that the information obtained should be used solely for estimating yields and not for control purposes is fitting.
Farmers today are burdened with red tape, paperwork and constant monitoring.
Unreasonably harsh sanctions are imposed if they unintentionally make mistakes owing to poor advice.
As remote sensing methods develop, it is to be hoped that they will help reduce the bureaucracy which is a continual torment to farmers.
First, however, we need to obtain more precise results of research to ensure that the methods are actually reliable and that they treat all farmers impartially.
As new methods are introduced, we also have to ensure that the privacy of farmers is protected and that the entire process is a transparent one.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, in order to have a common agricultural policy that works properly, what is needed, above all, is precise and reliable data.
Remote-sensing techniques make it possible, among other applications, to monitor cultivation and to forecast harvests.
This becomes even more significant in the light of advancing climate change.
Using remote sensing we can identify, at an earlier stage, conditions that are unfavourable for plant development and, as a result, forecast more quickly and accurately which areas are threatened by drought.
These techniques provide data for econometric models, which we frequently use when considering the consequences of introducing changes into the functioning of the common agricultural policy.
With initial data that is more precise we can reduce the probability of errors in the scenarios forecast.
For this reason, I believe that it is vital to continue the MARS project.
Financing sources for the project should, however, remain unchanged, i.e. within the framework of a separate budget line, and not from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.
Since the project is financed from EU funds, i.e. from the taxes of our citizens, I believe that an investigation should be carried out on the efficiency of the MARS project and on its potential applications that have not yet been put into use.
As usual I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report, and I fully agree with him that we must make sure that the system becomes more consolidated and, above all, more productive and more useful.
The final issue that I would like to consider is access to data.
Everyone should have the right to make use of this source of information, not just EU decision-makers but also Member States and research and academic institutions.
The data could even be useful at the level of the farm: for example, farmers could apply the information obtained from remote sensing in optimising agricultural treatments.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to support the view taken by the rapporteur and emphasise that remote-sensing techniques can be useful to the European Commission: first of all, in helping to manage agricultural markets, secondly, by making it possible to monitor cultivation and at the same time to forecast harvests, and thirdly and finally, this forecasting should have an impact on the prices of agricultural raw materials, which will be particularly important in the next few years, in a situation where the prices of foodstuffs are constantly rising.
Even if some of the objectives named above were to be fulfilled, this would be sufficient to acknowledge that remote sensing is a method that provides important information that is helpful in the proper management of the markets of individual agricultural products.
At the same time as giving this method a positive assessment, I would also like to state that I share the view of the rapporteur that work in this area should be financed from a special budget line, and not from the Agricultural Guarantee Fund.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was recently invited to a Rotary Club meeting, where a very interesting debate took place.
A Rotarian who is a fierce critic of the EU lamented that there was a great deal of fraud in Europe, that it went unchecked and that we had a particularly large number of problems in the realm of agriculture.
Interestingly, a few minutes later we had a farmer saying that he had just undergone an inspection which had been conducted with great rigour and precision and that he did not know of any area of activity that was subject to such thorough checking as agriculture.
I believe this shows very clearly what people need, namely information about what is actually happening.
This is why best practice and benchmarking are absolutely essential if we are to explain to the European public how much importance we attach to agricultural policy.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, this proposal for a regulation for the introduction of remote sensing via satellite is an interesting one.
Michel Debatisse, the French farmers' leader, put forward a remote-sensing proposal in this Chamber back in the 1990s, the area of application in that case being stock rearing.
The idea was to fix microchips in the ears of cattle and sheep, as part of a system for monitoring premium payments and preventing fraud in certain parts of southern France.
There had even been a plan for electronic capsules, which cattle would swallow and which would then become attached in a pocket in the intestine, enabling the stock to be identified and counted via satellite.
What we have before us today is something different, although it dates back seven years, to the MARS and LUCAS pilot projects.
The concept here entails supplying information about land use and the condition of the ground or crops, in order to forecast crop yields and, at the same time, to manage agricultural markets and produce econometric models.
There is an obvious danger with this aim of gathering information, improving statistics, producing forecasts and, indeed, creating a website: I am tempted to call it the danger of a remote-sensing elite, for the technology will be accessible only to large farmers or very rich regions, and not everyone will be enabled to anticipate prices - a particularly useful facility when the price of grain is rising. Obviously, the ability to anticipate prices several months in advance by predicting the harvest is a highly interesting prospect for the stock markets in Chicago or wherever.
Our rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, is right to be particularly interested in the matter of who will benefit from the system, especially as it comes at a price - I believe some ten million euros are involved, albeit spread over five or six years - and these sums will come not from an independent budget line but from an agricultural guarantee fund.
The system is certainly worth trying out, or pursuing, Commissioner.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is true that we sometimes have the opportunity to sit here late in the evening and discuss agricultural issues, but I must say that I enjoyed, no matter how late it is, having an opportunity to exchange views on this - for those of us present here tonight, anyway - very interesting topic.
Firstly, it is clear that, in situations where the areas are covered with snow, it is not possible - and this applies to our Finnish friends - to collect the data on the crops, but it is possible to collect the meteorological data, which will be available no matter what the weather conditions are.
As this is also closely linked to the development that we are seeing in the discussions on climate change, I think that this information is also valid and important.
There have been some concerns about the availability of the data, and I can only say that the data is available no matter where you come from.
It is available either through the Member States or on the internet, so there is no secret about the data collected in the different areas.
Concerning the budget, I think that it is important, in a situation where we have a limited budget for agriculture, that we take care to spend the money in the most appropriate way and that (I refer to Mr Martinez) we can defend how we spend the money and ensure that no fraud is taking place.
I think that we have also been quite successful in explaining to the European Parliament how we spend the money and how the control is carried out.
However, it is equally important for me to say again tonight that the technology used in the system to register the field crops does not make it possible to use the same system for control purposes.
The technology is completely different and the picture is simply unusable for control purposes, so please do not make this link, because it is completely inappropriate.
However, I still believe that the money that we will spend in the future on this system is justified.
It will be approximately between EUR 1.5 million and EUR 1.7 million every year.
Especially in a situation where we have seen dramatic changes in the price fluctuations in the agricultural sector, it is important that we have valid data on which to base our forecasts.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, under the new system the rapporteur has the last word, and therein lies an insight into how the European Parliament sees itself in relation to the Commission.
As you know, we are not at odds about the next steps in this matter.
I am not suggesting that the system be scrapped; I have merely proposed a few improvements - which I do not intend to recapitulate - to increase Parliament's powers of scrutiny.
On the question of data that can be used for climate analysis, we have indicated that there are two pilot projects, entitled LUCAS and MARS.
This also demonstrates, however, that the data being collected does indeed transcend the domain of agriculture.
This is why I asked in the explanatory statement for the retention of a separate budget heading.
Let me conclude with a little anecdote that shows the sort of thing we must deal with.
A farm near where I live was visited by the supervisory authority, because the satellite system had allegedly enabled it to identify a gully, in other words a prohibited drainage system.
The inspectors said it must be over there in a particular spot where the system had shown it to be.
The farmer, however, assured them that he had done nothing.
And what had actually happened?
A plastic mat was lying in the field - which should not happen either - and the grass had grown through it.
That was what the satellite system had picked up, and now the authorities had come to haul the farmer over the coals.
We politicians could surely come up with more little tales like that from our local areas - and no doubt, Commissioner, you have heard a few yourself - which illustrate what we have to deal with.
There is no point in denying our concern at the prospect of farmers being monitored in a way which the public cannot comprehend and which is no longer subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
I therefore hope you will appreciate why we have had to put this report through Parliament and discuss it and why we must continue to be vigilant in future.
Be that as it may, we do intend to support each other in these efforts.
I declare the debate closed.
Voting will take place on Wednesday, 16 January 2008.
Status of elected MEPs in Poland (debate)
The next item is the debate concerning an oral question to the Commission from Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B6-0002/2008) concerning the status of MEPs elected in Poland.
author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue that we are discussing tonight has been examined in detail, on more than one occasion I may say, by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I have the honour to chair, and that Committee has asked me, through this question, to open a discussion and to exchange views with the Commission.
The question relates to the status of MEPs elected in Poland, who are not in the same position from the point of view of elections and all the provisions that govern the elections of other parliamentarians in other Member States.
Elections to the European Parliament in Poland are in practice governed by the Act of 23 January 2004, Article 9 of which sets out eligibility requirements: candidates must be aged 21 on the day of the poll, must not have been convicted of criminal offences, must be resident in Poland and must satisfy various other criteria.
Chapter 17 of that Act sets out the circumstances in which Polish MEPs may lose their seats: their eligibility, that is the eligibility requirements on the day of the poll, may be invalidated, giving rise to the possibility of forfeiture if these requirements were not met, and various other matters, which I shall not cite in order to get to the crux of the matter that I should like to discuss here.
On the basis of a number of combined provisions, as we lawyers say, an MEP automatically loses his seat - that is, an MEP automatically forfeits that seat - if he or she has received a criminal conviction; in the case of members of the Polish Parliament, the law of 12 April 2001 - both as regards elections to the Sejm and to the Senate of the Republic - contains no provision of this type, with the result that these provisions relate to Polish MEPs but not to Polish MPs.
For that reason, we discussed the question and asked ourselves a question, a question which among other things has repercussions as regards requests for immunity; as you know, we have - as Commissioner Frattini is very well aware - the power to decide on this question.
Clearly, if a member automatically forfeits his or her seat as a result of an event for which immunity cannot be upheld, there is obviously a further problem, a further uncertainty.
For that reason, we ask, and I ask on behalf of the Committee, the Commissioner whether or not he considers that the Polish legislation on elections to the national parliament breaches Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, which states that during the sessions of the European Parliament, its members shall enjoy the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament in the territory of their own State.
There is therefore a clear inconsistency if provision is made for a Polish member to lose his or her seat, when members of the national parliament are not treated in the same way.
I would also ask the Commission if it intends to bring proceedings before the Court of Justice with a view to Poland amending this legislation and correctly applying the treaty, as it would seem that the treaty is not being applied as it should be.
As an exception is involved, and as the comparable and equal treatment of members from all the Member States means that this exception for members from the Polish state runs completely counter to what may be provided and is provided for all other members from the Member States, I would ask the Commission these two things and put this information before Parliament and ask whether the Commissioner can reply to these two questions and whether it is possible to find a remedy to the questions I have put.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue which Mr Gargani has brought up is undoubtedly an important one: it is important because two principles, both of which are relevant and important in my view, are at stake.
The first principle is undoubtedly that referred to in Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities and on the status of the members of the European Parliament, which specifies that in the States to which the members of the European Parliament belong, they must be accorded the same prerogatives as members of the national parliament of that country.
However, another provision is also involved - a provision which is also important in my view - and that is Article 13 of the European Act of 1976 relating to the election of members of Parliament.
That article very clearly states that when a Member State introduces national legislation covering the case in question here, that is the loss of the status, the loss of the position of member of the European Parliament, termination of the European parliamentary mandate in that country is subject to national law.
In other words, there is an apparent conflict, because the rules set out in the Protocol on Privileges, as cited by Mr Gargani, speak of equal prerogatives for members of the Polish Parliament and members of the European Parliament elected in Poland, but at the same time the European Act of 1976 on the election of members of the European Parliament, as regards the loss of the status of member of the European Parliament, apparently - or explicitly, I would say - governs the loss of the status of MEP and establishes that the loss of that status is governed by national law.
In my opinion, the problem here is more one of the infringement of a third guiding principle for the European Union: whether or not the principle of equal treatment is enshrined in Polish domestic legislation.
The principle, enshrined in the constitutional legislation of all the European countries, that establishes that similar situations must be treated in similar ways.
It is rather that general principle that is at issue; but that general principle does not, however, allow the European Commission to establish the way in which the Polish legal order should change its legislation, because, as the issue is subject to national law, if it were wished in national law to govern the loss of the status of national MP rather than the loss of the status of MEP in a different way, that would be possible, the important factor being that the provisions on one are brought into line with the provisions on the other.
This is my personal opinion in that the Commission cannot now say 'we are turning to the Court for a ruling that Polish national law has to be amended in a particular way', but I am of the view that a general principle can be drawn.
The general principle is that the Polish legal order must act to amend this difference in treatment and that, I believe, is a matter for the Polish legislator.
As this is a question that has never arisen and is too delicate to be dealt with in any summary way, I believe that the first step is to reach an understanding: if the Polish legislator, as I believe, should remove this difference in treatment, that is a matter for the Polish Parliament.
Second: does Polish legislation comply with the provisions of the European Act of 1976 which I cited earlier?
I can tell you, Mr Gargani, that I have commissioned a comparative study for the 12 new Member States to ascertain whether the legislation, not just Polish legislation, but the legislation of the 11 Member States which acceded to the European Union between 2004 and 2007, whether the national legislation in those Member States complies with the provisions of the European Act of 1976.
In conclusion, two tasks need to be undertaken.
First: a review, which I am undertaking, of the conformity of Polish national legislation, and not just Polish legislation, because the fact that Mr Gargani has brought up the case of Poland does not mean that there are not comparable situations in other Member States.
My view is that this review is needed for all of them.
The second task is to assess whether the Polish Parliament can, though legislation, remove what is objectively an apparent conflict, since there is an apparent discrimination between the status, regulated by law, of MEPs elected in Poland and Polish MPs.
There is an apparent conflict, and the only aspect that I believe would be difficult to accept is that it is up to the European Commission to ask the Court of Justice what action the Polish legislator should take.
Were Parliament to agree with this stance, we could simply point out that there is apparent discrimination in Poland between the status of two types of parliamentarian.
This is a very new exercise and we should try to make progress with it in a spirit of cooperation.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Chairman Gargani presented the situation of Members of the European Parliament in the context of Polish law very clearly, as also their unequal treatment in this same context as regards Members of Parliament in Poland, and also with regard to senators.
I would agree with the argument put forward by Commissioner Frattini that this violates the principle of equal treatment of Members of Parliament before the law.
I would like to inform you that the present ruling coalition in Poland, the Platforma Obywatelska and the Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe, has already begun work on changing this law so as to make it the same for Members of the European Parliament, Members of Parliament in Poland and for Senators.
This change will follow the same direction as the provision that is contained in the European Parliament's electoral law, so that the same principle also applies to Polish Members of Parliament and Polish Senators.
However, in this context, as Mr Gargani said that we are opening a discussion concerning a problem that may be a wider issue, I wonder whether it may be worth thinking about a common electoral law, at least in terms of general principles, a common electoral law for the European Parliament for all Member States of the European Union, as today there are very different circumstances in the 27 Member countries.
It is difficult to disagree, and of course I accept all legal restrictions as regards MEPs, but it is difficult for me to agree with a situation where, on being sentenced to a fine in a case brought by the public prosecution service for a deliberate crime, or for being charged with such a crime, a person automatically loses their mandate to the European Parliament.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, today's debate raises the issue of unequal treatment of Polish Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Sejm as regards election criteria, as well as that of loss of mandate.
In Article 9 of the Act of 23 January 2004 concerning the electoral ordinance for the European Parliament, we see that the right to stand for election to this institution is given to persons who, among other criteria, have not been convicted of a deliberate crime or charged by the public prosecution service, and Article 142 states that one's mandate can be withdrawn as a result, for example, of the member's election to the European Parliament being invalidated.
This means that the conviction of a Member (this refers to a Member of the European Parliament, as has been mentioned earlier) for a crime committed deliberately is equivalent to their automatically losing their mandate, while for members to the national parliament this does not act as an obstacle to them standing for election, nor does it result in the loss of their mandate.
As regards the privileges of Members of the European Parliament, Rule 5(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament states that 'Members shall enjoy privileges and immunities in accordance with the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities'.
In the Preamble, the Protocol states that it regulates the issue of privileges and immunities that are necessary to carry out responsibilities for the European Communities, and, in Article 10(a), states that, during the sessions of the Assembly, 'in the territory of their own State, its members shall enjoy the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament'.
Members of the Polish Parliament and the European Parliament are protected by the same immunity.
According to Article 11, 'Representatives of Member States taking part in the work of the institutions of the Communities, their advisers and technical experts shall, in the performance of their duties and during their travel to and from the place of meeting, enjoy the customary privileges, immunities and facilities'.
There is no doubt that a Member of the European Parliament is a representative of a Member State who is taking part in the work of the institutions of the Union.
Since Members of the European Parliament and of the Polish Parliament should benefit from the same immunities and privileges, then the rules as regards their eligibility to stand for election as well as for loss of mandate should also be the same.
In acceding to the European Union Poland assumed a responsibility to respect laws in force in the EU, especially those laws having a direct impact on the internal legal system in Member States.
I would encourage the fastest possible standardisation in legislation relating to the status of Members of the Polish Parliament and Members of the European Parliament in Poland, and I fully agree with the view taken by Commissioner Frattini in this regard.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the Polish electoral law on elections to the European Parliament is truly unfair and undemocratic compared to the law on elections to the national parliament.
The forfeiture of a seat of a deputy to the European Parliament by laws of eligibility is an easy way to put pressure on political opponents and gives the opportunity to settle an account politically with those who have more authority.
Unfortunately, although being in the European Union, the law is still abused in many former Communist countries.
This is the case for Mr Tomczak as well.
As Members of the European Parliament, Polish MEPs represent not only the Poles but also all Europeans.
It is unacceptable that these people's representatives are discriminated against by maintaining different legislation with regard to Members of the Polish Parliament.
A Polish MEP, if convicted, will be punished not only by Polish law but will also lose his seat as a Member of the European Parliament.
That fact clearly shows the discrimination of Polish Members of the European Parliament in comparison to members of national parliaments.
That situation is unacceptable and shows clearly how unjust and unfair the Polish electoral law is.
May I urge Poland to change its electoral law?
Mr President, this oral question is a consequence of the debates in the Committee on Legal Affairs on the immunity of Mr Tomczak.
The immunity of Mr Tomczak was raised by Parliament a few years ago.
Recently the Committee on Legal Affairs received a request from Mr Tomczak to defend his immunity.
The committee discussed this request and a draft decision has been prepared.
Nevertheless, the adoption of the final decision was postponed as the committee received information that, in the event of his immunity being waived, the legal consequences for Members of the European Parliament from Poland and Members of the Polish Parliament would be different.
According to the Polish Act of 23 January 2004, a Member of the European Parliament from Poland will lose his or her seat automatically in the event of criminal conviction.
For Members of the Polish Parliament this provision is not applicable.
Such a difference is in breach of European Community law, by maintaining different legislation with regard to members of the national parliament and Polish Members of the European Parliament.
This discrepancy between Polish and European Community laws needs to be clarified.
Therefore, I fully support the formulation of an oral question to the Commission.
I hope Mr Frattini will use all his influence to aim to eliminate this discrepancy between Polish and European Community laws.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that democracy in Europe needs to be constantly developed, and we are seeing many attacks on our democratic system from outside Europe.
The Members of the European Parliament take decisions, of course, on very many issues that have a direct and immediate effect on the European public.
Members of parliaments do not take decisions for themselves but represent their voters.
For this reason the Members of the European Parliament must not be inferior in status to members of national parliaments nor, conversely, should national deputies have a lesser status than MEPs.
For this reason I believe that the Commission should examine the impact on Poland's MEPs of the new statute that will apply from 2009 onwards and investigate what changes the statute will make and whether there is not some scope for its principles to be applied in order to remove these disparities.
(ES) Mr President, as ever, Commissioner Frattini has performed an intricate legal analysis.
As he said, in the current circumstances there would appear to be no grounds for bringing proceedings before the Court of Justice directly.
However, after listening to Mr Zwiefka, who has been telling us about a proposal from the current Polish Government to amend the law, I would ask the Commissioner whether he believes that the Commission could in fact approach the Polish Government on the basis of the debate we are having in Parliament at present to see whether the Polish Government is indeed proposing to amend the law to harmonise the status of MEPs with that of members of the national parliament.
(PL) Mr President, the proposal put forward by Mr Zwiefka to make the situation of Members of the European Parliament the same as Members of the Parliament in Poland does not provide a solution to the problem.
I believe that the best solution, which is in fact already part of Polish law, would be that in circumstances where a person is convicted of a deliberate crime, the court should also decide to deprive them of public rights, meaning that the person in question cannot stand for election.
This solution exists, for example, in France.
I would like to give you a specific example: our colleague, Mr Onesta, the Vice-President of the European Parliament, was sentenced a few months ago by a court in France to a suspended sentence of several months for an act that, under Polish law, would automatically mean the loss of one's mandate to the European Parliament.
I see the present situation as being completely wrong.
I think we should go in the direction of the solution proposed by Mr Frattini.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some further brief comments: I am pleased that the debate overall has recognised that there is a significant and thorny problem.
I should like, in particular, to thank Commissioner Frattini who, as the good lawyer that he is, has looked in more detail at the matter, which, as he rightly says, does not just relate to Poland.
There is a general principle at stake and I am therefore very content, as is the Committee, that you are undertaking an overall review to monitor compliance and to check whether laws are consistent as regards the national and the European question.

One fact is certain, however, there is not an apparent conflict since, as regards guarantees, the Polish law is contrary to the Treaty; if a Polish MEP were to lose his seat, obviously the article of the treaty which provides for the possibility of taking part in the sessions would fall.
From the Committee's own point of view, as you have heard in the debate just now from Mr Medina, and from me personally, the issue is not one of bringing proceedings, but of following up the question in order to resolve it.
If our Polish colleague, Mr Zwiefka, says that this matter has already been brought to the fore in Poland, some progress has already been made.
Comparability is what is needed, as that comparability makes Europe the guarantor of the unity of States that are working together, of citizenship and of equal rights from the point of view of freedom and everyone's status.
(PL) Mr President, just to add my support to the speeches, most of which I support, I believe that of course we should harmonise our regulations as soon as possible.
To illustrate how necessary this, is I would like to draw attention to the story of our colleague, an MEP, who is present here with us: Mr Tomczak, who has been involved in a criminal case in Poland for many years, which is now approaching a conclusion and could impact on his future as a Member of the European Parliament.
A case which does not involve much harm, and in which witnesses deny that the event took place.
A case that at one time was closed, which perhaps under the influence of some political turbulence has been reopened; and now, Mr Tomczak, who has twice been elected (our colleague became an MP in 2005, and an MEP in 2004), now, his immunity as well as his mandate may be removed.
This is something that is unbelievable, harmful and which should, as quickly as possible, be cut short and removed from this forum.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that tonight's debate has shown two things: the first is that there is a widespread view, which is shared, I would say, by all those who have spoken - and a view which I believe to be right - that the disparity of treatment between MEPs elected in Poland and Polish national MPs should be removed and that this analysis should be extended to all the other new Member States of the European Union whose compliance with the European Act of 1976 has not as yet been checked.
The second conclusion, and I refer to the proposal by Mr Medina Ortega, with which I agree, is to pass on the outcome of this debate to the competent authorities of the Polish Government, informing them that this disparity of treatment needs to be removed through national legislation.
I shall do that.
I can tell you that I shall certainly make formal contact with the Minister of Justice of the Polish Government in order to pass on the widespread opinion of this House - which I share - that while the Polish national legislator has sovereign powers over the way in which the elimination of this disparity of treatment is to be achieved, the objective of removing that disparity of treatment must be pursued.
That is the opinion that I put forward at the beginning: I do not consider that I can tell the Polish legislator how to proceed, but I do consider that I can spell out the objective, and that objective is to remove the disparity of treatment between the status of Polish national MPs and the status of MEPs elected in Poland.
I shall certainly pass on that information and I would add that I shall report back to this House, in view of the interest of Mr Gargani and the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the review of the other 11 new Member States so that the governments of other Member States that might be affected can then be notified accordingly.
The debate is closed.
Explanations of vote
The next item is clarification on the voting method.
(DE) Mr President, may I ask that the temperature in the chamber be set at a humane level.
At times it is so cold in here that we almost need to put on our coats.
I ask the administration to ensure that we have a decent temperature in which to work.
Thank you.
I would ask the staff responsible for the heating in the chamber to increase the temperature.
It might go up anyway during this item of discussion.
Oral clarification concerning voting
- (CS) Mr Chairman, I welcome the fact that we gave the green light to the modern framework for further development of the automotive industry in Europe.
I am pleased that we have voted for objectives that are realistic and that make provision for the increase in the price of oil and for our great ambitions regarding safety and protection of the environment.
The objectives do not hinder Europe's ability to compete.
Increasing requirements for safer and safer car designs and for more efficient engines that should emit one third less greenhouse gases are all objectives that already imply an increase in prices as well as an increase in the running costs of cars.
We are aware that these requirements in themselves are not the main motivation for the middle classes and for the less affluent to change their cars more frequently.
The elimination of old cars from the European roads is therefore the basic requirement if the CARS 21 is to prove its worth.
The key is to change consumer motivation.
Taxes and fiscal policies are not, however, entrusted to the European Union.
It will therefore be up to the Member States to carry the responsibility for setting the parameters.
It will be up to the Member States to determine whether and when safer and more environmentally-friendly cars will start taking the place of the old cars on our roads.
That would also be real proof of the effectiveness of CARS 21.
Written clarification concerning voting
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Polish colleague Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, asking Parliament to approve the amendment to the Council Regulation of 2004 on the establishment of partnerships in the framework of the stabilisation and association process.
The change entails renaming the partnership with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: instead of a 'European partnership' it is to be called an 'accession partnership' in order to align this with the name of the Partnerships with the two other candidate countries, Croatia and Turkey.
In addition, Montenegro's independence had to be taken into account.
As I compose this question, I am also thinking of Kosovo, in the hope that we may find a peaceful, European solution to the difficult situation there.
in writing. - (NL) In December 2005 the Council granted the status of candidate country to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and in June 2006 Montenegro was recognised as an independent state.
In an urgent procedure without debate, it is now proposed in Article 1 of the Regulation that Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia, including Kosovo, be granted a European Partnership and in Article 1(a) that Croatia and Macedonia be granted an Accession Partnership.
The definitions of those two arrangements are more or less the same.
The rapporteur supports the Commission proposal and asks the Council to consult Parliament again if it intends to depart from that proposal.
It seems to me a real possibility that it will depart from it.
It is not specified how account is to be taken of the anticipated recognition of Kosovo as an independent state in the next few weeks.
It is also not clear whether that means that Macedonia will have to wait longer for the start of accession negotiations, or whether Serbia is being offered the prospect of accession as a priority.
It is well known that the Netherlands and Belgium are opposed to that for as long as the war criminal Ratko MladiÄ has not been handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague.
I therefore expect that point to be put back on the agenda, but am not voting against the report.
in writing. - (PL) I would like to vote in favour of the report of Mr Liberadzki on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 95/50/EC as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
Mr Liberadzki has prepared an excellent report.
I agree with the rapporteur, who is in favour of the Commission's proposal, and would also recommend that the proposal should be approved without amendments.
Directive 95/50/EC sets out procedures for checks carried out by Member States as regards the transport of dangerous goods by road.
For the purpose of these checks a list of infringements has been proposed, in respect of which vehicles may be immobilised and required to be brought into conformity before continuing their journey.
In addition, it is important that each Member State send a report on the application of the Directive for each calendar year.
in writing. - (DE) Tolls imposed on heavy goods vehicles, supposedly introduced in order to shift traffic from road to rail, have predictably failed to make rail transport more appealing but have been offloaded onto consumers.
Particularly on the busiest routes and in large conurbations, the focus on road transport will exacerbate existing problems such as congestion, noise, environmental pollution and particulate concentrations.
Another cause for concern is the cavalier manner in which some transport operations are carried out.
Weekly targeted spot checks on lorries in Austria have greatly improved the safety of road haulage operations and should accordingly become standard practice throughout the EU.
If the European Union cares about the health of its population and protection of the environment, it must waste no time at all in ensuring that major pollution sources such as commercial utility vehicles with ageing diesel engines are replaced, that piggyback rail services are made economically attractive and that the Alpine Convention is implemented.
in writing. - (PL) The rapporteur, Paolo Costa, has shown how discrimination in transport rates and conditions can be abolished.
It is true that one can quickly achieve significant benefits by introducing just a few changes into existing legislation.
As a shadow rapporteur I would like to note that a common approach was reached by the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on airport charges, following the report of my German colleague Ulrich Stockmann.
At the point when European airports, which are mainly publicly owned, are being privatised, when users do not always wholly appreciate their consumption of services, and when companies are developing in a context involving many variables, it was quite natural to regulate the determination of airport charges.
I welcome the creation of independent national regulatory authorities to supervise this market, and I hope that European coordination will be rapidly established and that, in due course, an independent European regulator will come into being.
in writing. - (SV) The Commission proposals contain a long list of detailed rules on how airport charges should be collected.
It is one of the Commission's responsibilities to monitor compliance with Community competition legislation.
The proposals in question, however, mean excessive bureaucracy and detailed regulation, which is disadvantageous to those Member States which have chosen to deregulate the aviation sector.
The European Parliament considers that the common principles on airport charges should only apply to airports with over five million passenger movements per year, or to those at which annual traffic amounts to over 15% of the number of passenger movements in the Member State in question.
This position is preferable to the Commission proposal, which also includes smaller regional airports.
We are often called upon to decide whether to support common EU rules aimed at ensuring equal treatment of all interests participating in the internal market.
In this case it is clear that the Commission's line involves unjustified bureaucracy.
On the basis of these arguments, we have voted in favour of the proposal of the European Parliament, but against the legislative resolution in the final vote.
in writing. - (PT) Although it includes some points that improve the Commission proposal, the report continues to reflect and is an integral part of the process of air transport deregulation in the EU.
An improvement in transparency in the method of calculating airport charges is certainly to be welcomed.
However, we disagree with a policy that seeks to deregulate and privatise a strategic public service such as air transport, in this case promoting 'a truly competitive airport market', or the incorporation of principles such as the 'user pays' and profitability in a service that should be public.
What is more, efforts are even being made to remove its 'regulatory role' from the public arena, creating 'independent regulatory authorities' to that end.
The privatisations that have taken place in the sector have not added value to the services provided and have caused job losses and a deterioration in workers' rights, and in some cases technical and operational problems.
We regret that our proposals have been rejected.
They sought to ensure that the directive included recognition of the constraints faced by regions that suffer permanent geographic and natural disadvantages, such as the outermost regions, and therefore established appropriate exceptions for fulfilling universal public service obligations.
in writing. - British Conservatives are very much in favour of larger airports being subject to extra scrutiny where they hold a dominant market position.
However, we already have a strong regulatory system in the United Kingdom and we therefore feel that this is an unnecessary interference which could have an adverse effect on regional airports, which have a vital impact on local economies.
We have tried to improve the measure in order to maintain an 'opt out' on a national basis or at least to lift the threshold so that most regional airports are excluded, and although these attempts have not yet been successful, we will return to them at Second Reading.
In the meantime we will reserve our position.
in writing. - (DE) I did not vote for this report on the Airport Charges Directive, because what is being proposed here amounts to unacceptable discrimination against Luxembourg Airport.
This is no way to treat a small country.
The application of the directive to Luxembourg Airport, with its 1.6 million passengers a year, and the fact that its provisions do not apply to either of Luxembourg's direct competitors, Frankfurt Hahn and Brussels Charleroi, which process more than three million passengers, is intolerable discrimination in a single market and is based solely on the fact that a national border lies between Luxembourg and these other airports.
The key factor in this directive must not be national borders but objective criteria if its purpose is to ensure that no airport abuses a dominant market position.
Smaller airports, even if they are the only air terminal in their country, do not run the risk of perpetrating such abuse, especially in the case of Luxembourg, where the aforementioned rival airports lie within easy reach and, moreover, are used by budget airlines.
Luxembourg is so small that three different countries lie less than half an hour away from the airport by car.
This proposal is an imposed infringement of the proportionality principle which cannot be accepted as it stands.
That is why I am voting against the proposal by way of protest.
in writing. - I welcome the report and what it seeks to achieve.
Through the introduction of greater transparency in the way airport charges are calculated I feel it creates a level playing field and stimulates competition in the sector.
The plans will help Scotland's airports in competing with its British counterparts, especially by reducing the dominant position occupied by major travel hubs like London.
in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say, as a Member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, that I am in favour of the Stockmann report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on airport charges.
I consider it advisable, however, to make some comments in particular as regards the link between airport charges and the costs of the services offered.
In this respect, the delegations from France and the Netherlands, with Italian support, called for a clear reference to costs.
It should be noted here that Italian domestic law makes provision for a specific relationship between the costs of the services supplied and the charges levied by the managing body.
The provision of paragraph 5 makes the Italian system more consistent with the scheme of the directive, enabling current procedures to be maintained, provided that the independent regulatory body provided for in Article 10, which monitors the correct application of the charges, and the body which approves charging levels nationally are combined into the same authority.
That body, it has to be stressed, will have to be independent from both managing bodies and airline companies.
in writing. - While this report has a number of good ideas on making airport charges more transparent and bringing environmental considerations into the calculation for the first time, we must, as ever, be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water.
In my constituency, Scotland, we have dozens of small airports, and air travel is not a luxury - it is a necessity serving fragile communities.
I have therefore supported amendments to exempt airports in the outermost regions from the new regime, and look forward to the production of a framework that takes account of the fragile nature of many communities.
