Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I will join my fellow Members in thanking MrsÂ Krehl for the work she has done and in thanking you, MrsÂ HÃŒbner, for the quality of the relations we have had with you and with all of your services throughout the months that have led us to tomorrowâs vote. No one will be surprised as to how my group votes because, of course, we shall adopt this text, and we shall do so for at least two reasons.
Firstly, it takes account not only of the majority of the requests from our group, but also, I believe, of the requests from the majority of us.
Secondly, this matter has gone on for far longer than was scheduled, and it is therefore important that we adopt this text.
I should like to make four comments.
Firstly, I should like to point out to you â as my fellow Members have already done on several occasions â that, in ArticleÂ 1 of the text that was adopted on 18Â August by the Council, the words âto act as an indicative framework for the Member Statesâ are written in black and white, Commissioner.
I am aware that, as things currently stand, it is considered bad form to want to impose on the 25 Heads of State or Government directives that come from the Commission or Parliament.
I should, however, like to stress that we would have liked to have found some slightly more binding elements in this text.
As some of my fellow Members, such as MrsÂ Krehl, have said, we will make sure, at mid-term, that we formulate the points of view that will be needed to change the wayward paths that may have been taken.
Second point: I must emphasise the motivation for these strategic guidelines.
The contacts that I currently have refer me to a Brussels âtechnostructureâ and to a Parliament that decides on strategic guidelines.
All of that is very complicated.
People forget too quickly, far too quickly, that it is in fact thanks to these Structural Funds and to these guidelines that, in previous years â with Portugal, Spain and Ireland â we have achieved important results, and this for the benefit of human beings who experience unfavourable circumstances in disadvantaged regions.
They forget that our commitment to solidarity, which is being expressed today in this cohesion policy, is designed to allow all the communities and each and every inhabitant of the disadvantaged regions to have access to the same benefits as people in the more well-off regions.
I should like briefly to say how much I welcome the flexible approach announced at the very start of this text. It is an approach that, in taking account of the strengths and weaknesses of each region, should enable priority to be given to transport, to the environment and to energy, in particular.
Finally, like our fellow Members from the intergroup, who have already highlighted this point, we welcome the fact that this text emphasises the importance of cities.
Having been in Germany myself a few days ago, I am in a position to say â and my German fellow Members will correct me if I am wrong â that 90% of the German population live in towns or cities with more than 2Â 000 inhabitants.
In the text submitted to us, the importance of cities is emphasised.
What I should like to say is that, aside from the words, aside from the financial amounts that are going to be dedicated to the Cohesion Fund, there will be the means to use the fund.
Commissioner, in your communication on cohesion policy and the cities, you have reserved a special place for the integrated approach.
I should like to say, at this stage in the debate, that we must remain extremely vigilant and ensure, above all, that the implementation of the integrated approaches does not only affect the cities in the strictest sense of the word, but also the communities surrounding the cities.
We were talking about this matter with my fellow Member, MrsÂ Bourzai, who is present in this House, at lunch. It is not just the city that counts, it is all of the land that surrounds it, within a radius of 10, 20, 50 or 100 km, in which people live together on a daily basis.
If people are to live together harmoniously, the various topics concerning transport, society and education must be linked together effectively.
I shall conclude by saying that the actors must also have good links with each other: actors at national, regional, local and other levels. Just as an orchestra, with its violins and its pianos, needs a conductor in order to play well, we will ensure that there is a good conductor for all of these arrangements, one who is capable of making a success of this Cohesion Fund.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming so frequently to Parliament to discuss her proposals with us.
I would like in particular to thank Mrs Krehl for her work to bring some improvements to the Commissionâs original proposal, particularly in regard to partnership, the role of cities and their hinterlands, civil society, access for the disabled and the environment.
I must, however, reiterate concerns that I have raised repeatedly about earmarking, which remains central to the Commissionâs guidelines.
It has been and will continue to be used at Member State level to downgrade much of what Parliament has sought to do and what people have spoken about here this evening.
It champions Lisbon over Gothenburg and some elements of Lisbon over others.
In Ireland, at present, there is another concern, unrelated to the guidelines, which I take this opportunity to raise.
Namely, that in the future âPeace Programmeâ funding will be distributed in a way contrary to equality measures and equality provisions.
I hope to speak to the Commissioner further about this.
We need to remember the original reasons for these funds and programmes and to look at them again in the mid-term review.
As Mr Beaupuy reminded us, we in Ireland, north and south, experienced great benefits and great strides with the help of those funds.
We have to remember our solidarity and allow other areas to do the same in the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to congratulate MrsÂ Krehl on her work.
Today, in the European Parliament, we have discussed Romania and Bulgariaâs accession to the European Union.
In relation to that enlargement, I would like to highlight a statement contained in the introduction to the Councilâs decision. It reads as follows: âThe enlargement of the European Union to include 25 Member States is an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen both the economic competitiveness and the internal cohesion of the European Union.â
Of course, we should also be fully aware that at the moment, significant divergences remain in relation to wealth and the rate of development in certain regions.
However, barely 28 months after the accession to the European Union of 10 new Member States, we can already see that even the poorest regions are developing at a significantly faster rate and now have relatively high growth rates.
I speak as a citizen of one of these areas, the Podkarpacie region in south-eastern Poland.
The word cohesion does not mean homogeneity or uniformity, but rather it describes a state where a given structure remains an intrinsic whole without internal tensions or fissures.
This is my understanding of the European Unionâs cohesion policy.
Activities undertaken in the framework of efforts to foster solidarity between countries and nations within our Community will attain faster and greater success if there is a greater level of macroeconomic stability and essential structural changes are implemented in a more effective manner.
It is therefore vital to define the principles for cohesion for the entire European Union and correlate them with the strategic frames of reference created by individual countries.
Accordingly, we should welcome the fact that between 2007 and 2013, cohesion policy will aim to provide financial support for the least developed areas while also focusing on fostering economic growth and increasing employment.
I am pleased to see that the territorial dimension of cohesion policy has been emphasised, as it aims to create a balance between the development of urban and rural areas, as well as of regions with specific characteristics.
It will be extremely important to make sensible use of financial instruments, which is why the mid-term assessment will play such a significant role.
We should take a long-term view of our activities in Europe.
I therefore think that we need to breathe new life into the Lisbon Strategy.
We need to encourage innovation in all possible fields, we need to base our economy on knowledge and education and we need to foster entrepreneurship, irrespective of the size of the companies in question.
These are the approaches that will guarantee success.
However, we must remember that all our actions should treat people as individuals, as family members, as members of local and regional communities, as nationals of specific countries and as citizens of the whole Community.
This also applies to disabled people.
It is therefore very important to take account of the demographic dimension of cohesion policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, with the report by MrsÂ Krehl, whom I would like to congratulate on the work which she has done, we are finishing the legislation relating to the Structural Funds for the period from 2007 to 2013 and we are moving on to practice, in other words to the application of the legislation.
However, the question that arises is: is the legislation which we have voted through the best?
I say not. In my view, it could have been much better.
However, given the equilibriums which exist in this Union, of which our countries are Member States, this European Union of twenty-five states, I can say that it is the best possible legislation.
Consequently, we now have before us the challenge of seeing not only and merely how the 308Â billion cohesion budget will be taken up by the Member States and the regions, but also how they will make use of all this money.
Within this framework, the strategic guidelines which we are discussing today are important, because they refer precisely to the content of cohesion policy: where the money will be directed and which the priority sectors will be.
Of course, it is absolutely right for cohesion policy to be linked to the Lisbon Strategy and this is clearly expressed through the guidelines.
It would perhaps be better if the link had been clearer or more specific or if the Lisbon Strategy had been given a narrower definition, in order to cover certain truly leading sectors for the economy of the European Union.
In all events, the time of responsibility has come. The time of responsibility for the Commission, the time of responsibility for the Member States, especially for the ten new Member States which need to learn fast lessons in order to see how the Community Support Framework operates, and for us as far as control is concerned.
Our work does not end today. I would say that today is when it starts.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking our colleague, MrsÂ Krehl, for, and congratulating her on, her report and, in particular, on her first own-initiative report, which has enabled the European Parliament to voice its opinion on the guidelines on cohesion fairly early on, with the aim of being heard and of having an influence on the second version that has been proposed by the Commission and that we are debating.
It must be stressed, in fact, that the procedure has been slightly surprising.
While, at Community level, we had not yet adopted the strategic guidelines, the Member States were already in the process of preparing to adapt nationally.
Admittedly, the Member States were motivated by a legitimate desire to use the new Structural Funds from 2007, but this at the risk of a lack of overall consistency.
Indeed, the regional policy reform took place not only in the difficult context of the expansion and the renewal of the financial perspective, but also in the context of the revival of the Lisbon Strategy, something that clearly reoriented the objectives.
The fact is that reorienting them exclusively towards innovation, the knowledge-based economy, competitiveness and entrepreneurism is not enough to guarantee the objectives of territorial cohesion and sustainable development, which seem to me to take priority.
I deplore in particular the fact that the earmarking of the appropriations in relation to the Lisbon objectives, together with the classification of expenditure, should not have been made subject to the agreement of the European Parliament.
I also regret the fact that the territorial dimension of cohesion should not have been explicitly taken into account as a strategic guideline, even though I have fully noted the developments in relation to urban policy.
I am worried, however, about the gaps, the shortcomings in relation to the rural environment, the funds for which are not veryÂ âŠ
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community's strategic guidelines lay down the principles and priorities of the cohesion policy and suggest measures to allow the European regions to make full use of the EURÂ 308 billion appropriation allocated to national and regional aid programmes over the next seven years.
I should like to focus in particular on a factor that is decisive for the effectiveness of the cohesion policy: the quality of the partnership among all the local and regional actors involved in preparing and running the programmes.
Strategies drawn up at the closest possible level to the citizens really must form an integral part of the efforts to promote growth and employment.
The role of small and medium-sized enterprises, the need to fill local skills shortages, the importance of groupings and the need for local innovation centres are so significant that a bottom-up approach is crucial in most cases.
Involvement concerns not only the economic agenda, but also the more direct involvement of citizens through partnerships and the mechanisms of governance at various levels, in the context of which the cohesion policy is managed, in order to achieve the Unionâs objectives of growth and employment.
Closer cooperation between the Commission and the Member Statesâ authorities is crucial for drawing up a cohesion strategy that addresses Community priorities in a national and regional context and also for it to have a useful effect on the ground through an operational programme.
I also want to congratulate MrsÂ Krehl, who, with her usual competence, very skilfully stimulated debate on such an important topic as the subject of this recommendation.
I am pleased to note, Commissioner, that the strategic guidelines give due credit to the hard work done by Parliament over the last two years.
It is a result that we consider to be highly significant and important.
Indeed, they take into consideration important topics on which my fellow Members have focused and which have been examined in the relevant parliamentary committee and debated here in this Chamber.
To conclude, I hope, or rather expect, that my fellow Members will vote in favour of the legislative resolution and thus acknowledge all the hard work that has been poured into it.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to start by expressing my appreciation and congratulations to MrsÂ Krehl for this, an important component of cohesion policy for the coming years.
After all, it is the task of the strategic guidelines to supplement the Regulation governing the Structural Funds and to support the national and regional authorities in programme planning.
Consequently, these guidelines contain the political priorities for the investments to be made.
The new strategic guidelines rightly focus more than before on growth and jobs, with the emphasis on knowledge and information society, entrepreneurship and employment.
In other words, the priority here is the Lisbon Strategy, but I should like to emphasise that this is pursued never as an end in itself, but rather â within the framework of cohesion policy â always with a view to achieving the objective of strengthening economic cohesion and of pan-European competitiveness.
In so doing, these guidelines must also take account of the promotion of investment in individual businesses by means of subsidies designed especially for SMEs.
Concern must still be expressed about the considerable administrative burden in the field of European structural policy, which, unfortunately, is not significantly reduced by the requirements set out in these guidelines.
I should also like to emphasise that we must not only make intelligent, efficient, targeted use of the scant resources at our disposal, but also attach great importance to private cofinancing at project level.
Unfortunately, publicâprivate partnerships are still used much too rarely in connection with the Structural Funds, particularly because of a large number of unresolved legal issues.
We must now do our utmost, as quickly as possible, to enable countries to submit their operational programmes soon, and particularly to afford them a smooth transition to the new aid period.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by echoing the expressions of gratitude for the work of MrsÂ Krehl, thanks to which we have been able to reach a common position within Parliament, which has undoubtedly considerably improved the content of these strategic objectives.
This will allow us to enable the European regions to benefit as much as possible from the budgetary contribution allocated for that purpose, and we have proposed the bases for the national strategic frameworks, that is to say the search for a balance between growth and territorial cohesion.
We must not forget that Europe is made up of a large number of regions which have great similarities but which also have many special characteristics of their own, and we must take these into account from the point of view of cohesion: the urban environment and the rural environment, where agriculture is the main activity, the outermost regions, islands and regions suffering depopulation.
In short, the cohesion policy must be aimed at eliminating the specific difficulties faced by each of them, thereby guaranteeing equal opportunities.
Within the framework of the strategic guidelines, therefore, recommendations have been introduced which must be stressed: the creation of more and better jobs; innovation and the knowledge-based economy, which contribute to the elimination of the digital divide; environmental investments, which guarantee sustainability and the management of natural resources; transport infrastructures and accessibility, which allow equal opportunities to be offered to the people most in need of them, such as the elderly, the disabled and women.
The incorporation of these elements has been crucial to the proper implementation of the cohesion policy, and they will ensure that the objectives initially set are achieved.
Finally, we must point out that the principle of participation in the drawing up of European policy has been taken into account.
We will have thereby created the bases for mobilising the economic growth potential of all of the regions, with a cohesion policy that improves the geographical balance of economic development, increases the growth of the Union as a whole and ultimately lays the foundations for a stronger, more cohesive and more cooperative Europe.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we are hardly in any doubt as to the outcome of tomorrowâs vote on the strategic guidelines, which will probably gain the support of virtually all of our Assembly; I, like many others in this House, believe that the work of our rapporteur has got something to do with that.
It is, however, as everyone knows, quite late in the day to be talking about this, here and now.
The drafting of the operational programmes is already well under way in most countries.
Obviously, it is the result that interests us.
What will the Unionâs regional policy, which represents almost 40% of the Community budget, really be of use to: the Lisbon Strategy, territorial cohesion, or indeed both?
We hope that it will be of use to both.
It seems to me, at any rate, that the principle on which Parliament was not consulted â earmarking, which mainly concerns the old Member States â is one of the most technocratic and, in my modest opinion, undoubtedly one of the least intelligent ever thought up in Europe.
It is the combination of two technocracies, that of the Commission, whose skill in this area is renowned, and that of the Member States, which is as varied as it is developed.
What will come of this?
We can still hope for the best.
To do so, we shall have to wait for the Commission to examine the operational programmes submitted by the Member States, a process that will take months.
I hope that these programmes will respond first and foremost to the needs and to the will of the urban populations, and of the rural populations, to which they apply.
We know that you are paying attention, Commissioner, to these well-founded concerns.
Let us hope that you can convince your interlocutors and colleagues of this.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Community Strategic Guidelines for cohesion is one of the most important documents for planning structural fund spending in the Member States of the European Union.
This document outlines the main priorities for countries applying for cohesion fund aid between 2007 and 2013.
The guidelines provide the basis each Member State needs in order to draw up a strategic frame of reference defining national development priorities.
These guidelines will direct future cohesion policy measures towards improving competitiveness so as to foster economic and employment growth.
In order to achieve this objective, the European Union must primarily focus on knowledge, innovation and investment in human capital, as well as on work aimed at eradicating disparities between levels of development in particular regions.
Making effective use of available funds is a key task and involves measures such as fostering public-private partnership programmes, especially at a local level.
It is also extremely important to pay particular attention to the urban dimension, as it is in towns and conglomerations that problems such as crime, social exclusion, pollution or heavy traffic generally make themselves felt.
This House should be satisfied with the current version of the strategic guidelines.
We can now only hope that the Member States will be able to effectively implement cohesion policy on the basis of these guidelines.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Krehl, on a very thoroughly prepared document.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to sing the praises of MrÂ Krehl's report and the results that have now been incorporated in the directive, including those achieved in the past two and a half years by MrsÂ HÃŒbner in the debate at European level.
I am in favour of earmarking; we should be able to admit to this in this Chamber, and I am the first to do so.
This also means, though, that we can eliminate the noncommittal dimension and fragmentation to the left and right in policy.
In doing so, we can update the cohesion policy to include it in a new agenda: that of Lisbon.
The emphasis is shifting from less concrete and less asphalt to training our people in knowledge society.
We will, in the next 20 years, need to focus on cut-throat competition at world level.
Central will then be the role of Parliament in this new era, with an interim review in 2009-2010.
What we can then look forward to is agriculture being weighed up against cohesion policy and against Europeâs external role in the world.
The focus will then be even more on the policyâs added value.
It is because of that role that in the committee, I pledged my support to the amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that looks to enhance Parliamentâs role during reassessment.
I am also asking the Commissioner and the European Commission whether we will have sufficient information at our disposal in order to be able to hold a proper debate on the financial reprioritisation.
I am asking you for information about what the nation states are now doing.
I sense a reluctance among our Member States to report adequately, and I regard that as a real disgrace.
They are given the instruments and should respond accordingly.
It is true that the new synthesis for the new era and the new financial proportions will require a significantly reassessed policy, as well as a permanent role for the regions and the towns in the cohesion policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a decision on strategic guidelines on cohesion, to which we have been asked to give a favourable response, and which will serve as the basis for drawing up national strategic reference frameworks, strikes me as an excellent statement of intentions for the Council, for which we must thank MrsÂ Krehl.
The strategic guidelines make it clear that Europe needs to concentrate on meeting the Lisbon Strategy objectives, which are of course close to my heart, in terms of both fostering employment and growth, and encouraging innovation and a knowledge-based economy.
In our quest to meet the challenges facing the EU on the world stage and in light of our new size and scale, we must always ensure that all parties are involved, be they social partners, NGOs, local authorities or regional authorities.
We have become a giant with ambitions to match our size and we cannot afford to neglect any part of the territory; together, we must meet the objectives that we have set ourselves.
We have to prove that the classic, multi-level model of our society is sufficiently sound.
Full employment, a qualified workforce, lifelong training and increased productivity are essential prerequisites if economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU is to be a success.
For this to happen, these factors must be embraced by all of us in a spirit of cooperation.
The report gives due prominence to the factors of investment in innovation and researchers by means of incentives to encourage such talented people to remain in Europe, and the setting up of centres of excellence; these are vital tools for economic development in the regions and the Member States.
There is an increasing awareness of the need to decentralise knowledge hot-spots, away from the large population centres towards the less populated areas.
Such areas may prove highly conducive to the establishment of centres of excellence.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Communityâs strategic guidelines for the upcoming seven years that are before us represent a considerable step, and are particularly helpful in shaping the new Member Statesâ cohesion policy, which will ultimately mean a more unified and cohesive Europe for all of us within a few years.
The European Parliament has acted with the greatest possible speed in preparing the Communityâs strategic guidelines, and now it is up to the Member States to draw up the best, most credible and most feasible national development plans possible, and to submit these to the European Union.
Allow me to draw attention to a few aspects of the document which did not receive much emphasis earlier, and which therefore did not constitute the same sort of incentive when the Member States were drawing up their own development plans.
I would like first to mention the part of the document which stresses the broad participation and involvement of the various civil and professional organisations, and urges giving equal say to all in the process of preparing Member Statesâ national development plans.
The perspective according to which health is considered an economic value and a motor of development represents a great advance in the document, which recommends the same approach in preparing national development plans.
Today health no longer means simply improving the health care system or making it more accessible, but includes creating more and better jobs, the goals of sustainable development as well as the principle of equal opportunity already mentioned.
The attention to improving the transparency and accountability of European Union support is a very important step forward, and thus strengthens trust among the Member States.
We all know what an enormous job it is to prepare such a document.
For my part, I can only thank and congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Krehl, and the shadow rapporteur, MrÂ Olbrycht, for their excellent work.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, reducing the disparities among regions, and particularly border regions, is an important challenge for the Communityâs strategic guidelines.
With this in view, we should emphasise the actions that will have a long-term impact, such as those carried out not only within the transport and environment sectors, but also in connection with the Lisbon Strategy, regarding support for SMEs and the cross-border labour market.
It is regrettable, however, that, in this quest for balanced development, the border regions underpinning regional policy should sometimes be very different entities in terms of size and population and may have significant disparities linked to the statistical nomenclature.
That can in fact result in unequal amounts being allocated from the Structural Funds, and there is, then, a great risk that strengthening the competitiveness of these cross-border regions â one of the priorities of cooperation â might turn into a form of fierce competition among neighbouring regions.
The inequalities in development that could result on both sides of the borders would be liable to harm the European Unionâs cohesion policy, even though one of the aims of this policy is to mitigate the negative effect of having borders.
How, in this case, can we enable the citizens concerned to recognise the added value of the European Union?
It is therefore imperative that we create the ideal conditions for balanced cross-border economic and social development and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving this cross-border cooperation.
Finally, I should like to conclude by thanking MrsÂ Krehl for her report and, above all, for her boundless enthusiasm in championing a form of lasting cohesion.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the strategic guidelines on cohesion and the three priority areas identified.
Like everybody else, I compliment the rapporteur, Mrs Krehl.
As an Irish Member of the European Parliament and coming from an economy that has been transformed in 15 years from the weakest in the EU to one of the strongest, I wish to acknowledge the huge role that the cohesion and structural funds have played in bringing about the economic miracle known as the âCeltic Tigerâ.
The EUR 308Â billion for 2007-2013 will go largely to the new Member States.
Irelandâs entitlement is reduced from EUR 3.7 billion for 2000-2006 to EUR 901 million, which is a barometer of our economic success.
I have no problem with that.
However, I should like to ask my colleagues in the new Member States not to give their national governments the power to decide at central government level how and where the money is to be spent.
They need regional structures with real development power, real decision-making powers for the regions.
I speak from experience.
I represent a constituency in Ireland known as the BMW region.
It is one of the poorest regions, bordering the Atlantic Ocean and largely mountainous.
It is still the only region in Ireland that retains Objective 1 status, though that, through national economic performance, ceases on 31 December 2006.
Over the years, funds that flowed from the cohesion and structural funds and were intended for regions such as mine were channelled to Dublin, the east and the south of the country and co-financed national development plans.
I do not exaggerate.
EUR 680 million of co-financed monies intended for the BMW region have gone to Dublin, the east and the south.
Why?
Because in Ireland there is no regional authority with real decision-making powers.
Everything is decided in Dublin at central government level.
Now is the time for the new Member States to ensure that they have real regional authorities â not just paper tigers â otherwise they may find that the Irish experience will be their experience tomorrow.
Commissioner HÃŒbner reiterated that this evening.
I think it should happen, it must happen, and the Commission has a role here as well in insisting that it does happen.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate MrsÂ Krehl on her excellent report on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines.
The report was a vital factor in the Council welcoming a number of Parliament's positions, on issues such as sustainable development, the urban dimension, equal opportunities and renewable energy sources.
For this and other reasons, MrsÂ Krehl is justified in recommending that Parliament vote in favour.
Once this Council decision has been adopted, the Member States will not have much time to submit their strategies for implementing the Structural Funds, incorporating these Community guidelines, to the Commission.
It is regrettable that this tight schedule may adversely affect the implementation of the new cohesion policy as of January 2007.
I should also like to say that I endorse the proposed guidelines and priorities, and in particular the idea that cohesion policy is a vital tool for implementing the Lisbon Strategy.
Let us not forget, however, that the Lisbon Strategy is primarily based on the notion of promoting European competitiveness, as opposed to the notion of solidarity on which the cohesion policy is based.
It will not always be easy to work with these two different approaches in tandem, but a balance needs to be struck.
Accordingly, I have serious doubts about the idea of obliging the old Member States to set aside high percentages of the funds for meeting the Lisbon Strategy objectives, and, at the same time, to promote an effective cohesion policy, not least in the area of territorial cohesion.
I trust, therefore, that the national strategies to be submitted succeed in achieving the best possible balance between competitiveness and solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, cohesion funding has been very important in underpinning the success of the 2004 enlargement and, like others, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work in that area.
The economic progress seen over recent years in the EU-15 Member States that enjoyed cohesion funding represents something of a model for what we can do when EU resources are properly targeted and implemented.
While the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda is largely a matter for the Member States, I am nevertheless pleased that the strategic guidelines set out an ambitious programme for growth and jobs, which we hope will be realised throughout the European Union.
When the ten new Member States joined in 2004, we welcomed their membership for various reasons, not least because those countries in central and eastern Europe had marked a major milestone in their remarkably short transition from the horrors they had experienced under communism to democracy.
We welcomed enlargement in the political sense.
However, we also recognised that if enlargement was to work it would be necessary to provide adequate funding for the new Member States in order to boost their economies, thereby creating growth and jobs.
I am pleased that we are using tried and tested mechanisms of structural and cohesion funding to achieve that important goal.
The United Kingdom Government announced last year that it would offer an extra EURÂ 8Â billion over the 2007-2013 budget period to help the new Member States build their economies and societies.
While my constituents in Northern Ireland recognised that enlargement would bring with it a financial burden on the richer Member States, they were also keen to ensure that funding is allocated in ways that will bring sustainable improvement throughout the entire European Union.
We appreciate that the economic development of eastern Europe will in the longer term bring economic advantages for all of us.
As someone from Northern Ireland, I would just like to say that the people there were very envious of the cohesion funding received by the Republic of Ireland, because it certainly helped that country.
It is an awful pity that Parliament, the Commission and the Council did not listen to us in the past when we asked for cohesion funding for Northern Ireland.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Communityâs strategic guidelines on cohesion are an extremely important document, which should contribute towards finalising national framework reference strategies regulating the draw-down of structural funds in the individual Member States.
Unfortunately, however, the adoption of this document has been greatly postponed in comparison with the original timetable.
National materials are now ready in most Member States and logically this document cannot be formally implemented while they are being drawn up.
This will lead to further complications throughout the process.
Concerning the implications for the preparation of operational programmes and their necessary adoption by the Commission, we should be aware that the programming will now be delayed, thereby postponing the prospect of risk-free draw-downs of financial resources from the Structural Funds for individual Member States.
On the other hand, it must be said that these strategic principles take on board the great majority of our comments.
I am especially pleased that the crucial role of local authorities in particular, that is to say the towns and cities, has not been overlooked in the process of improving competitiveness across the Community as a whole.
I feel that this declaration will not merely gather dust, and that we will all strive to ensure that the principle of partnership between national administrations, regions, communities and other entities is fully honoured in all Member States.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is still much work to be done on explaining certain aspects such as, for example, the programming method for the urban dimension.
In future, the form of the integrated urban plans must be clarified, so that there is no miscommunication and so that the goalposts are not moved, as was the case with the release of aid aimed at improving municipally-owned waterworks infrastructure in the Czech Republic.
I should like to conclude with a vote of thanks to MrsÂ Krehl.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the most recent enlargement, through which the EU gained ten new Member States, at the same time brought to the Community deeper differences in economic development, a geographical shift of inequality to the east, a doubling of socio-economic differences and a drop in average GDP. This is in spite of the fact that the new Member States actually have some of the highest rates of economic growth.
With the impending accession of Romania and Bulgaria, whose GDP stands at a third of the current EU average, I believe that we now need the strategic guidelines on cohesion more than ever.
European solidarity is referred to in the preamble of the Treaty on the European Union, which specifies that the Community will strengthen its economic and social cohesion with a view, above all, to reducing differences in the level of development between different regions.
The EU earmarks over a third of its budget to reducing differences in development between different regions, as well as inequalities in the standard of living.
Through the fund, the EU is contributing towards the development of regions that are lagging behind, the restructuring of industrial regions and the revitalisation of neglected urban areas.
The reform of cohesion policy should offer the opportunity for greater effectiveness, transparency and political accountability.
In the next programming period, cohesion policy must be clearer and more coherent and I personally expect it to become more goal-orientated and focused.
Concerning the countries in receipt of support from the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds, it is necessary to take account of enlargement and to distinguish between the various kinds of action supported by the funds.
Â Â  Mr President, while I believe that the guidelines now take on board Parliamentâs main concerns, as you know we were not in a position to accommodate all of them fully.
I am thinking in particular of certain provisions that are now enshrined in the regulations and which cannot, by definition, be contradicted in the guidelines.
Certainly earmarking is perhaps the principal example of such a provision which Parliament has tended to oppose, but let me emphasise very strongly that earmarking is not anti-cohesion.
It is a recognition that the world has changed and that we need to redirect efforts towards new priorities in order to achieve sustainable cohesion.
At the same time, compared to the Commissionâs initial proposal, the final list of earmark categories has been enlarged during the negotiations to include other expenditures, especially in the convergence regions, but not only those regions.
In addition, the regulations now provide for the possibility, during the programme negotiations, for the national authorities and the Commission to agree to earmark other expenditure categories that do not appear on the final list, where these are held to be of national or regional importance.
We are now on the home strait with regard to the implementation of the EU cohesion policy.
We have the regulations in place and by the beginning of October, assuming Parliamentâs assent tomorrow, the guidelines will be adopted as a first phase in the programming exercise.
While it is the home strait, we should not underestimate the challenges that lie ahead in reaching the finishing line, but I can assure you that I will spare no efforts in persuading our partners in the Member States and regions to put in place ambitious and innovative programmes.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  â First of all, I would like to thank all my colleagues, the colleagues at the Commission and the Council and of course MrsÂ Krehl for the effort they have made on behalf of improving the guidelines.
The essence and the real achievement of the agreement, from the perspective of the regions, micro-regions and cities of the new Member States, is that their situation has convincingly improved.
Sources can be used:
â with greater certainty (counting with greater certainty on a 2007 start, and planning on full operation)
â with greater ease (with much less individual effort and more favourable regulations)
â in a customised fashion (new specific goals such as home renovations, mass transit, road building).
Areas of development are expanding, there is greater freedom of choice in their uses and value â this significantly increases our chances for dynamic growth and cohesion.
Out of 27 countries, mine ranks second highest in the amount of cohesion/convergence support per head, out of which development worth at least 8Â billion Ft can be realised.
In the regulations aimed at our cohesion and thus in the strategic guidelines as well, the majority of Hungaryâs requests and proposed amendments formulated in the committees of Parliament and the Council received support, indeed we even received things we did not request or even hope for.
All the conditions are present for the regions of Europe that are still lagging behind to align themselves with the front line.
Continued success depends on whether we manage to build our country with the kind of collaboration one finds in Brussels, and whether we will be able to deal with the real issues, so that instead of futile arguments, we will be able to raise Hungary and the other new Member States to the rank of Europeâs top players.
It is now up to usÂ âŠ
Â Â  â Statistics show that between 1988 and 2001 the gap between the poorest regions and the EU average was narrowed by one-sixth, precisely because of the results achieved by the cohesion policy.
The year 2005 was a record year for the cohesion policy in terms of resources invested, with a total of EURÂ 38.3Â billion committed to the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund and the pre-accession fund for candidate countries (ISPA).
In the same year, the reform of EU regional policy achieved notable results, including its official recognition as an instrument for growth and employment under the Lisbon Strategy.
Recent research shows that the overall growth in GDP in the new Member States from 2007 to 2013 will be in the region of 7-12%, and that 2.5Â million jobs could be created.
The new strategic guidelines approved in this Chamber today focus more on growth, showing that in future the cohesion policy should place the emphasis on the knowledge and information society, entrepreneurship, the environment and employment, in order to promote the even more balanced and sustainable development of the Community.
Â Â  â I am grateful to the European Commission for having significantly enhanced the inclusion of the territorial dimension of cohesion policy in the latest version of its strategic guidelines.
I endorse the Commissionâs desire to seek mechanisms for executing cohesion policy that will help guarantee that all regions are treated fairly on the basis of their individual capacities in relation to factors of competitiveness.
For the next generation of programmes, territorial cohesion must be promoted in such a way as to allow Europe as a whole to contribute to the measures in favour of growth and employment, thanks in particular to high-quality partnerships gathering together actors at every level: national, regional, urban, rural and local.
The new legislative framework also makes provision for a special allocation to be granted to the outermost regions in order to take account of the high costs they incur as a result of being so remote.
I concur with the Commissionâs objective, which consists in ensuring that this allocation will also help create sustainable growth and employment in the outermost regions.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by MrsÂ Barsi-Pataky and MrÂ RÃŒbig on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, MrÂ Glante on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, MrsÂ Hall on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and MrÂ Pirilli on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on taking stock of the Galileo programme (O-0094/2006 â B6-0430/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President, a year ago the European Parliament voted here in Strasbourg at first reading on the financing of the GALILEO programme, and on the whole it unanimously supported the programme.
A great success of the past year has been the fact that the GIOVE-A satellite went into orbit and occupied its frequency.
Our gratitude goes to the European engineers and developers.
Discussions regarding the realisation and operation of the project are under way, and Parliament takes note of the Commissionâs communication to the effect that the first result of these talks will be the so-called âhead of termsâ regarding its financing, which is to come before us before the end of this year.
We request the Commission to do everything possible in the interest of fulfilling the common objective of financing the GALILEO programme by a two-thirds/one-third split between private capital and the Commission.
Despite the results, we must express our concerns.
The programme is considerably delayed.
We realise the significant difficulties which the Commission faces daily.
The European legal and regulatory system is difficult to use when it comes to realising a joint project.
Furthermore, it is our experience that this is a new and difficult task, as regards financing, risks and operations, for the European space industry selected to carry it out.
We agree that the European GALILEO programme has entered the global sphere and has offered its services worldwide.
If, however, cooperation with third countries is also to figure in the overall institutional transformation of the Supervisory Authority, then the European Parliament wishes first to give its opinion on this matter.
We, the various political groups in the European Parliament, consider that what the GALILEO programme now needs is what is known as âgood governanceâ.
For this reason, I wish to ask the President and Vice-President what the Commission plans to do to ensure that this promising programme, which is one of the vehicles for the Lisbon Strategy, will be realised without further delay.
When will the regulations on its uses be ready, allowing European undertakings to prepare in sufficient time for the participation that is the key to the success of the entire programme?
Â Â  Mr President, I, like Mrs Barsi-Pataky, am also particularly concerned about the issue of timing.
Delay is absolutely critical, because Galileoâs unique attractiveness to investors is lost once the American GPS 3 system has reached operational capability, which is estimated to be in about 2015.
I should be grateful if the Commissioner would spell out to what extent the delay is going to be detrimental to Galileoâs success in the international market for satellite navigation.
I am concerned that the delay undermines Galileoâs business plan in other respects as well.
Firstly, with the delay have come increased costs.
Indeed, the costs of Galileo have already exceeded the budget by over 40%.
Secondly, the delay undermines the potential for revenue.
The most important source of revenue is expected to be royalties from intellectual property rights.
Receiving manufacturers would pay a licence fee to the Galileo-operating company in order to have their receivers Galileo-enabled.
But what manufacturer will want to pay a licence fee for Galileo if it does not offer any added value when compared to an upgraded GPS?
Therefore, delay to the Galileo programme is not just unfortunate: it could have really grave consequences for the financial burden which is carried by the public purse.
I should be very grateful if the Commissioner could give us some explanation on this.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all I should like to thank MrsÂ Barsi-Pataky and MrsÂ Hall, as well as MrÂ RÃŒbig and MrÂ Glante, who should be with us soon.
I am grateful to them, and particularly to MrsÂ Barsi-Pataky, for the close attention they have paid to the development of this great Galileo programme.
I will try to provide you with some specific answers, because I should like to put to rest certain fears that, in spite of everything, seem to me to be rather excessive.
I would remind you that the Galileo programme was designed in three stages.
First, there is a development and validation phase, involving the development of the satellites and terrestrial components of the system and their in-orbit validation.
This development phase runs from 2003 to 2009, and is currently being managed by the Galileo joint undertaking.
This will be followed, from 2009 to 2010, by the deployment phase, involving the production and launching of the satellites and the full instalment of the terrestrial component.
Finally, the operating phase will start in 2010.
The deployment and operation phases will be covered by a concession contract lasting around 20 years.
The Supervisory Authority, which is a Community agency, will manage these two phases, and will act as the licensing authority.
Within this schedule, there is one date to which we absolutely must stick â and on this point you are quite right â namely the date from which businesses and citizens will be able to receive accurate and reliable signals from Galileo.
That will be at the end of 2010, when the first Galileo satellites will start transmitting their signals.
That said, I have no intention of glossing over the difficulties.
Galileo is not only a technological innovation, but also, at institutional level, a very particular operation.
The project now involves eight industrial players, 25 public players and three institutions.
In the long term, this multiple patronage will be Galileo's strength, but it is true that all of these players, all of these supporters of Galileo, will really need to adapt in order to make progress on the matter together.
When, in 2005, I observed the problems between the eight members of the future industrial consortium, I appointed KarelÂ vanÂ Miert to resolve the problems, which he did with remarkable success.
We also needed to deal with the changes in safety and security requirements that necessitated a further delay for technical examination.
Be that as it may, the important thing is the result in 2010.
Having said that, we also need to make steady progress in the schedule of intermediate steps, paying close attention to the quality and viability of the project.
For example, the industrial activities of the in-orbit validation phase, which are the responsibility of the European Space Agency, began in December 2004.
The contract regarding the completion of this phase was signed on 19Â January 2006, and the work is currently progressing satisfactorily.
The technical feasibility of the project has been proven, and it is now a question of laying the foundations for a true public/private partnership for the next 20 years.
It goes without saying that I will inform you of any problems that arise regarding the signing of the concession contract.
I should now like, in response to your second question, to turn to the European Supervisory Authority.
This is the authority responsible for supervising the future concessionaire.
The Supervisory Authority will have to ensure that the concessionaire complies with the concession contract and the annexed terms and conditions, and it will take all appropriate measures to ensure that services are not interrupted if the concessionaire goes bankrupt.
In addition, the Supervisory Authority will also have to monitor all the technical, security and financial aspects of the concession.
In this regard, I would say that the wording of the concession contract is obviously very important, because it will be the primary instrument on which the Supervisory Authority's ability to monitor the concessionaire will be based.
The concession contract must therefore be worded quite unambiguously, and I will of course inform Parliament of it, as the Commission has made a commitment to inform you of the content of the concession contract before it is signed by the Supervisory Authority.
Two final problems remain to be addressed: first of all, the financial issue.
The distribution of financial contributions between the Member States and the industrial players is largely dependent on the risk assessment, but this assessment itself requires the best possible understanding of Galileo's possible applications.
That is why, by the end of November, I will publish a communication in the form of a Green Paper on these applications.
For that purpose, we have come up with a competition to appeal to the imaginations of the European people regarding the possible applications of Galileo.
I am quite sure that we are still underestimating the potential of Galileo, and I would urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to make efforts yourselves to encourage all our European industries to contribute to this discovery of the possible applications of Galileo.
The second problem is that of cooperation with third countries.
As you will be aware, the international agreements regarding the Galileo programme are negotiated on the basis of ArticleÂ 300 of the Treaty.
The procedure laid down in that article must always include consultation of Parliament before such agreements are concluded, and I will see to it personally that this takes place.
It is quite certain that cooperation with third countries regarding Galileo represents an opportunity, but this opportunity must be managed, and the Commission will send another communication to Parliament and the Council this autumn, setting out the broad outline of this cooperation policy.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to gloss over the difficulties that go hand in hand with the implementation of a project as ambitious as this one, but at the same time I would draw your attention to the risks involved in giving the impression that this programme will in some way be subject to crucial delays that cast doubt on the viability of the project.
That is not the case, and nor will it be, because I personally intend, with your help, with the active support of Parliament, to ensure that this great project can be put into practice in accordance with the schedule that we set to guarantee its viability, because you are quite right that there will be no shortage of competitors.
Galileo therefore needs to be put into operation within the timeframe I have set out.
I really will keep a close eye on this throughout the procedure, aided and supported by your Parliament.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am particularly pleased that we are discussing this topic â albeit at this late hour â because it is indeed the case that we need to get our skates on.
We must keep the momentum going, not least in view of global competition.
MrsÂ Barsi-Pataky already gave an excellent outline of the framework with regard to the possible delay, the legal framework and so on. I hope you will allow me briefly to dwell on this public-private cooperation this evening.
It is estimated that a future-oriented project such as this can yield 150Â 000 extra jobs, and I know that industry cannot wait to take part in it.
Moreover, there are also regions in Europe â Bavaria and North Netherlands for example â that are prepared to invest money from the structural funds in developing this further.
That has also been done before for the LOFAR radio telescope project in North Netherlands.
As you, MrÂ Barrot, will know, since you have been Commissioner for Regional Policy, structural funds must, more than ever, be invested in technologies and information.
Would you be prepared to take over this development of decentralised involvement and funding?
You have mentioned a Green Paper.
Could that be the bridge that can bring about this acceleration?
I am also mindful of the new rules for state support.
MrsÂ Kroes outlined possibilities for projects of this kind a moment ago.
I think that we are under-using the other instruments in this Parliament and in the European Union.
Galileo is still in pole position globally.
Europe is still ahead, but Galileo cannot afford to fall flat on its face in the implementation stage.
Galileo should not carry on drifting, it must land.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its explanations; I believe that it has grasped that we are worried about the situation with the Galileo programme â which is similar to what is happening in the case of Airbus, for example.
That is the true purpose of the debate.
Time planning and compliance with the timetable laid down are crucial to the commercial viability and success of the programme.
A considerable delay is building up in relation to Galileo, in terms of the 2005 forecasts.
The tender procedure has been extended, and that is going to have serious repercussions for the programming of the project as a whole.
That too is why our question is relevant.
We must ensure the continuity of the project and seek the most creative and appropriate solutions in the light of the programme's objectives.
We would urge the Commission to continue with its negotiating efforts and ensure that there are going to be no further delays, so that Galileo, the largest of the European-scale industrial projects, moves forward under the best possible conditions and can play its appropriate role in the achievement of the Lisbon objectives.
We would also ask that the Commission carry out the reforms necessary also to promote the participation of SMEs.
In order to support Galileo, Parliament needs to be kept informed.
The commitment is there and you have mentioned it.
We must also be informed of the costs and consequences of the delay.
I agree that it will be useful for Parliament to monitor the project periodically.
To that end, it is important that the supervisory authority, which you have mentioned, also send its reports to Parliament and that the expert appointed by Parliament has the status of observer in the authorityâs activities.
In fact, this Parliament has previously expressed its full support for the Galileo programme, taking on legislative and budgetary commitments and clearly acknowledging that Galileo is a strategic project, one of the pillars of the Lisbon Strategy, which in turn offers great opportunities to our small and medium-sized businesses.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, you know, I would be happy to continue this discussion all night, because Galileo is a really exciting project.
Even so, I should like once again to reassure the honourable Members: the first of the two experimental satellites was launched from BaÃ¯konour on 28Â December 2005, and it has successfully transmitted all of the signals allowing us to guarantee the use of the frequency bands allocated to the European satellite navigation system.
The second satellite, GIOVE-B, will be launched in the course of 2007.
It will carry other technologically advanced equipment such as the passive hydrogen MASER atomic clock, which will be the most precise atomic clock ever launched into space.
In parallel with this, the industrial activities of the in-orbit validation phase began in December 2004.
I have already said, and I will say it again, that the entire contract for the validation phase, amounting to EURÂ 1Â 038Â million, was signed on 19Â January 2006.
We are now entering a new phase, which will involve investigating all the possible applications for Galileo.
As I have explained, we have issued a kind of appeal to all small and medium-sized enterprises and engineers able to develop innovations in this field.
The Green Paper will in fact aim to ask the right questions, which should enable us to reach a better understanding of all the possible applications.
Next, when this has given us an overall vision of the applications, we will be better able to deal with the public/private partnership and to plan how to distribute efforts.
The industrial sector also needs to be involved, to the extent that it can benefit from these applications.
That will finally allow us to found this concession contract on a reasonable financial basis.
There is no reason to think, at this stage, that we will find ourselves in a situation difficult enough to upset the balance of the project.
That being said, I have made a genuine commitment to keeping Parliament informed â MrsÂ Barsi-Pataky, as rapporteur, is well aware of this, and I should like to thank her once again.
I am absolutely committed to coming to Parliament whenever necessary to explain how things stand and how they are developing.
You suggested that Parliament should have observer status; we have already explained our position in this regard to the competent committees.
It would be difficult for Parliament to try to be an observer at the same time as performing all of its monitoring activities.
In any event, however, MrÂ President, I should like to reiterate this evening the commitment I have made: I will keep Parliament fully informed of everything that happens, both of the implementation of the concession contract and the public/private partnership and of how we are going to manage the contributions of third countries and their participation in Galileo.
Â Â  I am much obliged to Commission Vice-PresidentÂ Barrot.
To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution(1) has been tabled under RuleÂ 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on freedom, security and justice, as well as immigration, all of which are extremely topical issues, particularly following the repercussions of the meetings held this weekend in Tampere.
These are:
- the oral question to the Council on the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty), by Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (O-0086/2006 B6-0428/2006), and
- the Council and Commission statements on the common immigration policy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, MrÂ Frattini, fellow Members, before replying to the oral question, allow me briefly to thank you publicly, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, for organising the Tampere ministerial meeting, which took place in really excellent conditions.
As Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I very much want clearly to express how keenly the European Parliament supports the Presidencyâs and the Commissionâs proposal to activate the bridging clause provided for by ArticleÂ 42 of the Treaty.
This bridging clause was, I repeat, devised at the very time when the European Union was entrusted with the task of facilitating cooperation between the Member States on security matters, that is to say at the time when the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht was drawn up.
The clause did not include a deadline by which it had to be activated.
Broadly speaking, it is enough for there to be a combination of mutual confidence and the right political conditions in order for this decision to be taken.
Oddly enough, this bridging clause has never so far been activated because transfer to the ordinary legislative procedure was determined directly by the Treaty of Amsterdam when it came to asylum and immigration policies and to judicial cooperation on civil matters and then by the Treaty of Nice, which facilitated transfer to the codecision procedure in the case of these policies that had been communitised.
Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters has, however, remained excluded from the scope of such communitisation.
On that basis, the question arises as to whether, 14 years after the Treaty of Maastricht, the political conditions â in the form of mutual confidence â have finally come together, enabling the Member States to agree to apply the normal decision-making procedure provided for since Maastricht to this highly sensitive field of cooperation.
For the European Parliament, the answer is clearly in the affirmative, and for three reasons.
Activation of the bridging clause would, firstly, enable the democratic deficit to be reduced; secondly, strengthen the rule of law; and, finally, make for more effective decision-making.
Let us quickly consider these three points.
Where the democratic deficit is concerned, I think it crucial to strengthen the democratic principle whereby all EU legislation, especially when it affects the rights and freedoms of the individual, must be adopted in association with the representatives of the people.
There is a serious deficit when that does not happen.
To defenders of the status quo, who claim that this democratic principle is not absent from the third pillar because governments supposedly act under the supervision of their national parliaments, I should like to offer the following clear response. Can anyone sincerely maintain that national parliamentary supervision is sufficient to ensure democratic balance when decisions are adopted at EU, rather than national, level?
What, moreover, is one to make of cases in which this parliamentary supervision is absent, as will be the case when it comes to renegotiating the agreements with the United States concerning, in particular, the Passenger Name Records (PNR) agreement â an extremely serious issue that will be considered outside the framework of any democratic control.
Let us turn now to the second reason, which has to do with the principle of strengthening the rule of law.
According to this principle, it must be possible for a judge to verify the legality of legislation of any kind.
Where EU legislation is concerned, the judge in question should, logically, sit in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
However, ArticleÂ 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and ArticleÂ 35 of the Treaty on European Union introduce such limitations on the competence of that jurisdiction that the judges themselves have expressed doubts as to whether certain legislation relating to the second and third pillars respects the principle of the rule of law.
This issue therefore needs to be resolved.
Let us finally turn to the third point, which is about effective decision-making.
As we all know, the need to maintain unanimity prevents rapid and effective decision-making of any kind, and this at a time when the seriousness of the threats to the EU since the attacks of 11Â September and those on Madrid and London should encourage a much more rapid decision-making process.
Having noted these three weaknesses - and they are, moreover, difficult to challenge objectively â how is it possible still to justify postponing a decision that could have been taken as long as about ten years ago?
Some claim, MrÂ President, that this issue should be settled within the framework of negotiations for a new Constitutional Treaty.
That is something to hope for, but can we afford to await the outcome of this whole process, which will, at the very least, take two to three years when there are ongoing security threats and a permanent question mark over our freedoms?
Admittedly, the bridging clause will require ratification by the national parliaments, and that could enable those who are more hesitant to gain a bit of time.
This difficulty may, however, be overcome through more thorough dialogue with the national parliaments, which, moreover, we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs will be receiving on 3 and 4Â October 2006, that is to say next week, in the form of a big interparliamentary meeting at which we have high hopes of convincing them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I bring greetings from Tampere and my colleague Leena Luhtanen.
I would first like to thank MrÂ Cavada and MrÂ Gargani for their enormous contribution at Tampere.
We had open and concrete discussions about the development of freedom, security and justice.
In connection with this, while we were there we also learnt about cycling, and Commissioner Frattini said that we have to keep pedalling so we do not fall over.
It is somewhat similar with the European Union.
Some of my more critical colleagues said that surely the bicycle can be stopped safely, and you can even put your feet on the ground to support yourself.
I finally had to say that if the chain has come off, however, it is difficult to get going again.
We should perhaps adopt the philosophy that MrÂ Cavada seems to espouse in what was an excellent speech.
Cooperation in the European Union is important for strengthening the security of our citizens, and at the same time we need to ensure that basic rights and freedoms are observed.
In this connection, the European Unionâs ability to function, take speedy decisions and respond to changes in the operating environment is decisive.
The policy line taken at the European Council in Tampere in 1999 means that there have to continue to be high levels of cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council.
The Finnish Presidency wants to promote the new Tampere spirit.
The protection of fundamental rights is a priority.
All the Member States are parties to the European Convention on Human Rights, and the work of the Council constantly reflects the importance of guaranteeing that the principles contained in it are upheld.
This also obviously applies to such sensitive issues as combating terrorism.
I would emphasise that these values are acknowledged in all areas, both in internal action and in relations with third countries.
Particular attention is being paid to establishing a European Fundamental Rights Agency.
Discussions on a Council Regulation establishing the proposed Fundamental Rights Agency of the European Union have begun, and the work has now reached an important phase.
The Finnish Presidency will be making a determined effort to have this agency set up by the beginning of next year.
An important question that was raised is whether the Agency should also act in areas now covered under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
The Presidency particularly wants to focus on exploring the Agencyâs competences under the third pillar.
To this end, we hope that the Member States will demonstrate flexibility, so that we might find a solution that satisfies everyone.
Last autumn, we had constructive talks on the Data Retention Directive, in what was a difficult situation, to look at its technical, legal and financial aspects.
We were soon in a position to address the main concerns of the Member States and the European Parliament.
I think that this is a splendid example of how decisions can be taken by a qualified majority, but at the same time the aim is to reach a consensus.
Thus encouraged, we would like to adopt the Framework Decision on the protection of personal data under the third pillar as quickly as possible.
We aim to conclude the first reading of the proposal during the current six-month term.
The Council is now carefully considering the European Parliamentâs opinion on this proposal.
The abolition of checks at internal borders â that is, the expansion of the Schengen area â is an important political objective for creating an area in the European Union based on freedom.
The Schengen evaluation process launched at the beginning of this year has already made it possible to carry out comprehensive evaluations of police and visa cooperation in the new Member States, as well as data protection at land and sea borders and at airports.
The new Member States must meet all the conditions for applying the Schengen .
This also implies the existence of a viable Schengen Information System.
The inspections arranged for this year are now well underway.
We will be reviewing the results in December and then deciding on further measures.
Some time ago, we received a report from the Commission concerning the delayed technical progress of the SIS II system.
Measures and timetables relating to this must be examined openly and honestly in the light of the latest information.
European Council policy means that we have an obligation and a desire to examine what we might be able to do to accelerate preparations for abolishing checks at internal borders.
The Finnish Presidency has promoted the drafting of the legislation on SIS II together with the European Parliament, and hopefully we will reach consensus on this in October.
I would like to thank Parliamentâs rapporteur, MrÂ Coelho, for his tough but resolute approach to finding a joint solution.
In a high-level working group in the Council, we also agreed on practical measures to try and improve coordination of the SIS II project and cooperation between national projects and preparations for the central system, which is the responsibility of the Commission.
The Finnish Presidency of the Council raised this controversial matter immediately in July, and it was also discussed last week at Tampere.
At next weekâs Council meeting, we will be discussing the new technical preparations timetable for the SIS II project and any realistic alternative solutions that we might have at our disposal.
This should lay the groundwork for setting a target date for removing internal border controls at the December Council and in the European Council.
At the December Council, the overall situation with regard to the Schengen inspections may also be examined.
We will do our utmost to expand the Schengen area as quickly as possible, with no compromises on security.
The Treaty already contains provisions on procedures to help assess interpretations of cases under Title IV of the Treaty or the legality or interpretation of acts adopted by the Communityâs institutions.
Under ArticleÂ 67 of the Treaty, the Council, acting unanimously and having consulted the European Parliament, may adapt the provisions relating to the competence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
This Friday the matter will be raised for the first time by the Court of Justice working party, and whether or not it will be discussed further will depend on the opinions expressed by the Member States there.
The Presidency regards this as an important issue.
As we know, the citizens of the EU quite rightly expect the European Union to be able to engage in more effective cooperation in the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
At the same time, we have to ensure that fundamental rights and freedoms are respected.
By virtue of the Treaty on European Union, the Council, acting unanimously and having consulted the European Parliament, may adopt the use of the bridging clause provided for in ArticleÂ 42 TEU, and âcommunitariseâ police cooperation and cooperation on crime either entirely or partially.
Last week in Tampere, an important debate was held on this subject between representatives of the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament, and I particularly want to draw attention to the view firmly expressed there by MrÂ Cavada in the Council of Ministers, which reflects not only my own opinion but that of the European Parliament too.
It was a very important addition to our debate.
There was also huge support there for more effective decision-making.
We are determined to continue the work in this area in accordance with the European Councilâs conclusions.
I wish to stress that this debate does not go against the Constitutional Treaty: we want to emphasise specifically the importance of the Treaty in the development of an area based on freedom, security and justice.
In order for progress in legal and internal matters to be visible in public security as well, we need to ensure that these acts are fully integrated into the legal systems of the Member States.
During our presidential term, we will aim to develop systems to evaluate legal and internal matters, on the basis of the Commissionâs communication.
In addition, several peer evaluation methods have been established for matters connected with organised crime and terrorism.
Not all the Member States have yet ratified the Protocols to the Europol Convention.
The Council has regularly reminded Member States of the importance of this matter.
Finland trusts that the Protocol will enter into force by the end of the current year.
Closer cooperation between law enforcement authorities has been one way of trying to achieve added value in internal security in the enlarged Union.
The Presidency can announce that Finland will adopt actions nationally in the near future that will permit it to become a signatory to the PrÃŒm Treaty.
Soon at least eight Member States will have signed up to this Treaty.
This fulfils the minimum requirement for initiating enhanced cooperation pursuant to ArticleÂ 43 of the Treaty on European Union.
As the country to hold the Presidency, we will work towards making the PrÃŒm Treaty part of the European Unionâs legal system.
The Council will continue its discussion on the Framework Decision on procedural rights on the basis of the Commissionâs initiative.
In June, the Council decided to continue its work on the basis of the compromise proposal put forward by the Presidency.
This imposed greater restrictions on the number and scope of rights than did the joint proposal, focusing instead on general requirements.
We are likewise aiming to bring to a conclusion the first reading of the proposal as regards its main content during the current six-month term.
Regarding racism and xenophobia, the Council has been advised that the Member States that had had general reservations about the draft instrument no longer have them.
Talks can therefore start again as soon as possible.
The European Union has developed a joint policy on immigration, border control and asylum on the basis of the Tampere European Council and the Hague Programme.
It is founded on the solidarity of the Member States, mutual trust and shared responsibility.
It takes full account of human and fundamental rights, including the Geneva Convention on Refugees and the right to seek asylum in the European Union.
Member States and their authoritative bodies are responsible for controlling their external borders and immigration and carrying out asylum-seeking procedures.
During the Finnish Presidency so far, the Council has aimed to have a comprehensive debate on immigration questions.
This was the case both at the July Council and at the informal ministerial meeting in Tampere last week.
Recent events in the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean highlight the destiny that the countries of Europe share and the need for commitment on the part of all the Member States.
It is essential that the Unionâs institutions â the European Parliament, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), the Commission, and other competent bodies â act in a spirit of cooperation and coordination.
The European Union needs to step up its efforts to give practical support to Member States that bear the greatest burden when it comes to the number of illegal immigrants arriving.
In connection with this, the Presidency presented its initiative on extended European solidarity at the meeting in Tampere.
Under the initiative, in return for a financial contribution from the EU, procedures would be put in place to ensure that Member States adhere to jointly agreed rules and take responsibility for illegal immigrants and asylum seekers entering their territory.
The debate on the Presidentâs initiative is to continue, on the basis of the very positive discussions at Tampere.
Development aid from the European Union and the Member States is crucial to eliminating the reasons for illegal migration.
The crisis in the Mediterranean now at last shows us how important external relations are in the fight against illegal migration.
The Global Approach to Migration and the principal measures focusing on Africa and the Mediterranean region, adopted by the European Council last December, provide a common framework within which the EU can act.
This will strengthen cooperation between the Member States and increase dialogue with the countries of Africa and cooperation in the Mediterranean region as a whole.
The European Council has asked the Commission to report back on the progress made by the end of this year.
A number of important initiatives have come out of the Global Approach. These include the ministerial meeting in Rabat in July, the initiatives by Frontex to develop Mediterranean coastal surveillance, and special operations to help Spain and Malta.
The Presidency is promoting these initiatives, as well as the very important Commission proposal for a Regulation for establishing Rapid Border Intervention Teams (the âRabitâ Regulation).
One of the Finnish Presidencyâs main priorities is to develop a system for the integrated control of external borders and the adoption of a strategy on this.
Furthermore, the Commission will be examining the relevant questions in the communication on illegal immigration presented in July coherently and thoroughly.
In order to fulfil the aims on illegal immigration set out at Tampere, a number of acts have already been passed which apply to the status of people long resident in a country, family reunification, granting residence permits to the victims of human trafficking, and admission for the purposes of study, vocational training, voluntary work and scientific research.
Last January, the Commission adopted a policy plan on legal immigration in accordance with the mandate in the Hague Programme. This also takes account of the Lisbon Programme adopted in July last year.
Another major step forward is the framework programme on solidarity and management of migration flows for the period 2007-2013 and the four funds to be established under it: the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund, the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals.
The Council is working towards an agreement at first reading with the European Parliament on these important instruments.
The Presidency realises that the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning third country nationals who are illegally resident is very important for a common repatriation policy, but we are also aware of the issues that have to be resolved in order to reach a compromise on the proposals within a reasonable period of time.
In partnership with the European Parliament and the Commission, the Council has already decided to intensify the debate to bring deliberations on the proposal to a conclusion.
On the matter of asylum, a discussion on how current EU asylum rules might be improved is expected to be launched.
The Commission is to draft a Green Paper on the future of the common European asylum system.
This was also discussed at Tampere.
It is the goal of the Presidency to ensure that the current minimum standards are transformed into genuine common rules on asylum and subsidiary protection.
Practical cooperation between Member States on asylum issues also needs to be reinforced.
The Council is expecting the Commission to put forward its proposal on this matter.
The Council is also expecting the Commission to put forward a legislative proposal in the near future with regard to extending long-term residential status to refugees and to those who have gained subsidiary protection status.
Increased transparency in the work of the Union is a key aim.
In June, the European Council agreed on measures to enhance transparency.
The Finnish Presidency stresses the vital importance of transparency, and proposes actively to take forward the debate on transparency on the basis of the Green Paper.
The transparency banner was also waved vigorously at Tampere.
Finally, with regard to the secret detention facilities mentioned in a speech by the President of the United States of America in early September, I wish to reassure Parliament that the Council is aware of the possible implications.
At a sitting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in September, ministers expressed their commitment to combating terrorism effectively using all the legal means and tools available to them.
Terrorism is simply a threat to a system of values based on the rule of law.
Human rights and humanitarian standards have to be adhered to in the fight against terrorism.
As I said at a meeting in August in London, not one victory must go to terrorism or to their efforts to undermine our fundamental rights and values.
At the JHA Council in July, I said that I thought it was essential that the Member States should also encourage a report on CIA flights carrying prisoners to be produced, in order to strengthen the basis of more confidential and viable cooperation on security.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry that my speech has gone on for so long, but I have been involved in parliamentary work for 24 years now.
When you get a chance to speak to such an agreeable gathering, you can feel like saying a bit too much, but I would like to say in conclusion that our citizens expect the European Union to deliver security, more effective decision-making and the ability to respond to new challenges as a matter of course.
They will also insist that we should be able to fight organised crime and terrorism and control migration flows and our common external borders effectively.
It is our responsibility and a challenge to parliamentary competence, both in the European Parliament and the national parliaments, to respond together to the demand being made of Europe that it should be a fair and safe place for everyone to live.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki.
The Council and the Commission have no time limit.
They can therefore take the opportunity to speak for as long as they need or see fit, but there are still only twenty-four hours in the day.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my profound satisfaction at the excellent cooperation with the Finnish Presidency, in particular, Mr RajamÃ€ki and Mrs Luhtanen, and with the European Parliament, particularly with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and Mr Cavada.
Implementing and further developing The Hague Programme is a joint goal. This calls for effective decision-making and requires clear political priorities to make a real difference.
The strategic political goal remains striking the right balance between improving citizensâ security and promoting and defending peopleâs individual rights.
As you know, last week in Tampere, we discussed the main challenges in the area of freedom, security and justice and how best to address them.
It is clear that the fight against terrorism and the management of migration flows are currently the main priorities for the European Union.
As I stressed in Tampere, I consider that our efforts in the fight against terrorism at European level need to focus on key areas such as fighting radicalisation and recruitment, the misuse of the internet by terrorists, the prevention and detection of the misuse of explosives, the protection of critical infrastructures, bio-preparedness and transport security.
I am also convinced that any new security measure, especially in relation to air transport, should not bring about a disproportionate reaction which, in my view, would hand victory to terrorism.
Security is at the centre of my action and we will assess carefully the effect and proportionality of any decision taken in that field.
The fight against terrorism and the defence of individual rights should go hand in hand.
As regards migration, the Commission decided to set up a Commissionersâ Group on Migration Issues.
I have the privilege of coordinating that group, which brings together all the policy areas relevant to migration management: from justice and home affairs to development, employment, education and training, regional policy, economic issues, external relations and European neighbourhood policy.
That comprehensive approach involves legal and illegal immigration, as well as integration.
Solidarity, in the form of financial support and the deployment of experts and equipment to our shared borders, is also an essential element of this approach.
While the focus is clearly on migration from Africa, such an approach has to take into account migratory movement from other regions of the world, particularly from our eastern neighbours, some of the countries from which many kinds of illegal trafficking originate.
In the field of illegal immigration, we have, as you know, recently taken many practical measures, particularly in relation to migration flows affecting southern Member States of the European Union.
Frontex, in particular, has been very active in coordinating assistance to the Member States in question, for example the Canary Islands, and further operations are planned in the short term in the central Mediterranean area.
Solidarity means practical help to Member States under pressure.
We need funds, equipment, boats, helicopters and aeroplanes.
For example, for the period 2007-2013, the Frontex Agency will have EURÂ 272 million, which I deem insufficient to deal with the growing phenomenon of migration.
Next year the agencyâs budget will be some EUR 21 million.
I hope that Parliament will agree to a further increase in the financial envelope.
Additional financial support has been provided to the Member States most affected, in particular Spain, Malta and Italy, via the ARGO programme.
In that regard, I should like to mention that last week the Commission decided to fund six emergency projects in the above countries.
The Commission has also adopted a package of measures to help Mauritania in its efforts to contain the flow of illegal migrants to the Canary Islands under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism.
We shall do the same concerning other important partners in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Senegal.
As regards the management of the southern external maritime border, I presented to the informal Tampere Council a set of recommendations for operational measures to be taken in the short term, that is, before the summer of 2007.
Those recommendations include: firstly, the setting-up of an operational command centre in the relevant regions to coordinate a Mediterranean coastal patrol network; secondly, exploring the establishment of a European surveillance system in order to link up the existing national surveillance systems; thirdly, making the pooling of assets a reality with equipment made available by all Member States to be put at the disposal, at short notice, of a Member State requesting assistance; fourthly, exploring options for the creation of a team of asylum experts in close cooperation with international organisations, above all the United Nations; fifthly, making the maximum and best use of current and future financial instruments.
The above measures aim to strengthen the Communityâs capacity to manage and prevent the kind of situations we have seen this year, and should be taken in parallel with the implementation of the global approach on migration adopted by the European Council last December.
It is a matter of ensuring an immediate political response based on tangible European solidarity â and I stress the word âtangibleâ â and a sharing of responsibilities and burdens.
That means, as recently stressed by President Barroso and by myself at Tampere, it is of the utmost importance that all Member States continue working together in a spirit of solidarity, not least to assist those southern Member States most affected today by illegal immigration from Africa.
It must be absolutely clear that it is up to Member States to provide the assets required to make the joint operations a success.
We have made a start, but just a start.
The size of the problem, however, is such that much more work is needed.
In that regard, I also hope that from next spring the European Union can make use of the Rapid Border Intervention Teams, whereby teams of national experts, under the coordination of Frontex, will provide quick technical and operational assistance to Member States in need.
Addressing migration in a comprehensive manner also entails developing a structural approach and reinforcing the inclusion of migration in European external policies.
This includes looking at the root causes of migration and development issues.
The Commission is making serious efforts to make migration an integral part of its development policy and is engaging in particular with African countries on this matter.
In particular, we must give priority to the implementation of the action plan agreed in Rabat last July and to the preparation of a successful European-African conference on migration with the African Union.
It is hoped that it will take place in November in Tripoli, Libya.
We should also strengthen our cooperation with North African countries, in particular Algeria, Morocco and Libya, on migration issues, including the issue of international protection, which necessitates a regional response.
In this regard, both EU Member States and North African countries must take responsibility for those in need of international protection, including asylum seekers.
Refugee protection is another important part of my portfolio and I am happy to announce to you that two specific regional programmes will start in the coming weeks.
We should also ensure that illegal migrants are returned to their countries.
In this respect, the Commission is ready to support the efforts of Member States politically, diplomatically and financially, while fully respecting peopleâs individual dignity.
We should also not forget another important element in fighting illegal immigration: the need to step up the fight against illegal work.
It is a key pull factor for illegal immigration.
As mentioned in Julyâs Commission communication on illegal migration, we are currently considering drafting a legislative instrument to harmonise sanctions against employers of illegally resident migrants.
Obviously, Member States would have to take immediate measures in this direction, so as to address the issue of illegal work.
In relation to legal economic migration, I must emphasise that the implementation of the Policy Plan on Legal Migration is a priority for the Commission and for me personally.
By eliminating illegal work and creating admission procedures for legal migrants, Europe will set up a virtuous circle, or, should I say, a positive structure of incentives.
The Commission is convinced of the necessity of a common approach to managing economic migration as an additional means of achieving the Lisbon objectives and tackling the negative effects of demographic ageing, in order to foster the European economy and competitiveness.
In particular, to contribute to economic growth, it is fundamental that Europe becomes, first and foremost, a real pole of attraction for highly skilled migrants.
The idea of proposing a directive on the conditions for admission to the European Union for highly skilled workers, including the possibility of a European green card, responds to this economic necessity.
Europe continues to receive low-skilled or unskilled labour only, while the United States, Canada and Australia, for example, are able to attract talented migrants.
However, at the same time, I think proper measures should be taken to avoid the growing risk of a brain-drain from poorer countries.
A proposal for a directive on the rights of legal migrants in employment constitutes the other pillar of the Commissionâs policy in this field for the next year.
Both proposals will be presented in the second half of 2007, under the Portuguese Presidency.
Last but not least, I should like to stress another important element of European immigration policy: the integration of migrants.
As highlighted in the Common Agenda for Integration, which I put forward in September 2005, greater integration efforts are crucial for a successful common European immigration policy.
I strongly hope that after the Council in Luxembourg has endorsed this global European approach towards migration, the same European common approach will also be approved at the highest political level by the European Council in Lahti.
Let me now turn to the â clauseâ.
In Tampere, as Minister RajamÃ€ki and Mr Cavada have just said, we also discussed how to improve decision-making in the field of security and justice, in particular by using the ââ or âbridging clauseâ.
As you know, the Commissionâs position has always been very close to Parliamentâs on this issue, as we consider that the bridging clause represents an appropriate and important tool for the Union and Member States to ensure greater efficiency, transparency and accountability of the decision-making process in addition to greater democratic legitimacy, given the stronger role of Parliament.
The debate in Tampere has been very open and constructive.
All the Member States, even those that are still reluctant, agreed on the need to move forward.
While some of them expressed fears that a decision now on the âclauseâ would pre-empt the debate on relaunching the constitutional process, I believe this is not the case.
We will be among the first to welcome a positive outcome of the exploration the German Presidency intends to carry out in 2007 and we will give them our full support.
Nevertheless, we have to prepare ourselves for a situation where the âpasserelleâ clause may be the only way to address the urgent need that all of us share.
I agree that we need the Constitution, but if we wait we may find ourselves paralysed.
In any case, as you know, when the Constitution comes into force the âpasserelleâ clause will be incorporated into it automatically.
I agreed with Minister RajamÃ€ki when he said in Tampere that Europe is like a bicycle: either it goes ahead or it falls to the ground.
And it was only by going ahead faster than others that my compatriot Bettini won the Cycling World Championship a few days ago.
We must, therefore, continue this very important political discussion, building upon the common goodwill shown by all Member States in Tampere.
At the next Justice and Home Affairs Council, which takes place in a few days in Luxembourg, we will have a chance to decide on how to move this important dossier forward.
Finally, citizens do want more Europe.
Europe would then be more effective in taking decisions.
Practitioners, judges, prosecutors and police authorities also want more effective instruments to fight organised crime and terrorism.
To be frank, we cannot allow civil society to move faster than our political strategies and policies.
If we want to be credible, we have to respond now and not only after tragic events, as has happened in the past.
Â Â  We thank the Vice-President of the Commission for his explanation of what happened in Tampere and for his optimistic view of what took place there.
We shall now hear the opinions of the political groups.
Please bear in mind that the Membersâ speaking time is restricted.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the management of migratory flows, and hence the control of immigration into the EU, is among the most pressing problems with which we have to deal, and it goes without saying that doing so involves looking beyond our narrow national horizons, but that does not mean that we can limit ourselves to a European analysis or to European approaches either.
Cooperation with transit countries and countries of origin, and support given to them, are part of the solution, but what is also needed is an integrated approach, for immigration needs to be regulated, and that cannot be a matter for internal policy alone; solutions can be found only by joint efforts across various policy areas.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has for a long time been calling for immigration policy that takes account of the needs and rights of other Member States.
For example, one cannot go ahead with a mass legalisation without informing or consulting others, only to seek help from the EU once that action begins to suck other migrants in.
It is fundamental that national immigration policy must bear in mind its effects on other Member States.
It has to be said, though, that making a policy area â in this case, that of immigration â part of Community policy-making, which involves making it subject to codecision, is not a panacea.
There are certainly many problems that affect us all, but at least an equal number that are specifically national, regional or even local in character.
For many, one of the attractions of a Community policy on economic migration is that it not only extends their own powers, but could also help with the enforcement of an immigration policy for which there was no majority support at national level, but that motivation takes no account of the Member Statesâ right to adequate solutions; no policy can succeed unless the citizens of our Member States have a hand in framing it.

Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we, in our group, have spent a great deal of time working out how we were going to approach todayâs debate.
The last time I took the floor of this House to speak in a debate on internal and security policy was when I spoke on the European arrest warrant and the plan for a European Public Prosecutorâs office, following which I had an enormous row with the President-in-Office of the Council.
I have no desire to repeat that experience today, but I have to tell the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that I am not going to mince my words either.
Looking around the Chamber, I can see MrÂ Kirkhope, MrÂ Pirker, MrsÂ Klamt, MrÂ Watson, MrsÂ Lambert and MrsÂ Roure; like me, all of them were sitting here six years ago, when we all said exactly the same things.
At the time, MrÂ Watson was the Committee chairman, and the Commissioner was a certain MrÂ Vitorino, who, by way of a follow-up to Tampere, presented us with what was called a scoreboard, which incorporated all the measures that you, Mr President-in-Office, and you, Commissioner, have described.
The scoreboard owed its name to the fact that it explicitly specified timeframes, with measure A to be transposed by the Member States within period B, and the Commissionâs report to reach the Council within period C, and so on.
Why, then, six years on, are we again sitting in this House discussing the same issues, the passerelle clause, for example?
Six years ago, we were full of optimism when we discussed the provision in the Treaty of Nice to the effect that, from 1999 onwards, and entering into effect five years later â that is, in 2004 â and subject to a unanimous vote in Council, the policy areas that we are discussing today should become subject to the codecision procedure, yet, two years later, nothing has happened yet.
Mrs Klamt made an important point when she said that we must not, where integration or the processing of asylum applications are concerned, interfere with the powers of national, local and regional authorities, but nor can we tolerate a situation in which Community rules and regulations are indispensable yet not forthcoming.
The streams of migrants reaching Europeâs southern coasts, which we are discussing today, will not be managed by restrictive measures alone; they call for an approach combining measures against organised crime, measures to give immigrants legal status and a coordinated policy of integration.
That is not news to any of us.
Why, then, are the Member States refusing to implement the proposals that Commissioner Frattini has just described?
I think I know the answer to that question.
The reason why they are refusing to do it is that these policy areas â the security of external borders, asylum, the law on citizenship, freedom of establishment and movement, police and justice policy â give them an opportunity to say to their citizens: âIt is we â not anyone else â who hold the reins of power in this state.â
For fifteen years, the states have shrunk back from the abrogation of sovereignty that the transfer of such rights to the European Union represents, and I can understand why they do, for it involves, to a degree, the surrender of national power, but this surrender of a bit of power must be weighed against the prospect of migration, people-trafficking, uncontrolled immigration and the problems associated with them being allowed to drag on even longer.
For ten years, the interior ministers of the European Union have failed to do anything about this, and this state of affairs must be brought to an end.
That is why the approach to which our question refers, and the answers we have been given today â particularly by Commissioner Frattini â are right, but it is time for action at long last.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Cavada for his oral question, the opportunity for this debate, and the excellent work that he and his colleagues do in their committee.
I had the honour to chair that committee at the time of the Council meeting in 1999 in Tampere.
I have observed the process from Tampere to Tampere. It has been seven lean years.
Rather like a critic once said of Samuel Beckettâs play : âIt is a two-act play in which nothing happens, twice.â
I salute the efforts of Commissioner Frattini and of the Finnish Presidency in trying to coax and cajole the Member States forward.
Mr RajamÃ€ki spoke of breathing new life into the spirit of Tampere.
It is desperately needed. But the fact is that the country I know best threw a spanner into the works when it insisted on having three pillars.
Other countries are now blocking the process of repair.
Unless we are able to bring in the footbridge â the â clauseâ â we will never have a credible policy in justice and home affairs.
We will continue with a policy like a push-bike when what we need is a Ducati.
Member States sit there in their medieval fastnesses with the drawbridges firmly up.
In the name of national sovereignty they are enhancing global anarchy.
Our citizens demand better.
In the early period of building the European Union, political leaders were ahead of public opinion.
They saw leadership as painting a vision of the Europe they wanted and leading people towards it.
That can be a dangerous strategy, but far less dangerous than being in the position â as you pointed out, Commissioner â of being behind public opinion.
Our citizens are asking: why is there no immigration policy to prevent the human tragedy we see on our southern shores?
Why are we not sharing criminal intelligence in the fight against terrorism or the fight against drugs?
Why is there no access to justice for victims of cross-border crime or cross-border marital breakdown?
When ministers meet, as Abba Eban once said in a different context, they ânever miss an opportunity to miss an opportunityâ.
We want to see more emphasis on European values.
We may have no constitution, but we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Mr RajamÃ€ki, you said that human rights are at the top of the Councilâs concerns and fully taken into account.
Are you sure?
What about the CIA secret prisons saga, where this House was right to set up a committee on rendition to see whether we need to use Article 7?
What about the PNR issue, where the 2007 agreement to replace the sticking-plaster solution you have devised this month must be in tandem with the framework decision on the protection of personal data?
And what about minimum procedural guarantees for suspects in criminal proceedings: why is that issue still at the bottom of the in-tray?
Of course there is some progress.
But too often the Union looks like the mime artist Marcel Marceau; he appears to be climbing a wall but actually he is going nowhere.
I want Mr Frattini and the Presidency to take to the Council on 6 October the message that Europe demands better.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been in favour of these topics becoming part of Community procedure ever since the Treaty of Maastricht invented the pillar system, which in theory was only meant to be temporary but in reality has proved to be fairly definitive.
Procedures are not everything, however, and I wonder what policy will now be implemented on these topics by Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The priority seems to be that of reducing, rejecting, constraining and eliminating, and it is curious to note that this debate began with the Commissioner speaking about terrorism and maintaining that security must be our top priority.
I believe that this speaks volumes, not least about what many of our leaders think constitutes a priority.
Despite the borders, the terrible risks, and the ever-increasing tolerance of violations of international law, we will not succeed in stopping immigration, and that has to be a point on which we are all quite clear.
Frankly, Commissioner, I do not like it when you overuse the word âsolidarityâ, especially when you mean âhelping the Member States to refuse entry at the borders to people who arrive in a desperate state, without any rightsâ.
I should also like to point out that, by adopting this approach, we have by no means eliminated the risk that, if we refuse entry at the borders to people arriving by boat, we will be seriously breaching the right of many of them to seek asylum, insofar as they are being sent straight back to the place from which they came.
Mass legalisations, which are condemned not only by MrsÂ Klamt, but also by MrÂ Frattini, are a direct result of the policy that says âzero immigration is possibleâ, but that actually hides a reality, namely that we need immigrants.
MrÂ Frattini, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, I do not know whether it is true that the majority of the illegal immigrants who come to our countries have no qualifications.
I know of cases of history teachers and electricians: qualified people who come here but who cannot find jobs for qualified workers, because they obviously become mixed up with people who have no qualifications whatsoever; in my opinion, saying that the problem is one of depriving developing countries of people who can, instead, help those countries to get out of their underdeveloped state is the wrong message for the European Union to be sending out.
Finally, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, MrÂ Frattini, I should like it if you could give your ideas on the topic of agreements with third countries.
My group and I are very concerned about this issue; we know that some of the Member States, such as France, Spain and Italy, are using understandings between police forces to secretly negotiate agreements with third countries that give no guarantees whatsoever regarding respect for peopleâs rights; we know full well that those countries very often deliberately violate the rights not only of their own citizens, but also of migrants.
This is particularly true of Libya, to which MrÂ Frattini has just stated his desire to donate a large sum of money.
Personally, I should like it if he were to spend a little time explaining what kind of democracy and publicity is required for agreements such as this one.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that, after the failure of last week's Informal Summit in Tampere, the decision has been taken not only to stop pedalling, but perhaps also to lean the bicycle against the wall.
Todayâs debate also shares this characteristic: the fight against terrorism, the CIA flights, PNR and police cooperation are all being mixed up with immigration.
Only when we realise that the topic of immigration must be dissociated from repressive policies, measures to criminalise migrants and the methods used to combat terrorism and organised crime will it then be possible to hold a serious debate on a common European Union policy on immigration.
We must also ban from our debate any talk of an invasion: the label 'invasion' is untrue and unfounded; we all know that only 15% of illegal immigrants come by sea from Africa and that all the rest come by land or by air.
This is the case in Spain and Italy too, even allowing for the numbers of migrants who arrive in the Canary Islands or Lampedusa.
We need to start again using legal channels.
As the Commission Green Paper informed us: âWe need 20Â million immigrant workers by 2030.â
So let us take steps to let these people in, instead of leaving them to drown at sea.
We do not understand what Frontex did this summer to prevent people from dying.
Europe cannot become known for turning immigrants away , nor can we allow the Atlantic and the Mediterranean to become open-air cemeteries.
I have a proposal to make to MrÂ Frattini: let us build a monument, an eternal reminder of the migrants drowned at sea.
In a few monthsâ time, it will be the 10th anniversary of the first recognised drowning of migrants at sea, when a boat carrying almost 400 emigrants sank off Porto Palo, between Malta and Sicily.
Let us make a humanitarian gesture!
Let us build a monument, a symbolic collective tomb for the unknown men and women who died at sea because they were seeking a better future.
As a great Roman poet might have said, âlet us build a collective monument more lasting than bronzeâ.
When it comes to holding a serious debate on immigration, this is probably the most powerful, most practical gesture that Europe can now make.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already taken the floor on many occasions in this House in order to stress the urgent need for a common immigration policy, and I am pleased to note the recent initiatives undertaken at Community level and the recent release of funds intended for crisis-hit countries.
The gradual realisation on the part of the Member States â which are now convinced, albeit belatedly perhaps, of the countless tragic deaths in the Mediterranean â that migration no longer just affects the States on the edge of the EU and that the general objectives of economic growth can only be achieved within a general climate of security is anything but trivial.
This realisation may at last persuade them to take an equal share in the responsibility and financial burden of managing our borders.
This is a real commitment, and it is also demonstrated by the increased financial resources that the EU will make available over the next seven years for the purposes of consolidating an area of freedom, security and justice.
Another positive aspect is the creation of a specific programme aimed at controlling migratory flows with funds intended for repatriations, refugees and integration.
Equally important is the creation of a border management agency, which unfortunately still does not have enough staff, but I hope that it will gradually benefit from more attention and funds.
I hope that, by taking this step, we will be able to create common minimum standards for combating illegal immigration and controlling legal immigration and that we will be able to draft a credible policy that respects the rights of individuals.
However, a credible policy can only be rigorous; there is no place for a European policy that promotes mass legalisations and that indiscriminately hands out citizenship rights.
It is widely known these days not only that legalisations do not allow problems to be resolved without immigrants' circumstances being improved, but that they nearly always exacerbate them instead, merely encouraging marginalisation and widespread crime, which often result in terrorism.
Finally, being credible means reaffirming the ideals of solidarity and of safeguarding the EUâs own freedoms, and tying this to respect for the law.
The EU will never refuse to help the needy and those who genuinely want to integrate, but when it comes to those who want to export violence, culture, values and religions, the 'zero tolerance' principle must take effect; we may not like it, but sometimes it is crucial.
Â Â  . Mr President, last weekâs informal summit in Tampere made one thing clear: the Member States fundamentally disagree on how to tackle illegal immigration.
Everyone can see that a solution is needed, but opinions differ on how this should be done.
That is why the immigration issue is something that Member States are keen to consign to the European negotiation tables, and that is how history gets to repeat itself.
In the late 1990s, the Netherlands and Germany, facing major problems with the influx of asylum seekers, insisted on solidarity and a distribution of the burden.
France, Spain and Portugal, however, obstructed every solution at European level, while northern Member States now fail to react to requests for help.
It is at the European level, though, that the solution must be found.
A common market with a shared space in which citizens can move freely requires consistent security of its external borders and regulated access to that space.
European policy for illegal immigration is necessary, provided that countries stop acting independently.
If the Spanish authorities can give 700Â 000 illegal immigrants an amnesty without consulting other Member States, then Spain cannot expect help from other Member States.
Finally, President Bush has acknowledged the existence of secret CIA prisons.
To this day, though, it is unclear in which countries these prisons were situated, and whether any of them were in the European Union.
I should like to hear from the Council and Commission what they intend to do in order to dispel this uncertainty.
Â Â  MrÂ President, by regularising the status of one and a half million illegal immigrants in 2005, Spain and Italy have provoked a huge influx of people from Africa, the continent nearest to Western Europe and something of a suburb of Paris.
Spain, rightly accused of irresponsibility in regularising the status of illegal immigrants, argues in response that the majority of Africans arriving in the Canaries â 25Â 000 since the beginning of the year â are French speakers whose intention it is to travel on to other countries.
That being the case, one can appreciate why the truly disastrous Schengen agreement, applied since 1985, needs to be repealed, as it enables any illegal immigrants arriving in Spain, Italy or elsewhere, their status newly regularised, to enter France and benefit from all the social benefits provided there.
Having missed eight of the last ten Council meetings for ministers of the interior, MrÂ Sarkozy is in no real position to criticise Spain, and this at a time when France is in favour of abolishing the requirement of unanimity in judicial and police cooperation, that is to say is in favour of abandoning one of its sovereign powers.
It is crucial to be able to monitor our own borders at a time when immigration is a worldwide phenomenon.
The task of monitoring thousands of kilometres of eminently porous coastline or land borders cannot be entrusted to others, and the Member Statesâ shortcomings in this regard cannot be made up for by Frontex, this European setup that is supposed to monitor Europeâs borders.
Unless we deal with the problem of immigration at source and come up with a large-scale development policy, we shall continue to play host to millions of immigrants who, little by little, will destabilise the Europe we know and finally swamp it.
The European institutions are merely accelerating this downward spiral by favouring an immigration policy referred to hypocritically by MrÂ Sarkozy as âselective immigrationâ.
The nations of Europe should take charge of their own affairs again, as Switzerland has just done, and protect themselves against the migratory invasion that has only just begun.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating MrÂ Frattini on having quite rightly once again used a term that is crucial at this point in the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice: the term priorities.
In this regard, I would like to say that we need a great debate and a great result, which cannot be delayed at this point in the construction of the European Union, because we are often talking about concrete measures, but we need to define what is most important.
In one decade, what will be the final objective in terms of the competences of the European Union and the Member States with regard to the two issues that MrÂ Frattini has mentioned: immigration and radical Islamist terrorism?
That debate cannot be postponed, and, until it takes place and until we have a result, we will not be able to make the correct and appropriate progress in these areas.
It is a pre-constitutional debate.
It is undoubtedly the thing that creates the most fear today amongst Europeans in terms of their future.
It is therefore a pre-constitutional debate and therefore, MrÂ Frattini and representatives of the Council, it is something that cannot be postponed under any circumstances.
A European Union in one decade is impossible without an immigration policy.
It is impossible to conceive of a United States of America with as many immigration policies as it has States.
It is impossible to accept that with regard to an emerging phenomenon such as Islamic terrorism â which has dared to move on from placing bombs on a bus to placing bombs on a plane, from attacking cartoons to directly attacking the Pope, that is, an emerging phenomenon â the European Union and its institutions do not yet have a political role that the citizens can see.
It may be little, it may be enough or it may be a lot, but the serious problem is that the European citizens do not know what the European Union does, either in the field of immigration or in the field of terrorism.
This is therefore a debate that cannot be postponed.
This is the pre-constitutional debate yet to be held and it is the great debate that Europeans will hold over the coming months.
Â Â  MrÂ President, our debate is taking place soon after the Tampere II ministerial meeting, at which the Member States tackled issues fundamental to implementing a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice.
I am happy, then, that the issue of the bridging clause is finally up for discussion by the Council.
We are of, course, in favour of communitising the whole of the third pillar, particularly where legal immigration is concerned â a process that will finally help stop a number of Member States from blocking matters.
I would therefore ask the Council to continue with its discussions, which will, I hope, enable this bridging clause eventually to be activated.
I also wish to raise the issue of the agreement on transferring personal data in connection with flights, otherwise known as the Passenger Names Records (PNR) agreement.
Discussions with the US authorities are under way, but I understand that these authorities want still more.
Could Vice-President Frattini tell us whether these negotiations will lead to a common agreement before the end of the month, which is not far off?
We agreed on a two-stage procedure whereby the content would be discussed again in 2007.
Will the Americans really also be proceeding on that basis?
I should like, in this connection, to address a remark to the Council and point out that the European Parliament is now awaiting a firm commitment from the Council regarding the framework decision on data protection.
At the Tampere ministerial meeting, the Council appears to have gone back on the strong commitments on immigration made by the European Union seven years ago, particularly when it comes to putting in place a common immigration policy and common asylum system between now and 2010.
In this area, too, the deadline is close.
My group emphasises that better management of the external borders can only be one aspect of our common immigration policy.
No one can remain indifferent to the difficulties and the humanitarian crisis presented at our borders, particularly in southern Europe, or to the huge influx of migrants and asylum seekers.
We therefore want to see European solidarity strengthened.
We ask that Europe share the burdens and responsibilities of its immigration policy.
We also want to see partnerships implemented with the countries of origin and transit, based above all on respect for both fundamental rights and the right of asylum.
We must not, however, in any instance allow our borders to be controlled externally.
We want a comprehensive and transversal approach to immigration problems.
The fight against illegal immigration must be accompanied by practical proposals, whether they be in favour of opening legal immigration channels or of real and effective co-development.
We must fight against the underlying causes of migration in the shape of poverty and conflicts.
We must allow third countries in difficulties to develop, and migration must also be perceived as a positive factor for development, helping to reduce poverty.
We propose, for example, putting in place financial support for immigrants in their countries of origin.
To conclude, we want to see active exchange between countries of the North and those of the South and to be made aware of how the proposals in this area put forward in Rabat will be put into practice.
Â Â  Mr President, as the immigration problem is one of the biggest challenges to face us so far in 2006, one would think that all Member States would have been aware of the urgency of this problem by now, but nothing seems to be further from the truth.
The reports on last weekâs meeting in Tampere were enough to make one squirm.
Indecisiveness reigned supreme.
A truly humanitarian tragedy is unfolding along the Union's external borders, partly on account of the Member Statesâ failing policy, and I have to say, I am deeply embarrassed.
The Councilâs primary aim â if one can speak of such a thing existing at all â is to reinforce the external borders.
Frontex is the key word, but it relies on the resources and manpower supplied by the Member States, and those resources are still extremely limited.
Moreover, it is an illusion to think that the flows of immigrants can be controlled by reinforced external borders alone, not that those are something we should want either.
We must look at the reasons why immigrants choose to leave their countries in droves.
The link between immigration and development is paramount. Large-scale and strategic investments in the countries of origin are necessary.
You might well want to call it a modern Marshall Plan.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you should follow the example set by Commissioner Frattini, who has, on a number of occasions, asked you to consider a total package of measures, which alone will enable the Union to have any impact, so I urge you to realise your ambitions, as enshrined in the Tampere programme and confirmed at The Hague, to get stuck into this so important link between immigration and development, establish those cooperation agreements with the countries of origin and transit, draft, as a matter of urgency, a European return policy according to which everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, launch those information campaigns, make sure this European green card becomes a reality, and deal with your own black market in labour.
I should like to urge the Council, to use its own metaphor, to pedal as fast as it can.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, exactly a year ago, more than 11 and perhaps as many as 16 migrants were shot dead in Ceuta and Melilla.
Were the bullets Spanish or Moroccan?
We do not know, and no inquiry has been conducted.
All that we know at present is that one of those killed was from Cameroon. As for the others, no one has any idea who they were.
Have we learned the lessons of this tragedy?
Not at all, because, in July, three other migrants died â in Melilla, I think â and pressure continues to be exerted on Morocco to sign a readmission agreement even though we have, since then, seen evidence every day that police roundups and deportations into the desert are continuing in this country, as well as violations of the fundamental rights of migrants, including those with papers from the High Commissioner for Refugees.
What lessons have we learned from this tragedy?
The pressure we continue to put on Morocco has simply caused migrants to take ever more perilous routes further to the south.
A few years ago, the idea of reaching the Canaries in small motor boats would have been absolutely unthinkable.
Today, it is a reality experienced by many.
We know how many of these people arrive in the Canary Islands. We do not know how many left Africa.
Thousands, perhaps.
Who are they, and what are their names? How many people have perished in this way in Mauritanian or Senegalese waters?
What is the policy in question, and what, MrÂ Frattini, do I hear you say in your interviews?
I hear you say that you want a European armada, with patrols, aircraft, boats and military helicopters; that you want, indeed, to protect our borders.
That is what I read and what I hear you say, MrÂ Frattini.
Why this bellicose language?
Have we gone to war against migrants?
European Union policy has entered an absolutely vicious circle.
We are buying third countriesâ collaboration in supervising their own frontiers, that is to say we are shutting migrants into their own countries.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Frattini, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, the thousands of people who have died in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean have made a mistake, and that is to have been born people.
If they had been born goods or currency â if possible the pound, the dollar or the euro â the European Union would have reacted in a different, very hospitable, manner.
They were born people, however, my friends.
They have committed the terrible crime of leaving their countries to escape hunger or war and to try to live in peace.
That is the crime they have committed.
I would beg the Commission and the Council never again to discuss terrorism and immigration at the same time.
It is an affront to civilisation.
I would beg you never to do it again. Because if you do, you encourage speeches like that of Mr Le Pen â fascist, racist and xenophobic â or actions such as those of countries that are European, but not members of the Union, such as Switzerland, which are very welcoming when it comes to financial flows, banking flows, my friend, but when it comes to people, they even call into question the right to request asylum.
That should not be the European Unionâs message.
I therefore believe that we must entirely change our approach.
They are people and they deserve a civilised response.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would like to raise the issue of so-called forced labour camps.
One such camp became public knowledge a few months ago.
It was located in the south of Italy and run by an international criminal gang who forced foreign labourers, mostly Poles, to work and even went as far as murdering some of those who tried to escape.
I should also like to take this opportunity to say a few words of praise for the actions of a certain Italian lady who has spontaneously taken it upon herself to care for the grave of an unknown worker who was murdered there.
She is an old lady with a low income.
Her gesture has been reported in the Italian and Polish press, and I would like to convey my deep gratitude to her.
This really is a very serious problem.
It is likely that the camp discovered is not the only one of its kind.
Indeed, there are many indications in the press that similar camps probably exist in other countries.
It is therefore incumbent on us to place this matter at the top of our agenda.
Â Â  â Mr President, the ability to control oneâs borders and decide who should be a citizen in your country is one of the most basic characteristics of a nation state, and in that regard the UK is very lucky because we are not part of the continent of Europe.
We are an island, we have our own natural borders and it is for that reason that I, and the vast majority of the British population, do not want immigration to be controlled at a European level, believing it far better that we organise it for ourselves.
But while I am here listening to these debates I am struck that too often we are talking about immigration from third countries, from outside the European Union coming in; we are not talking about what is going on between the Member States.
Just yesterday there was an announcement that two very poor eastern European countries â Romania and Bulgaria â will join the EU.
Well, it is perfectly obvious that if you have the free movement of peoples between countries with vastly differing levels of wealth it will lead to a huge migratory flow; all of which makes me wonder how on earth Commission President Barroso can have decided that he is going to make a Romanian the new Immigration Commissioner!
This debate goes to the very heart of what the EU is all about, and it is becoming perfectly obvious that no nation can control its own borders, decide its own immigration policy, and at the same time remain part of the European Union.
When this argument gets out there amongst the peoples of Europe, it will be a potentially explosive issue, because once again we have the political class here in the institutions of Brussels and Strasbourg heading in one direction, and public opinion demanding that you head in completely the opposite direction.
You may have got away with it on previous policies, but on the question of immigration you will not.
You have been warned!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the first decision made by MrÂ Prodiâs new government in Italy was to legalise the situation of 500Â 000 illegal immigrants, and with the family reunion policies that figure will easily reach at least a million.
The Zapatero government in Spain has done the same, legalising 700Â 000 illegal immigrants.
The other European Union countries are therefore entitled to wonder what the aim of such measures might be, other than political demagogy.
We have to wonder why the European institutions never dare to insist that these governments face their responsibilities.
In Italy, however, the Prodi government has gone further, even altering Community law by making it possible to claim political asylum even in situations that do not fulfil the strict criteria, which we endorse and which are legally required for recognition of political asylum â a fundamental aspect of the freedoms associated with human rights.
The privileges of political asylum are even granted to immigrants who do not come from unsafe countries where human rights are not respected, or from war zones.
They just need to have applied for asylum or, if their application has been rejected, to be waiting for the end of the lengthy appeals procedure.
These policies run counter to the strict immigration policy being sketched out today by the European institutions, not least since we are talking about tightening up the asylum principle.
It could be said, however, that such measures may become a means of getting round the rules, which are designed precisely to keep the problem under control.
So I say, thank you, Switzerland!
Thank you, Christoph Blocker!
Long live Switzerland!
No more demagogy in Europe on immigration!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, once again we are taking stock here in this Chamber of the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice.
We should acknowledge that whereas much has been done, much besides remains to be done.
I refer to the favourable comments made by MrÂ RajamÃ€ki as regards the conclusion of the Schengen Information System (SIS) dossier.
I hope it will be possible to vote quickly for a compromise at first reading providing us with the legal instrument needed to implement the second generation of SIS.
I should also like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for including the issue of immigration in the priorities for the forthcoming European Council.
Hopefully, the Council will respond favourably to our request to broaden the codecision process to cover legal immigration and integration.
We want to see more democratic legitimacy and a common European approach to migration that is based on the principles of cohesion and solidarity and that covers the integration of immigrants living legally in Europe.
I was pleased to hear you speak about the recent events in the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki.
Urgent, practical measures are needed in the area of maritime operational cooperation with a view to developing adequate surveillance capacities at our sea borders and to setting up rapid border intervention teams.
I especially welcome MrÂ Frattini's remarks about the need to ensure that the Community instruments are given the necessary resources.
Frontex, for example, must not be deprived of the financial resources it needs to carry out its work.
Lastly, immigration policy must cover the unremitting fight against illegal immigration and against the trafficking of human beings, the return of illegal immigrants to their countries of origin, the opening up of channels for legal immigration, and cooperation and support for the development of countries of origin.
MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, we must condemn the extraordinary mass regularisation of immigrants, as happened in Spain in May of last year.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking MrÂ Cavada, who has inspired a debate on an absolutely crucial issue: the area of freedom, security and justice.
I would like to focus on the issue of immigration.
Minister, seven years have passed since Tampere.
I was there in a different capacity.
Work began there on immigration and on a common policy relating to it, and today the Vice-President of the Commission, MrÂ Frattini, has made a speech full of passion and information in support of that policy.
I believe that this year the Commission has begun to react seriously and the assistance of a number of countries has contributed to that, particularly the countries most affected: the countries of the South.
It has made many promises for the future.
While I agree with him on the need for a common policy and for the unified leadership and coordination that he has advocated in the Commission, I would like to say to Vice-President Frattini that âactions speak louder than wordsâ.
In last yearâs budget, which is being discharged, 80% of the heading corresponding to immigration has not been spent.
I would remind you that, when the events in the Canary Islands took place, the Commissionerâs spokesman said that there was no money.
I would draw your attention to something else, and that is that the money needed cannot be taken from development cooperation, because that would mean robbing Peter to pay Paul.
I believe that that is also important.
He has promised us an active policy of investments; I believe that, with regard to Africa, it is the âpush effect' â which is the really important thing, since it is stupid to think that Africans spend all day reading the Official Journal of the European Communities or the official State bulletins of all of the countries â that must lead us to a common policy, to common immigration criteria and to an active policy with regard to our needs.
If we are to take a constructive approach, Mr President, that is what we must do.
I welcome the step that has been taken, but I hope that it will have serious consequences for the future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, this is a difficult thing for me to say, but MrÂ Schulz is absolutely right in everything he has said.
I do not think I have ever said that in this House before, and it does not seem likely that I will ever do it again, but he has spelled out where the problem lies, namely in balancing the sovereignty of the Member States against the Unionâs capacity to act.
How much are the Member States prepared to concede, and how much capacity to act do they want the EU to have?
This is aptly reflected in the saying to the effect that the spirit is willing, but the flesh weak.
Perhaps, in this instance, it will be the German Presidency of the Council that will send out the signal that moves the European Union further ahead, but I have to say that I would like to see Finland and Portugal acting as particle accelerators, for Germany, although large, is sluggish; it is comparable with France in being a country with great traditions, but not much in the way of speed.
Like an oil tanker, it is slow and unmanoeuvrable, and less innovative than countries like Finland where these matters are concerned, and so I ask that you help the German Presidency of the Council to make it easier to weigh up where the fundamental key issues are.
On the subject of immigration, GÃŒnther Beckstein, the Bavarian Interior Minister, made a disastrous error when he claimed that it would not be too much to expect Spain to take in 25Â 000 people, for what matters is not whether or not it is reasonable that they should be expected; the real point is that the fate of people â people in desperate need â waiting offshore, is at stake.
As far as migration in search of work is concerned, the German Federal Interior Minister, Wolfgang SchÃ€uble, made it abundantly clear that legal migration cannot be considered in isolation from the labour market, so we know that nothing is happening on that front either, and, as for the Human Rights Agency that is so important to you, what the German Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, had to say about that was, in effect, âwell, yes, all right, if we do not have any choice in the matter, but why do we have to have an agency to watch over our own fundamental rights?â
You can see, then, where the problem lies, so I ask you to put your particle-accelerating skills to use; you can enable Germany to make a good job of its term in the Council Presidency.
At the moment, it is a prospect that fills me with foreboding.
Â Â  Mr President, I am delighted to see that there is so much consensus on the fundamental premise: that the phenomenon of immigration is a current and growing phenomenon and that it is not going to stop despite some peopleâs desire to put up barriers and walls in the sea.
What we need to do from now on, as others have said, is to regulate those migratory flows, but to regulate them on the basis of policy and, more specifically, on the basis of European policy.
Let there be no doubt, the people who come to the Canaries are not coming to stay there.
They are passing through the Canaries.
It is an entry point to Europe; it would appear that some of our fellow Members from other countries have not yet understood that.
They are not going to the Canaries for their holidays.
It is a way of getting into Europe. That is where we have to provide the resources.
We cannot leave the responsibility for dealing with this issue solely to the Spanish or Canary Islands authorities.
I do not therefore understand, and even less share, the reticence about using the passerelle procedure and communitising this issue from the point of view of collective responsibility.
I do not understand why there is so much fear and reticence about accepting a European approach to an issue that cannot be seen in any other way.
Please allow me to add another concern.
We must not employ an ostrich-like policy and delegate or transfer responsibility for these flows to countries that are well known for their lack of respect for human rights, such as Morocco or Libya, for example.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are many of us who have for years been fighting for the basic principles of the rule of law.
In particular, we have fought for legal certainty, which is of course protection in relation to the police and other forces of the state, especially for societyâs underprivileged.
The fight has, in general, been in vain.
Never has legal certainty been exposed to such serious threats as it is today.
The EU Treatyâs âarea of freedom, security and justiceâ is at best a myth or, rather, perhaps, a piece of juridico-political deception, concealing the systematic destruction of the rule of law.
Moreover, none of the EUâs institutions has shown an ability to implement the eminently necessary change of course.
There is only room for two messages.
The first is that, without having committed crimes on the scale of the United States â with GuantÃ¡namo and other torture centres around the world â the EU and the Member States commit outrages every day against both terrorist suspects and refugees who have no rights.
The âFort Europeâ police state is dangerously near.
Secondly, the EUâs institutions have no desire to find any explanation for the two basic problems that are at the root of the evils.
The most important cause where both points are concerned is, purely and simply, economic and social inequality in the world: inequality that increases each day as a direct consequence of the EUâs policy towards, and oppression of, the worldâs poorest countries.
This is the root of the evil.
Only in acknowledging this will the necessary legal policy acquire any meaning.
Â Â  If, seven years after the adoption of a programme for strengthening the European Unionâs external borders in order to check uncontrolled immigration, the task still remains undone, it is clear that the European Unionâs common immigration policy is still a matter for the future.
The arguments that are used in defence of uncontrolled immigration do not withstand criticism.
Immigrants do little to help stabilise adverse demographic trends in Europe, since the jobless rate amongst immigrants significantly exceeds average levels.
The fact that unemployment indicators also maintain the same trend amongst immigrants from second-world countries demonstrates that the task of integrating immigrants does not form part of Member Statesâ immigration policies.
In actual fact, the labour market is often closed to immigrants, and this leads the Member States to open up their social insurance systems.
In turn, this is perceived as an invitation by immigrants in âdonorâ countries.
I would like to say something about Europeâs common immigration policy.
In the short term, together with significant improvement to the European Unionâs external border controls it is necessary to come to an agreement on a comprehensive and structured immigration policy. This should be based on an assessment of the Member Statesâ employment markets and Member Statesâ potential to integrate immigrants.
In the medium term, together with a significant improvement in the quality of the aid programmes designed for developing world countries, the Member States must be able to agree on an important revision to the European Unionâs existing import and export policies, particularly in the sphere of agricultural products.
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, fellow Members, we have heard MrÂ Frattini complain about our not being able to protect Europeâs southern borders, rightly pointing out that an illegal immigrant who succeeds in getting into Spain or Italy can be in Lille or Hamburg within a day, and heard him propose, like MrÂ Sarkozy, that the right of veto be completely abolished.
This is one more example of European integration being used as a solution to the problems it presents.
Have not most of the parties represented in this House opened the floodgates to uncontrolled immigration by means of the Schengen agreements and the Treaty of Amsterdam, thereby depriving the Member States of their competence in this matter?
The Commission is now freezing the readmission agreements between Member States and interfering in family reunification policies and even wishes to bring in 25 million additional immigrants to curb the population decline.
No, ladies and gentlemen, it is not possible to takes turns in power for 30 years and then, as soon as the elections come along, make out that one is not responsible for the current situation.
Moreover, we are also supposed to go further in the headlong flight towards federalism.
Frankly, if you want to destroy European civilisation, just continue as you are.
Â Â  â Today we are speaking about progress in the area of freedom, security and justice.
Talk of progress is premature, however, when the Commission is unable or unwilling to honour its commitments for 2007 as regards the expansion of the Schengen area.
I find it unacceptable that citizens of the ten new Member States will not be able to move freely across EU internal borders by the promised time, namely October of next year.
It is inexplicable, in my view, that they will be subject to border police controls for a further two to three years.
The Commission ought to behave not like a bunch of interlopers but like a body elected by this Parliament and extraordinarily well paid by the taxpayer.
If it is incapable of getting the conditions in place for the Schengen area then it is incompetent.
If it is simply hiding behind technical difficulties and wants to defer freedom of movement, then it is not to be trusted.
MrÂ Barroso and his Commissioners are now hampering the free movement of people, which is one of the pillars of the EU.
They should be aware of the extent to which they are risking the publicâs trust in the Europe project in its current form.
Â Â  Mr President, here we are again.
Mr Schulz was quite right.
I dusted my 1999 speech down, Mr Schulz left the Chamber after his speech, various other things remain just the same as they were seven years ago.
There is a lot of grey hair in this Chamber â not on me, of course.
It is true that we have the same issues and I myself believe in pragmatic inactivity as being something we should not always be concerned about.
In this particular area, at a time of great terrorist threat â and there were terrorist threats in 1999 as well â there is a very uncertain message being sent out that the Presidency and the Commission and, regrettably, too many of those sitting in this House then and now seem to think that the most pressing need is to bring in the under Article 42.
I have always had reservations about imposing a single model of justice on countries where there are different legal systems evolving in different ways.
In the case of the UK, our system of civil law is the greatest legacy of the great Angevin king Henry II, which developed with great success for over 800 years.
Equally, we have not experienced the Napoleonic Code imposed throughout much of Europe 200 years ago.
Even though we cannot apply that system, we have never wished to stop others doing so where it is appropriate.
Even on its own terms, the move to harmonisation is flawed.
The ruling in the Cassis de Dijon case was one of the key moments in the development of the internal market, giving precedence to the principle of mutual recognition over blanket harmonisation.
The Council is due to present its mid-term review of The Hague Programme at the end of the year.
As Piet Hein Donner, the midwife of the programme, has said, the first principle is the implementation of mutual recognition as the fundament for judicial cooperation.
The programme is founded on the assumption of cooperation.
Cooperation should determine the dynamics and development of European collaboration.
I believe that is a practical and sensible approach, one which is showing signs of success and I urge the Presidency and the Commission to proceed on those lines.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on such a sensitive subject, we really must avoid having a dialogue in which nobody listens.
Instead, it is a good idea to begin to lay down some points of reference.
The first point of reference is the subject of immigration, which is a challenge for us all.
We need only think about what happened this summer: once again, tens of thousands of people landed on Lampedusa and the Canaries, or it would be better to say that they arrived in Europe.
Spain, Italy and sometimes Cyprus and Greece have often been merely gateways through which these people pour in, as they do not just stay by the gates.
As President Borrell Fontelles, Commissioner Frattini and now the President-in-Office of the Council have also pointed out, that is why it is not just a case of a humanitarian emergency or a one-off event; above all it is a structural problem, which is testing the whole European Union and its ability to implement a European immigration policy at last.
Such a policy is needed not in order to do any particular Member State a favour, but because the Union as a whole is involved.
The second point of reference is that even those of us in positions of responsibility must not make the mistake of confusing immigration with terrorism, because that above all makes the people of Europe feel afraid and insecure.
Instead, we should perhaps introduce a different paradigm: that of immigration and slavery, since many of these immigrants are beginning to be associated with that in certain Member States.
The third point of reference is more positive, however: we have to acknowledge that we are facing a new challenge for our civilisation to address.
Such an awareness lies at the heart of the cultural and political leap that the Union has to make on immigration.
It is not a marginal issue that only affects a few of us, but a new commitment that the Union needs to adopt as one of the new Millennium goals, and we have already clearly spelt out what that means.
MrÂ Frattini, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, we are aware that all of this will meet with considerable resistance from many governments, but if this Parliament has a role to play, then it is to exert pressure, to commit itself and to send out the message: âLet us do something about it.â
We need to tell the governments that are frightened that it is also a way to rebuild trust between the Union and its citizens, by showing that the Union exists and can make its presence felt.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a red herring to say that we cannot get effective EU action on crime, terrorism and civil liberties without a new Constitution.
Mr Schulz, your outrage was as entertaining as ever, but it is your Government and Mrs Klamtâs which is using that pretext from Berlin.
We get endless speeches and conferences saying that terrorism, racism and immigration are top challenges â which they are; but the Commission still cannot tell us if states have implemented the five-year-old anti-terrorism law, and states are only just moving forward on a four-year-old proposal to tackle race hate crime.
There is no common EU policy on migration.
We are told today by the Council that safeguarding human rights is a priority for EU governments.
If that is so, how come foreign ministers were unable recently to make any formal response to President Bushâs admission of CIA secret prisons, just as they were unable to do anything about GuantÃ¡namo for four years?
This system is dysfunctional and ineffective in fighting terrorism and upholding human rights. It is a betrayal of the 21st-century security needs of what will soon be half a billion people.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, immigration goes on whether we want it to or not; the only thing that matters is how we handle it.
Europe needs immigrants, and the idea of Europe as a fortress with wealth within and poverty without is unsustainable.
This proposal may well be well-intentioned, but it is nevertheless not a good one; it is a party-political compromise lacking sufficient vision.
The current practice of sending foreigners back from southern Europe and northern Africa is brutal, inhumane and ethically indefensible; we have forgotten how to act in accordance with the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity.
Our approach to human rights is highly hypocritical, and we are disregarding the Geneva Convention on Refugees.
Â Â  â I should like to use this two-minute speech on the important issue of immigration, which in view of its multi-faceted nature would require a great deal longer, to call for the following:
- An end to repressive, securitarian policies that criminalise immigrants, who after all are just men and women looking for a job and a decent life;
- The closure of immigrant detention centres and an end to the inhuman policy of deportation;
- The fight against traffickers in human beings and their accomplices to be stepped up;
- The fight against xenophobia and racism, and against all policies and distorted views feeding these attitudes, to be stepped up;
- The regularisation of immigrant workers, ensuring their labour and social rights, a crucial prerequisite for putting an end to the appalling phenomenon of exploitation;
- An effective immigration policy that specifically includes family reunification;
- A policy that reverses the current trend towards concentrating wealth in the hands of the few at the expense of the exploitation and poverty of millions and millions of human beings.
I should also like to quote some statistics from the United Nations: The 691 richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to USDÂ 2.2Â billion, which is equal to the combined wealth of the 145 poorest countries.
What is more, the 500 richest people have a combined income higher than that of the 416Â million poorest.
The 8Â million richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to 80% of the GDP of all the countries in the world.
- In other words, what is needed is a policy that uses the human raceâs ample resources, means and advances in science and technology to effectively resolve the problems facing the peoples of the world.
