My answer is a heartfelt 'yes', because that is good for Turkey and for Europe.
Mr President, Mr Oostlander has written an honest, critical, as well as fair, report on Turkey's application for membership of the European Union.
Political clarity is something from which, ultimately, all parties involved benefit.
I share the rapporteur's view - and I would refer to paragraph 52 - that, at present, Turkey does not fulfil the conditions for the opening of accession negotiations.
The report underpins this frank conclusion in a convincing manner.
Three fundamental inconsistencies with the political criteria of Copenhagen - which are, after all, essential accession conditions - are all-important in this connection: firstly, the army's dominant position in the Turkish state and society, for which, see paragraphs 7, 8 and 9; secondly, the constant discrimination against religious minorities, particularly that of Christian denominations (paragraph 39); and thirdly, the disturbing Kurdish issue, mentioned in paragraphs 34, 35 and 43.
Over the past few weeks, the dominant role of the Turkish armed forces was abundantly clear from the domestic media campaign about possible tensions within the army's most senior ranks between those in favour of reform and critics of this necessary EU route.
The rumour machine says a great deal about the true relationship between civilian and military authorities.
The authority relationships in the EU Member States are completely different.
In summary, Brussels is outside Ankara's military-political range for the time being.
Meanwhile, the governing AKP does claim freedom of religion for Muslims in its own country, but, according to Western Turkey experts, does not breathe a word about the self-same constitutional right for non-Muslims.
The urgent call on the Commission in paragraph 40 to draw up a comparative study between religious freedom in Turkey and the EU Member States is therefore opportune.
I would join the rapporteur in calling on the Turkish authorities to take the Kurdish South-East under their wing in earnest.
The Council and the Commission ought to give their 100% backing to a comprehensive development plan for this seriously underdeveloped region.
A helping hand of this kind to Turkey would do the Kurdish citizens a world of good, both internally and externally, and I would add this for the sake of Mr Oostlander, even independently of EU relations.
Mr President, the situation of a country with the recognised status of candidate for accession to the European Union which allows old tubs full of illegal migrants to leave its ports, as happened a week ago, is peculiar.
How can a state which bears great resemblance to a police state, like the Turkish state, which is so effective at controlling political opponents and minorities, display such weakness and inefficiency when it comes to the traffickers of the highly powerful Turkish mafia?
This is a point which warrants close attention on our part as we now prepare to assess the conditions for accession.
The report, which I consider to be very well-balanced, and I endorse the firm statement contained in paragraph 52, makes no mention of the genocide of the Armenian people: this may be the result of intense lobbying, of pressure put on the Members of Parliament by the Turkish Government.
We must not forget the rights of the Diaspora - of the children of the victims of that holocaust - who are spread throughout Europe and are European citizens, just like us.
The situation, as described by the Human Rights Association, is certainly not encouraging: a political police which interrogates, tortures and rapes women, especially Kurdish women, and ongoing persecution of ethnic and religious minorities.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the report by Mr Oostlander on Turkey is one of the many which have been submitted from time to time to the European Parliament in connection with the various aspects of relations between this problematic country and the international community and the European Union in particular.
The Oostlander report, however, over and above its more general objective and balanced formulations, is mainly characterised by the clarity and frankness with which it notes and brands Turkey's permanent weaknesses, shortcomings and imperfections in the fields of the rule of law, democratic governance, human and minority rights and its lawful international conduct.
In other words, something that should have been done a long time ago, instead of the practice to date of avoiding any candid description of reality for various reasons which serve political and other interests, by demonstrating a poorly conceived tolerance, by having two sets of weights and measures and by citing misleadingly labelled arguments, such as the strategic importance of Turkey, the beloved pretext of its trans-Atlantic protectors, or the alleged need to send positive messages to Ankara - as we heard for the umpteenth time just now - and so on.



The unproductive results of this essential beautification of what is a wholly reprehensible and censurable situation are now obvious and, with all due respect Mr President-in-Office, even the most dreamy apologists of the lenient treatment of and attempts at rapprochement with Turkey must be disappointed, because not even the positive messages which have been sent out for years have resulted in a correspondingly positive response from Turkey, nor has European tolerance been duly appreciated by the Turkish establishment which, on the contrary, has taken it - and perhaps rightly so - as encouragement and acceptance of its policy, whereas if the European position had been expressed earlier with the same courageous honesty of the Oostlander report, perhaps the prospects of the so-called European orientation of Turkey would be more auspicious and there would be fewer reasonable reservations and doubts as to the extent to which this country is legally entitled to be even a candidate for integration into the European family.
As it is better late than never, however, and with the even faint hope that Ankara will finally understand the real message of the European Parliament and will proceed accordingly in its choices, I unreservedly support the Oostlander report.
Mr President, I should like to take advantage of the debate on Mr Oostlander's exceptional report on the accession of Turkey to the European Union to state once again that I remain a firm supporter of its accession.
This position on my part is based on the following reasons:
First, as a Greek I should like this neighbouring country of Greece's to grow and develop the creative ability of its people within the democratic frameworks which the European Union safeguards all its members.
I believe that the Greek people and the Turkish people will have a unique opportunity to cooperate in the joint effort for a peaceful and prosperous Europe and mutually supportive, deeper bilateral relations between them.
Secondly, as a socialist, I should like to see a democratic Turkey safeguard institutional guarantees for all the freedoms of its citizens so that they can intervene creatively and unimpeded in the development of their society in accordance with the desires, expectations, inspirations and output of their work.
I believe that the economic and cultural development of Turkey as the consequence of the freedom of action of its citizens under the rule of law will have exponential benefits for Turkey itself to start with, for the European Union certainly and, without any shadow of a doubt, for rapprochement, understanding and cooperation on the part of the countries and peoples neighbouring Turkey.
Thirdly, there is a personal reason why I champion the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
I am convinced that the interventions of the military in the political life of a country, either directly or indirectly, do not solve any problems.
On the contrary, they cause problems and impasses to accumulate in their country.
I have no particular regard for or trust in nation-saving soldiers the world over, who see any free expression or action as a military target to be neutralised using every means, not excluding, of course, bans, imprisonment, torture and natural extermination.
Turkey's European prospects therefore depend on the soldiers returning to their barracks and being supervised by the political leadership democratically elected by the people to govern them.
Thirty years ago, when a military junta took it upon itself to bring the Greek people to their senses from the excesses of their democratic excitement, the EEC, as it was then, froze the association agreement with Greece and that helped us considerably in restoring democratic normalcy to my country.
The personal reason I referred to earlier has to do with the fights and experiences of that era.
This is an opportunity for the Turkish people to enjoy a smooth transition, without sacrifice and tragic consequences, to a fully operational parliamentary democracy, a democracy with all its accompanying parameters.
The European challenge, therefore, also serves Turkey's democratic prospects.
Turkey must interpret this challenge as a unique opportunity on its course towards Europe.
It is in its hands, its political leadership wants it and the Oostlander report lays down the preconditions for avoiding misunderstandings.
Mr President, Mr Oostlander's report has been quite substantially modified at the committee stage, as other honourable Members have already commented. It is now more balanced, and this is undoubtedly an improvement.
It is to be expected that a report like this one should make mention of a certain number of deficiencies and lapses, especially relating to issues of human rights and public freedoms.
On all these points, I believe one can only agree with the rapporteur.
On the other hand, I cannot agree as fully with one of the rapporteur's personal preferences, which, though concealed for the most part by the amendments, is nevertheless latent and sometimes explicit. I am referring to what I would term Mr Oostlander's pathological aversion to secularism and the secular ideal.
This aversion also made an appearance in the brief oral presentation during which he mentioned what he called Turkey's political philosophy. Through a consideration of the historical context, he likened this philosophy to totalitarianism, one of the most monstrous forms of political oppression Europe has ever spawned.
In point of fact, Mr Oostlander, Kemalism was by no means a totalitarian system, and did not follow totalitarian models.
Kemalism, which was unquestionably a form of enlightened despotism, set out to modernise Turkey rapidly, drawing its inspiration to a not inconsiderable degree from Western European democratic models, most notably those of the separation of Church and State and secular republicanism.
You see, Mr Oostlander, as Turkey applies to join the European Union (and it is natural for that application to give rise to discussion and even argument), any pride it can take today in its positive historical legacy is attributable to that very attempt to introduce our European secularism into a Muslim society.
For that, as some of the honourable Members have said, is the challenge, or one of the challenges, of the twenty-first century.
I do not think there is any justification for adopting the disgruntled attitude you have shown towards the secular ideal in recital G of your report. Today's Europe is rooted in that ideal, which stands out with great clarity, to my mind, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights we have accepted.
You ought to adopt the opposite stance, welcoming the secular ideal more warmly and valuing it more highly.
Mr President, Turkey had the right to apply for membership.
I believe that it will have the right to remain at the application stage for some time, for its progress is slow and must be monitored closely by us.
That does not give us licence simply to parrot the phrase 'some progress, but could do better if he tried', so beloved of schoolteachers. We must not forget that application for membership of the European Union is akin, for Turkey, to the United States' experience of the concept of the frontier at the end of the nineteenth century.
That kind of stirring, pioneering front provides the impetus to move further on.
From that perspective, we must encourage Turkey's application.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the AtatÃŒrk legacy is double-edged and somewhat ambiguous.
On the one hand there is the secular state, on the other the strong position of the Turkish army reflected in the power of the National Security Council, which implies military power over civilians.
In a real democracy, this should actually be the other way round.
How can the secular state in Turkey be maintained and democracy established?
The army cannot be the ultimate guarantee for democracy, so far-reaching reforms are called for here.
As is abundantly clear from the Oostlander report, the country is not yet a democracy as long as human rights are violated and as long as the rights of minorities are not absolutely guaranteed.
Torture is a matter of daily practice.
The position of the Kurdish language, the exclusion of the Kurds from political life, or at least the attempt to exclude them, is evidence of the fact that they do not want a political solution to this important conflict of nationalities.
The threat of fundamentalism remains, although the AKP has adopted a reformist policy.
We recognise that major progress has been made in legislation, such as the abolition of capital punishment, but far-reaching reforms have not yet been carried out.
In paragraph 11 of the Oostlander report, it is suggested that serious work be done on constitutional matters.
Needless to say, this cannot be a condition, but it is still worthwhile to suggest that a new constitution be put in place, one that makes room for human rights, but also for the autonomous Kurdish community, and one in which the position of minorities is safeguarded.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Oostlander.
This is a splendid report, which lists all the critical points without offending Turkey.
It is fair and open, and I believe that anyone applying for accession has the right to be treated fairly and openly.
Second, I would like to contradict both of the previous speakers.
It is not - as is written in the minority opinion - about precepts of an almost parareligious nature; clause 3 states specifically that fundamental European values, although based on the Judeo-Christian legacy, but also encompassing the values of the Enlightenment, do not stand in the way of the accession of a Muslim state in principle.
In view of what you, Mr Nordmann and Mrs Maes, have just said with regard to secularism in Turkey, I can only call upon you to inform yourselves!
There is no freedom of religion, and there is no secularism along French lines.
Secularism in Turkey means 130 000 state employees monitoring and harassing the non-Muslim minority.
There are no rights for Christian religions in Turkey.
Separation of state and religion is one thing, but guaranteeing freedom of religion is another.
It is an inalienable part of the European system of values that every individual should be allowed to live according to his or her religion and practise it.
In Turkey, this is not guaranteed.
Until 1954, it was a punishable offence to provide religious instruction.
I therefore really entreat you to inform yourselves on this issue.
The other points mentioned were the role of the army, minority rights for the Kurds, the right to vote, in other words the fact that the 10% hurdle is still in place, the imprisonment of persons motivated by political or moral conviction such as Leyla Zana, who will soon have spent ten years in prison for speaking freely, or the issue of the heritage of the Armenians and Syrians, which is not protected at present in Turkey.
It is a long list, and one that Turkey must work through.
That is its obligation.
I especially welcome the point made in clause 52 of the report that, in the light of the Copenhagen decision, this is not the start of negotiations.
For this to happen, the conditions must be met.
This will be reviewed at the end of 2004.
I also agree with the fact that the review is not to take place now, but at the end of 2004.
Furthermore, as an interim report, this report can in no way signify that Parliament has committed itself one way or another with regard to a later decision to approve or reject Turkey's application for accession.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I truly hope - and I say this from the bottom of my heart - I truly hope that Turkey will one day be a democratic country, for then some people in this House will find it hard to formulate speeches.
My dear Mr Langen, I think very highly of you, but I have heard this speech often in the past, irrespective of what is happening in Turkey.
It will no longer be possible to make some of these speeches because they always say the same thing, no matter what is going on in Turkey.
In reality - and Commissioner Verheugen discussed this in some detail - we can see that a great deal is happening, but that it is not enough - quite right! We want more, we criticise Turkey - quite right!
Please be honest, however, ladies and gentlemen! For many of you - you have heard only four speeches - all the human rights and civil rights are nothing but a facade.
Many of you simply do not want Turkey.
Just say it honestly, and then we will know where we stand.
Let us tell Turkey straight, and we can dispense with this performance!
Anything else really is just a performance.
As a Member of this House I am pleased that the Council and the Commission have a greater degree of competence as regards shaping foreign policy, because the Parliament of which I am a Member is not capable of doing so.
Mr President, I recently drove over one of the two bridges between Istanbul and ÃskÃŒdar.
It struck me how simple it is to cross the Bosphorus, even simpler than crossing the Ãresund between Sweden and Denmark.
The Bosphorus Bridge took me from the more ancient Istanbul to the more modern ÃskÃŒdar.
There is no sense of passing from one part of the world to another.
Helsinki, in Finland, is still further to the east than ÃskÃŒdar on the shore of Anatolia.
The assertion that the Bosphorus divides two parts of the world and that the EU must stop there is both inane and vacuous.
We should instead be delighted to take on board the interest shown by Turkey in becoming a member of the EU.
We should give the country the help it needs in order to reform itself and become a perfectly satisfactory future candidate country.
Turkey is a worthy European cooperation partner.
Having been a member of NATO for many years and being adjacent to more troubled and conflict-ridden areas, Turkey would remain a key country as a future cooperation partner.
To try to set up religious obstacles to Turkish membership of the EU would be not only deeply unfortunate but also downright unchristian.
The report before us makes demands of Turkey, demands that must be met if EU membership is to be possible.
The report, which is very constructive, nonetheless holds the door clearly open in order to facilitate the future accession of Turkey.
The appropriately named Mr Oostlander might be said genuinely to have succeeded with this report on the East.
Mr President, I would like to associate myself with the comments of Mr Ceyhun, and the excellent and formidable contribution of Mr Nordmann.
There is a whiff of hypocrisy when this House turns to look at Turkey: I do not see the same approach and the same attitude to the other accession and candidate countries.
I would put to the honourable Members here today that if the same criteria had been applied, the histories of some of the current Member States would have disbarred them from membership of the European Union.
What we have to send today is a message that we are consistent in the application of our principle.
We have to support the reformers, we have to encourage change; or we do the reverse, we discourage the reformers, bring about the growth of fundamentalism and shut the door on Turkey forever.
I am pleased at the comments from the Commissioner.
A lot has been achieved, the reforms are impressive and it is right that we should acknowledge that.
The President-in-Office of the Council said there are two priority areas.
My priority areas are these: to encourage reform and to accelerate the process of reform.
The perception in Turkey (I was there ten days ago), amongst politicians and ordinary men and women, is that the European Union does not want Turkey to join.
Sadly, in this debate that prejudice, I feel, has been reinforced.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nordmann expressed himself in the most eloquent terms.
Following the example of Mr Cashman just now, I would also like to declare my support for Mr Nordmann and, taking up his arguments, join him in expressing the conviction that there are many unspoken prejudices in this report. Such prejudices should not figure in an objective account of the state of a nation.
Naturally, the political beliefs of all interested parties should be respected.
I subscribe, however, to what the honourable Member said about secularism and about a consideration of the very essence of the Kemalist state. Such a consideration was entirely absent from the report, as was, by all appearances, any mention of the efforts of the current Prime Minister of Turkey to bind his country securely to Europe.
In this context, Mr Oostlander, if this Parliament had been given the possibility of producing a report as detailed as this one not only on the countries applying for accession, but also on the current Member States of the Union (I am thinking here of my own country), the fact is that it would have taken not 56 paragraphs, but perhaps twice that, to deal with conditions in Italian prisons, the state of the Italian legal system, and many other areas besides, in which things are going badly.
In our countries too, ladies and gentlemen, or in some of our countries at least, there was a time not so long ago when people went to prison because they were Jehovah's Witnesses and did not want to do their military service. They were compelled to do it by force, or thrown into prison.
Our countries have experienced all of that.
Turkey must, of course, make significant progress.
We cannot have it both ways, however: either we offer Turkey a landfall on the coast of Europe, or else we refuse it. If we opt for the latter, we not only make a catastrophic political and strategic error: we also point Turkey, push it, in a way, towards other coasts, other shores, which would be much more dangerous not only for stability but also, I believe, for the welfare of the Turks and their progress towards democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
To this end, my radical colleagues in this Parliament and myself, together with Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank, have tabled an amendment designed precisely to avoid closing the door on Turkey, as the Oostlander report does. The first draft of this report, whose tone brought to my mind the Battle of Lepanto more than anything else, has, of course, been improved in the meantime.
We have therefore tabled an amendment in which we declare ourselves convinced that the conditions for Turkey to be admitted to the accession negotiations will be fulfilled as long as the Turkish Government pursues its current programme of essential reform with steadfastness and determination.
The rapporteur has suggested that the amendment be included as an addition, showing a desire to compromise which I applaud.
It is in a similar spirit of compromise that I accept the rapporteur's offer, following the example of the Verts/ALE Group. In doing so, I hope that we can also come to an agreement on a message to Turkey whose dominant theme is not that the door is closed, but that we are waiting for real progress.
Obviously, when the moment comes, everyone will be able to take their own decisions.
Let us at least leave that door open, however. With this in mind, I hope that the House will approve this amendment unanimously.
Mr President, Mr Oostlander has accomplished a huge, difficult task, endeavouring to reconcile the extremely diverse viewpoints expressed by Parliament on a controversial and much-debated subject such as Turkey's accession.
The result is a resolution which is acceptable as a compromise but which we might have liked to be marked and inspired by greater optimism so as to send Turkey a more positive message, as Commissioner Verheugen advocated too, despite the fact that this country still has a great deal to do and many changes and innovations to make before it can hope to join the European Union, as the resolution rightly states.
We need to establish whether geography and religion are criteria which restrict the possibility of accession or whether Europe is conceived as a set of values and principles with the result that countries that share those values and principles of democracy and freedom have the right to apply for membership.
It is in this spirit that, to Article 52 of the report, which notes that the conditions for opening negotiations are not yet in place - which is undoubtedly true at present - we prefer the version contained in Amendment No 11, to which Mr Dell'Alba referred just now, which expresses the positive view, the confidence that the requirements can be met if Turkey carries out the necessary reforms.
I too am grateful to Mr Oostlander, who appears to be willing to accept this amendment, if not as a replacement for point 52, at least as an addition to it.
Mr President, the Oostlander report has undergone a major face-lift, with 283 amendments tabled.
Certain extreme formulations, which would have compromised political relations between Parliament and Turkey, have been eliminated.
Although the report rightly points, however, down the road towards respect for human rights, along which the country still has to travel, it is nevertheless still a partial and ideologically charged report in my book. It attempts to stamp Turkey with its own view of European values.
Paragraph 3 invokes a set of European values rooted essentially in Judaeo-Christian culture. If this paragraph is not amended, it will be a slap in the face for an essentially secular country under Muslim government.
It will also be unacceptable to us Europeans, as it will mean the return of old scourges and the renewed influence of religion in political affairs.
If we must mention Judaeo-Christian values, why do we not also mention Judaeo-Christian crimes?
A re-reading of The Gospel according to Jesus Christ, by the Portuguese Nobel Prize Laureate JosÃ© Saramago, is necessary to remind us how many crimes have been committed in the name of our gods.
Well, let us take the gods out of the running.
Let us acknowledge once and for all that Europe is secular and contains many different religions. Let us also deal firmly but fairly with Turkey's application to join the European Union.
Mr President, it is important that we treat our Turkish friends with honesty and openness.
Of course, treating them honestly and openly also includes the right to be critical and to point out deficiencies.
We want to help Turkey on its path to true democracy and the rule of law.
Turkey deserves fair treatment, and Mr Oostlander's report is fair.
It describes the remarkable progress that is being made, but also states in all honesty where reform is still badly needed.
In my opinion, what is important is that Turkey itself must want to make progress in terms of meeting the Copenhagen criteria.
It must not work on these reforms primarily to appease the critics in the EU, to do us a favour, so to speak.
Turkey must embed the necessary reforms deep within its own society, and the reforms must have an impact in real life.
Constitutional amendments on paper, or new laws on paper, will not be enough on their own.
Paper is patient!
What is crucial is to implement reforms in people's daily lives.
So far, however, it is precisely this that we have yet to see.
Mr Oostlander's report describes the many shortcomings that exist in all areas.
It notes that the conditions for opening accession negotiations have not yet been met at the present time, and calls upon the Council to take a clear and consistent position at last.
The Copenhagen criteria - and this must be stressed over and over again - are not negotiable.
This applies equally to all candidate countries, and so it also applies to Turkey.
Turkey must also be fair here for once towards the EU and acknowledge this fact.
Turkey must stop passing the buck to the EU and trying to exert pressure.
It was not us who promised the Turkish people rapid accession within a few years; Turkish politics itself bears sole responsibility for this.
If Turkish politics now finds itself having to provide explanations and the population is becoming impatient, it is a problem of Turkey's own making that must be resolved in Turkey and not by the EU by softening the accession criteria.
What Turkey can expect from us - and it really can - is honesty, openness, seriousness and fairness.
Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Oostlander for his report, and to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Yiannitsis, and Commissioner Verheugen.
I feel that the Oostlander report is very well-balanced and frank.
The European Union is a Union of shared values. Thus, all the countries which have become Members in the past and those which are joining the Union now share these values and, in order to join the Union, have brought their institutional, political and economic systems into line.
This is the bottom line.
It is not the European Union which wants to become part of Turkey but Turkey which wants to subscribe to these shared values.
We must respect the diversities which make up the rich heritage of the European Union, but the limits are defined by respect for the Copenhagen criteria, for the principles of democracy and the rule of law, and these criteria and principles must not just be proclaimed but enforced and lived.
I would venture to say that the countries which intend to share our European culture may become part of the European Union.
Turkey is applying to join.
We are not opposed to this in principle.
We are waiting for the country to complete the process of adopting our cultural values.
The Erdogan government must be encouraged in the process of moving Turkey closer to the values of the European Union.
The ideological NATOists believe that Turkey's role in NATO could be its trump card when it comes to joining the European Union.
That might have been so in the past, but we now believe that NATO, with the participation of Russia, will gradually have to assume, with a slightly more effective contribution from the European Union, an international policing role, serving a United Nations which has been reformed to safeguard human rights and democracy in the countries of the world.
I hope that Turkey will be able to act on these proposals, to resolve the Cyprus issue and to establish good neighbourly relations with all the countries on its borders, resolving longstanding conflicts.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is two oral questions (B5-0094/2003 and B5-0095/2003) by Mr Brok to the Council and the Commission on a renewed transatlantic partnership for the third millennium.
Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of our chairman, Mr Brok, of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
It is imperative that we think seriously about how to foster and strengthen the transatlantic relationship today.
That is the thrust of our questions to the Council and the Commission: the development of the transatlantic partnership.
It is our view that our shortcomings in common security and defence policy have been ruthlessly exposed by the Iraq conflict and that, in consequence, has badly damaged the transatlantic partnership.
We believe that intergovernmental action still has the upper hand, and that is at the expense of the mÃ©thode communautaire in the transatlantic relationship.
Joint structures which we could develop with institutions in Brussels, perhaps under the European Convention, will assist in greater coordination.
But unless the Member States demonstrate a political will to pursue joint action, the development of the common defence and security policy in the context of the transatlantic alliance will not have the force that it both demands and deserves.
As President Bush said earlier this week in Poland, the common values that underpin that transatlantic relationship are the common foreign policy element that can bring the European Union together with the USA.
However, we cannot afford to behave in an erratic, inconsequential and fragmented manner.
The USA is such a strong partner that if the European Union cannot speak with one voice - if not a common voice, perhaps a single voice, but at least a coordinated voice - then we will continue to fall behind in the transatlantic partnership.
The European Union in this context is facing its most serious crisis of the last decade.
The question today, which we look to the Commissioner and to the Council of Ministers to answer, is whether or not we can return to a real partnership with the USA.
Can we give that partnership the new dynamism that the Committee on Foreign Affairs believes it demands and deserves, and can we be a full partner of the USA, or must we always feel that we are falling behind?
We see that there is potential for a dramatic renewal of the transatlantic alliance, and here the partnership between the EU and the USA plays the most fundamental role.
Of course, we see a stronger Europe as a condition for the very survival of Nato.
It is not just the European Union that has been damaged by the conflict in Iraq and by the outfall of that conflict; Nato and the United Nations have also been seriously damaged.
Most Member States of the European Union are an integral part of Nato, and even those who are not still believe that Nato is the fundamental guarantee for European Atlantic stability.
We, therefore, seek reassurance this afternoon that the Council of Ministers and the Commission share our view on this and that they too feel that a stronger Europe will mean a stronger Nato.
Can we from the European Union - those of us who are members and non-members - strengthen the Nato-Euro-Atlantic Alliance, since it is still a fundamental guarantee for European stability?
We therefore seek to discuss what purpose the Atlantic Alliance now serves, how the Atlantic Alliance should be structured and what means should be placed at its disposal.
Indeed, Nato itself needs reform, in particular with regard to military restructuring.
We have had many discussions lately in the context of the common security and defence policy, including with the Commissioner himself last night in the Western European Union-European Parliament joint dialogue on military restructuring, focusing in particular on full cooperation between EU Member States and our heavy investments in the modern technologies.
But how can we achieve that most effectively within the Nato context, and perhaps in a less costly way?
Institutional reform of Nato is also something we see as imperative.
Thus, we seek a coherent performance for the European Union both at home and abroad, based on consistent strategic thought and action.
We look forward to a full debate this afternoon to enable us to kick-start, with the real dimension it deserves, a proper transatlantic relationship in the post-Iraq context.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council shares the honourable Member's deep concern about the state of relations between the Union and the United States.
Although these relations basically remain strong, it is clear that their modus operandi needs to be re-examined by both sides.
The Union has made it absolutely clear that it is dealing with relations with the United States as the main priority for its foreign policy.
Working together, we can help create a better world for everyone.
The issue for the Union is how this objective will be adopted on the basis of the already very broad cooperation taking place in the western Balkans, Afghanistan, the Middle East and in connection with North Korea.
Focusing attention on issues on which the Union and the United States differ very often conceals this cooperation, which is appreciated by both sides.
As the honourable Member of Parliament knows, the High Representative will submit a document to the European Council in Thessaloniki containing recommendations for a global Union strategy in the field of foreign policy and security.
A preliminary discussion of the subject could be held in the General Affairs and External Relations Council in June.
It is obvious that, although this will be a general strategy, it will also contribute to the development of EU-USA relations.
It is also presumed that it will be based on the existing Union policy in relation, inter alia, to the role of the United Nations.
The time is right, given that this will take place just before the EU-USA summit in Washington on 25 June.
Just as the development of the foreign and security policy is allowing the Union to deal more efficiently with recent events, including its cooperation with the United States in the Middle East, Afghanistan or the western Balkans, in the field of the European security and defence policy, improving European military capabilities continues to be a high priority for the Union, so that the Union can become a more efficient partner of the United States.
The Council continues to take the view that a multilateral approach is still always the best way to resolve the various problems that we face today in various parts of the world.
The Council has not expressed an opinion on the question of adding the principle of reinforced cooperation in the field of the ESDP to the new Treaty.
When we completed the New Transatlantic Agenda, we stated that we were committed to the objective of constructing a new European architecture in the field of security in which ????, the Union, the OSCE and the Council of Europe would play complementary and mutually reinforcing roles.
This was our position in 1995 and it remains our position today.
The New Transatlantic Agenda provides the most extensive framework for cooperation with the United States.
The action plan may perhaps now be outdated, but that does not apply to the New Transatlantic Agenda.
The dialogue we have with the United States is already intensive, with countless continual contacts at all levels.
What we need is not more meetings but perhaps to focus our attention more.
We hope that the development of an overall Union strategy will renew the dialogue with the United States and increase its usefulness to the situations developing around the world.
Cooperation is still an absolute necessity in order to combat the scourge of terrorism.
Following 11 September 2001, our cooperation has extended beyond all expectations on both sides.
Over and above what is being said about differences, there is very often ignorance on both sides of the Atlantic about the essential and specific work being carried out jointly in order to combat terrorism.
The United States need Europe, just as we need the United States if we want to be successful in combating the challenges of this century.
The Council is fully aware of the fact that, if we are to succeed, we need to deal not only with the symptoms but also with the causes. And this presupposes mobilising resources in many and varied sectors, in the economic, social and development as well as the political sector.
Finally, the transatlantic legislative dialogue is an exceptionally important element in transatlantic relations.
Whereas the Council's contacts are to a great extent with the government of the United States, Parliament can play a vital role by reinforcing its dialogue with the members of Congress, in the aim of promoting an understanding of the concerns and priorities of the peoples of the European Union.
The Council is not authorised to dictate to civil society the role which it can play in this dialogue.
However, it has encouraged the development of the four specialist dialogues and maintains the view that, together with the numerous networks of universities, institutes, laboratories, ideas and so on, they can make an important contribution.
No more cooperation frameworks are needed.
What is needed in the dialogue with the United States is for each side to be carefully informed of the other side's opinions and mutual action.
. Madam President, there are a number of interesting questions framed by Mr Brok which hint at concerns we should try to address about the good health of our current dialogue with the United States.
Those on both sides of the Atlantic who are already engaged in the intensive preparations for next month's EU-US summit to which the Presidency referred and in finalising an impressive list of deliverables, should, I believe, be able to reassure the honourable Member.
That we are emerging from a period of strain in the transatlantic relationship is not in dispute.
In some respects it would have been a matter for greater concern if the trauma of a war had not prompted such a heartfelt debate.
Nor do I doubt that some of the problems thrown into relief by the war in Iraq have deeper roots.
I have spoken in this place and elsewhere of longer-term trends in some circles in the United States which are properly a cause of concern to Europeans.
Above all we must encourage political leaders and public opinion in the United States to resist those who argue in favour of overturning 50 years of American internationalism and multilateralism in pursuit of an illusory sense of security.
Whatever their motivation, those in the United States who reject multilateralism must know that such an approach contains a depressing element of self-fulfilling prophecy.
Multilateralism without the US may well fail.
But those of us who advocate multilateralism also bear a responsibility: to ensure that it produces practical, effective and timely results.
This is an important debate.
But it must not overshadow the realities of transatlantic ties which are, in many crucial respects, broadening and deepening.
Having dialogue does not necessarily imply that we always agree, or that we agree on everything.
But we agree to manage our differences and to continue the dialogue.
We disagree on the Kyoto Protocol, but will still work together on carbon sequestration and soon on hydrogen research.
We threaten the United States with FSC retaliatory measures and they take us to the WTO because they think that we are too slow in approving new genetically-modified products.
But Europe and the US remain the largest trading partners in the world, and conflicts account for only a fraction of our total trade.
Three quarters of all foreign direct investment in United States is European, half of America's foreign direct investment is in Europe.
Europe invests more in Texas than America invests in Japan; American investments in the Netherlands are about twice the figure for American investments in Mexico.
Of course our dialogue with the United States reaches far beyond the Commission's traditional domain of trade and economic relations.
In the aftermath of September 11th 2001, we have made significant progress in police cooperation and in tackling sources of funding for terrorists.
Soon we will finalise agreements on mutual legal assistance and on extradition.
We are working closely with the US on a range of issues concerning transport security.
And, building on the experience of EU-US cooperation in the Balkans, we are already working together on the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
Now that the UN has established a political framework for Iraq in the post-Saddam period, we hope soon to be in a position to assess how we can contribute there.
Regarding the transatlantic economic partnership, a framework for a close economic relationship was agreed at the Summit in London in 1998.
We have an Action Plan incorporating a range of initiatives including technical barriers to trade, procurement, mutual recognition, intellectual property and competition.
In multilateral fora we have co-operated closely in efforts to drive forward the Doha Development Agenda.
Bilaterally, we have progressed on mutual recognition and on the new Positive Economic Agenda agreed last year.
In support of the government dialogue both Europe and United States have recently reconfirmed their commitment to the Transatlantic Business Dialogue in a more focused format.
Turning to the point on different economic models, we do not see the differences between NAFTA and the FTAA, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other, as obstacles to a closer transatlantic economic relationship.
Rather we see them as different paths towards a common destination: greater global economic integration.
The regional convergence of collective preferences can be addressed in the multilateral context in a fair and constructive way, but also in bilateral terms, notably by focusing on the identification of sectoral and mutually beneficial initiatives that have a direct positive impact on business and market conditions.
Turning to the question of global challenges, for example, the environment, justice, migration, social and ethnic conflicts, clearly the report card on our co-operation is mixed.
We have made a great deal of progress on justice; we have less of a meeting of minds on environmental targets.
In the realm of development assistance strategies, both Europe and the United States are committed to the new global partnership for development.
We will work together in seeking to integrate developing countries into the world economy .
In all these respects we are committed to the principle of complementarity and ensuring the most efficient and effective use of donor funds in development programmes.
In the humanitarian field, we are also firmly committed to work towards greater effectiveness and complementarity of efforts, and our own agencies and American agencies work well together in order to try to accomplish this.
Finally, with regard to the proposal for a report on future transatlantic relations, the House may recall that I addressed this issue perhaps a shade argumentatively in a speech to this assembly a year ago.
As I said then, I do not believe that the problems we face derive from a lack of strategy.
The goals and vision for our relationship, as expressed in the 1995 New Transatlantic Agenda, are still valid.
Given the stormy waters we have traversed since then I understand the desire of some to review our course.
But, it is precisely because we are still recovering from the rigours of this crossing that we should take a little time to steady ourselves and ensure that any new long-term strategy is not misdirected by the emotions and pressures of the short term.
This is all the more true at a time when the European Union is engaged in a fundamental review of its own purpose and structures - including a new European Security Strategy - and the US is heading towards the early stages of a presidential election campaign.
In these circumstances there is every risk that any such review would be characterised, at least by those outside it, as further evidence of the alleged 'crisis' in European Union-United States relations.
Instead we need to focus on the resolution of practical problems, whilst engaging in a more low-key dialogue with our American counterparts, preferably face-to-face rather than through the loudspeakers of our respective media.
The role of the European Parliament will be essential in this regard.
Of course we look to work with you to generate new ideas on the transatlantic relationship, and I hope Parliament itself will use its independence and wisdom to challenge us with some of the themes which should be included in a future strategy.
We also look to the experience that you and your constituents bring to bear on the policies formulated in Brussels.
Above all we need you to engage with your counterparts in Congress to ensure that the European case is given full weight in the intellectual and legislative debates in Washington.
There are just two points I would like to make in addition as a brief footnote.
First of all the House has probably heard me say before that there is very little that we want to achieve in Europe which we are not more likely to achieve if we can work in cooperation with the United States.
It is almost equally the case that many, if not most, of the things that the United States wants to achieve are more likely to be achievable if the United States can work with Europe.
That was a point made both explicitly and implicitly in the recent American security strategy.
A partnership is different from rivalry.
Equally, partners are entitled to have opinions of their own.
We should not feel under any obligation to find out from Washington what our opinions as Europeans should be before we express them.
So I very much hope that we will give one another, from time to time, the benefit of the doubt and will recognise that the world and we ourselves are better off if America and Europe are able to work in partnership.
One final point: I suppose it is possible to frame a view of relations for the future in terms of the solidarity that we enjoyed in the years after the Second World War, when Europe, principally, pressed for the security structures which led to the establishment of Nato and when America pressed for the economic and political integration which led to the establishment of the Common Market and eventually to the European Union.
It is folly not to recognise how much changed geostrategically with the end of the Cold War and with the collapse of the Berlin Wall.
I hope that in developing a relationship for the future, we will base it on today's realities and future realities, not on the warm after-glow of a remarkably successful partnership in the second half of the last century.
If we can do as well as that again we will be extremely fortunate.
But if we are to do as well as that, we have to look at the problems of the future through the prism of today's challenges and not through the prism of yesterday's successes.
Madam President, this is an excellent occasion to have a discussion on the transatlantic partnership, now that the Iraq conflict is over and the dust is settling in the desert and before the Council and Commission head to Washington at the end of this month.
It seems to my group that whereas in the 1980s the security partnership underpinned the transatlantic relationship and we had economic differences, now the economic market and integration on trade and investment are underpinning the transatlantic relationship, while the security side is looking somewhat fragile.
Yet, for reasons which they both express clearly, the Council and Commission today see everything in the reasonably short term, rather than providing a longer-term vision of our relationship with the United States.
An American diplomat expressed this nicely a few days ago: he said that we, in Europe, are looking at problems from a 2003 perspective: the problems of building the European Union, our foreign policy and the beginnings of an external strategy.
The United States, on the other hand, is looking much more to the problems of 2020, with the weapons of mass destruction and a whole range of other things, on a global basis, which we tend not to do.
The message which should be sent to the summit is therefore that politics, economics and security policy in the post-Cold War world are all beginning to be closely intertwined.
Firstly, as regards politics.
Yes, we need to understand each other, as the Council President has said, but surely we need more collaboration, not just in particular instances, such as the war against terrorism: we need a long-term framework to get to grips with that problem and shift the emphasis from a Community of values to a Community of action, dealing with problems of AIDS in the Third World, nuclear proliferation and a range of other things which Europe and America face jointly as global challenges.
Secondly, in economics.
We know, as the Commissioner has said, that global economic challenges bring us closer together, but surely it is by developing closer linkages, by developing a transatlantic market - much of that is already in place, but we need to add on financial services, the digital economy, competition policy and other things - that we can complete a transatlantic market over the next decade.
Thirdly, in security policy, where we have the greatest difficulty, we have to ask the questions: will Europe have the military capability?
Does it have the political will ever to emerge as a partner with the United States?
In concluding, it seems to me that we need a long-term European strategy to know what we want before we can shape a transatlantic strategy and think on similar terms with the Americans.
Secondly, we need a transatlantic summit which takes a strategic view, rather than looking at particular instances and particular problems.
Finally, the big idea is this transatlantic market where we need to mobilise our business and political communities and listen to those we represent so that we can shape the world of tomorrow to our mutual benefit.
Madam President, our concern about the current state of transatlantic relations does not stem solely from the vicissitudes of the Iraq crisis or its possible consequences, but from deeper causes, and essentially the realisation that we are seeing a truly radical change, a truly extraordinary change in the United States' foreign and security policy, under the neo-conservative banner.
Leadership by means of multinational cooperation has been replaced by a global unilateralist approach, the strategies of containment and dissuasion by the doctrine of pre-emptive attack and the restrictions imposed by participation in alliances and multilateral institutions by the creation of made-to-measure coalitions in which a form of subordination based on the notion that 'you are either with me or against me' tend to predominate.
Many of us in Europe believe that this way of thinking, rather than producing a Pax Americana, may actually produce significant American chaos in the world.
Within this context, if Europe wishes to meet its responsibilities it must turn itself into an organisation capable of playing a significant role on the international stage and, in order to achieve this, European policy must permanently pursue the objective of multilateralising the United States - an objective which is not entirely out of reach if we consider that opinion polls indicate that almost two-thirds of the American public prefer multilateral approaches to unilateral ones.
Within a renewed relationship we must accept clearly that there are significant discrepancies, that there are many differences of perception and approach but there are also many shared views and potential points of agreement.
If we accept this contrasting situation we will be able to make progress.
I would finally like to say that I believe that positions expressed by the High Representative and Commissioner Patten, as well as the specific proposals presented by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, are aimed in the right direction and we will support them.
I would urge you not to let a reunified Europe become divided over Atlantic unity.
Commissioner Patten is right.
The most pressing world problems cannot, and should not, be solved by the United States alone.
Whether these problems concern weapons of mass destruction, human rights, poverty, religious conflicts or lack of democracy, it is vitally important for America and Europe to join forces.
Europeans must join Bush in showing the West's neo-progressive face to the world.
The European Union can be Washington's fully-fledged partner only if it acts like one.
If the French-German axis turns away from Washington, while the British-Polish axis moves towards Bush, we will end up not making any headway at all.
We must put the trauma of Iraq to one side and, as the European Union, draft a joint global strategy with the United States.
Two strategies are too many, and there is no room for either inflated national egos or conservative ideological agendas.
Let us now reunite Europe and America using a pragmatic approach, in other words the D'66 approach.
Madam President, I would firstly like to thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission for their speeches, and point out that when our delegation of MEPs visited Washington, Members of the US Congress asked us for help in neutralising and paralysing the neo-conservative and, in some ways, almost fascist, tendencies of the Bush administration.
In other words, they expressed their desire for a relationship between the US and European people which contributes to peace in the world.
If it is shown that the US State Department was providing misinformation when it said that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq - and we are seeing that this was merely a manipulation - and if we remember that in the document from that Department of 20 September 2002, the UN, the European Union and international law were dispensed with and it is stated simply that the United States are going to dictate laws in the future, I believe we are facing a great threat to the world and also to Europe.
Fortunately, Europe is based on peace, international law and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and must play a major role in order to make progress in that direction and prevent the new threats of this conservative Bush administration, thereby restoring the friendship between the American people and ourselves.
Madam President, I was not aware that idealism was the dominant philosophy in the European Parliament.
We cannot build transatlantic relations just by repeating over and over again that that is what we want.
In the past, transatlantic relations were determined by the stand-off between the totalitarian regimes of communist countries on the one hand and the West on the other. This was the point made by Mr Patten towards the end of his speech.
This situation changed following the fall of Communism.
If, therefore, we want to have transatlantic relations, we need to redefine the relationship. We need to ask ourselves whether the United States and Europe are bound to have the same interests nowadays.
Prior to the fall of Communism, that had to be the case, but is this still true today? Having formulated the question the answer becomes obvious.
The United States and Europe do not now share the same vision or the same interests. This is true both in terms of geo-strategy and in terms of economics.
A new transatlantic relationship cannot therefore be built by repeatedly expressing our desire for it. We need to come up with a completely new definition of our relations with the United States.
Let us take a very simple example.
We now have the euro.
If we are honest, the euro divides the European Union from the United States, as the euro is the dollar's main rival. Therefore, our strategic and economic interests differ.
If we want to reinvigorate our economies and re-launch Europe, we need to pose a question that is of fundamental importance for Europe. At a global level, we must ask whether we are bound forever to pay for energy and oil in dollars.
Where is it decreed that we must pay in dollars for the oil and gas we buy from Russia, Saudi Arabia or Iran?
We must have the will in terms of strategy and economic policy to make the euro a safe currency to ensure we have the funds to bring about economic recovery. The United States is doing just this today.
A figure of USD 8 billion per day has been quoted.
The US needs investment to pay off its debts. We therefore need to strengthen the role of the euro as a safe currency that rivals the dollar.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to discuss the subject of transatlantic relations, you must find the courage to put this problem to the United States.
The real stakes are these.
We will not succeed in building a new transatlantic relationship if we in the European Union do not have our own doctrine on all the strategic problems, on all the military problems, on our vision of the world and on what we want in the world.
We need to ensure that we define our interests. Only then can we enter into discussions with the United States.
Madam President, the war in Iraq recently exposed clear political divisions between many EU leaders and the US Government, but we should reflect for a moment and ask ourselves the following question. Do we want to renew a transatlantic partnership or do we believe that it is in the best interests of the European Union to distance ourselves from the US Government at this time?
If a renewed transatlantic partnership is desirable it is certainly not going to be easy to achieve because of the ongoing differences between many EU governments and the present US administration.
However, I believe that our common interests and concerns are best served by the European Union and the US Government working more closely together on a wide-ranging set of issues.
We should not forget that over the last 50 years we have worked together to fashion an international legal order covering not just trade and security issues, but also issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms.
It is equally important that the high emotions that exist at this time do not cause us to exaggerate our differences across a range of policy matters.
We should seek to address the relationship between the European Union and the USA by taking a careful and measured approach, rather than dealing with this very important relationship in a knee-jerk fashion.
The bottom line is simply this: I believe that the Union and the USA should work together to preserve our common interests, to minimise our collective differences, to maximise our own influence for good in the world.
For example, our collective economies are only achieving moderate success at this particular time.
One of the ways in which we can help to revive our economies is to ensure that the present deadlock in trade negotiations is broken.
We must guarantee that the forthcoming World Trade Organisation talks, which will take place in September, are a real success.
We must advance a positive agenda on trade matters and resolve disputes before they go to the WTO process.
We should also recall that we have worked very closely together in the battle against international terrorism.
Issues that we have addressed together range from improving security in airlines to the issue of mutual extradition agreements.
We are working closely together in the Balkans and Afghanistan.
In Afghanistan the European Union has a bigger military presence than the United States.
The EU is the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.
The Middle East process has a better chance of success if the European Union and the United States work together with all the key contracting parties in the region so as to ensure that the present road map for peace guarantees both Israeli and Palestinian statehood and security in the region.
Madam President, I think of partnership as a strong mutual bond, one in which the key elements are mutual trust and close cooperation based on common values and objectives.
Regrettably, it is precisely these elements that have been absent from the transatlantic partnership over the past few months.
The most painful manifestation of transatlantic, and at the same time European, discord was the public controversy over Iraq.
We on this side of the Atlantic Ocean have all the more reason to first search our own hearts.
In short, how should we take the transatlantic partnership further?
It is primarily the global safety situation that jumps out at you.
Terrorism - of whatever ideological or religious hue - calls for a joint transatlantic approach.
In concrete terms, destabilising forces in the Middle East may not play the European Union off against either one another or against the United States.
The West's coordinated fight against terrorism makes association agreements and trade agreements with states from that region worthy of condemnation.
Do the Council and the Commission share this vision?
After all, Syria and Iran are on the agenda; is that not so, Commissioner Patten?
There is a great deal at stake: the European Union's political credibility - including in the eyes of my electorate - and the solidity and durability of the transatlantic partnership.
Militarily speaking, the European Union is now clearly the weaker partner in the transatlantic alliance.
What is more obvious than a more substantial input from the Member States within NATO?
This would promote the transatlantic partnership.
European military alternatives, on the other hand, would erode the crucial bond of safety with the United States.
Moreover, I cannot see any reason why we should have faith in initiatives of that kind.
Let us in Europe be realistic and, above all, be reliable friends and real allies to the Americans.
Madam President, almost a hundred years of history shows us Europeans that whenever our continent has been in trouble the United States of America has always come to our rescue.
In the First World War that became the deciding factor in preventing the expansion of imperial Germany.
In the Second World War the US contribution was decisive in delivering Germany and France from Hitler's yoke and the rest of Europe from his aspirations to power.
When the Cold War ended in the break-up of the Soviet Union and the liberation of countries that had been under the yoke of Central European communism and the Soviet Union it was decidedly the result of President Ronald Reagan's arms race, which the Soviet economy and its social system could not bear.
When we say today that relations between the United States and Europe have reached a crisis it is more about a crisis in Europe's internal relations and a crisis in relations between certain individual countries and the United States.
The way certain countries go in for unilateralism in EU internal affairs shows we are still light years away from a common foreign and security policy in crisis situations.
Most of the 25 European countries supported the approval of the UN Security Council regarding starting a war with Iraq.
Most do not accept America's insistence on being able to take up a position outside the international organisation in matters of war crimes.
We disagree over the importance of the Kyoto Agreement and each day there are talks to resolve differences of opinion on economic matters.
All this notwithstanding, the basic values we tend to share and considerations of security common to us both, where Europe is becoming more and more the recipient than the provider, are a firm basis for looking to the future and supporting the transatlantic partnership and genuinely constructing the kind of action programme that my colleague, James Elles, just mentioned.
We in Europe can no longer catch up with the United States in the area of defence technology; and perhaps we do not need to.
We can and must, however, resolve our differences and aspire to a common foreign and defence policy.
Only in this way will we be a worthy partner in matters that unite us and in those we disagree with the United States over, a partner that is sufficiently strong for our views to be heeded in the United States, whose largest trading partner we are, as we heard concerning US investment in Europe.
That shows that for the United States the positive development of our relationship is important, but for us it is vital.
We can accept the boycott on French wines in America if as a counterweight America places an order for a hundred Airbus planes, as was the case just a week or so ago.
Madam President, I think that everyone will agree that there is a need for a serious debate within the European Union, but also between the European Union and the United States, about the role of the security policy in transatlantic relations.
However, for that to happen, a better foundation is required at this side of the ocean.
Above all, we need to try to establish what we ourselves want and not get bogged down so much by what we do not want the Americans to do.
I think that this will be a very decisive factor indeed in future.
If we in the European Union want to leave our own mark on this discussion, we will once again need to define together what is essential to us.
I hope that the strategy that Mr Solana will shortly be tabling will make a significant contribution to this.
The European Union itself must be able, and have the courage, to take more responsibility.
This can be done most effectively by continuing to build on our own defence identity in a dynamic manner, but also by carrying out security tasks independently, in - for example - Macedonia, and soon in Africa too.
We must learn to make more efficient use of our defence capabilities, but not avoid a possible discussion about higher defence outgoings.
The EU must be committed to a wide range of security, conflict prevention being its key priority.
Experience in this field and the instruments that the European Union has at its disposal must be better coordinated and used more effectively.
Involvement in multilateral frameworks, such as the United Nations, forms part of this.
Security is sustainable only if it is founded on international cooperation.
This is the core message, I think, to the Americans, who go all out for their country's military power.
NATO can play a bridging role, but only if the opinion which many Europeans have about security is done justice.
We want political equality in transatlantic relations, but there is little point in asking for it if we remain divided ourselves.
Madam President, just hours after the Evian G8 meeting, which a growing number of citizens see as illegitimate, I feel it is essential to come up with answers to a number of questions, before attempting to consider the nature of the transatlantic partnership.
As I do not have a great deal of time, I will only touch on some of these questions.
First, there is the question of Iraq.
Can we really say that the issue of the war has been dealt with when the European Union has given its blessing to the United States having complete control of Iraq?
Should we engage in a war against terrorism instigated by the bellicose stance of the United States that seeks to dominate, not to share power? This is just increasing the threat.
Should we then allow ourselves to be engulfed in a genuine currency war, started this time by the United States?
Should we give in to President Bush's decrees yet again by setting aside what remains of the European social model? Should we set aside the provisions on retirement, for example, in the face of wholesale opposition as exemplified by the large demonstrations in France and Austria?
Lastly, what use will the meeting of the WTO in Cancun be if the European Union does not stand up to the United States' continuing failure to move on certain issues, especially that of allowing poor countries to access generic medicines?
The European Union is at a crossroads.
It may choose to hide behind the strategic doctrine entitled 'for a new American century'. Alternatively it may choose to adopt a truly independent policy.
If we choose the latter, how can we achieve such a policy without addressing the huge expectations of the southern hemisphere and without freeing ourselves from the ultraliberal policy that exacerbates inequalities and frustrates all attempts to promote development? We must listen to the people of Europe.
They do not want Europe to be a poor relation of the United States. They do not want Europe to be overcautious.
They are hoping and praying for an independent and responsible Europe. They long for a Europe that promotes the interests of all in working for a world that is safer because it is more humane.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, this debate must allow us to reflect on our foreign policy relations, and therefore our economic relations too, with NAFTA and, in particular, with the United States and in the context of transatlantic relations.
With regard to the famous CFSP, I hope and believe that the Convention will resolve the political gap, appointing a Minister for External Affairs and avoiding losses of international credibility such as that which we have suffered as a result of the Iraq crisis.
With regard to the economic sector, however, I think the best solution is not so much to intervene via any WTO agreements as to draw up a single list which addresses the issues in terms of tax and trade concessions, for that will allow us to avoid further instances of bureaucratic chaos.
Otherwise, I cannot see us achieving anything.
The so-called partnership agreements relating to what is our primary market in terms of both investment and trade will play a major role if we are able to reinvigorate them, simplifying the issue by compiling a list, an agreement that could be concluded by the Commission with NAFTA, first and foremost.
On the eve of enlargement, I believe this is a significant way of boosting our economy and the political content of our foreign policy.
Madam President, I wish to begin by saying how much I welcome this debate and I congratulate the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on its initiative.
We have an opportunity after the recent events to rebuild and improve the transatlantic relationship - that has to be the challenge we take on board.
The summit at the end of this month will give us the opportunity - which we should grasp - to begin building that new future.
We cannot allow the past to overshadow the future.
However, we have to realise that dialogue must involve both sides of the Atlantic.
My experience in the last 12 months has been that the United States has not been engaged or focused and, to some extent, we must make it understand how Europe operates and works at this moment.
The legislative dialogue must be restarted.
We almost had it, and the US pulled out at the last moment.
However, I will not give up on that particular point.
We must have an early-warning system in place to pinpoint areas of potential disagreement at the earliest possible moment.
To achieve this we will require radical rethinking of how we have conducted our relations to date within the Commission and Parliament.
I will use the meeting at the end of the month between Congress and the Members of this Parliament to further promote the dialogue and ensure that we can restart it.
There is no point using excellent fine words that we put on paper if we do not have the follow-through on both sides of the Atlantic and if we do not deliver.
That is the important point.
Finally, we all have to take responsibility for what has happened and to shoulder a little of the blame.
This Parliament has a central role to play in this and must take on board its responsibilities, but the Council and the Commission must give us greater cooperation.
Madam President, Commissioner, as has already been said, I believe it is desirable for Europe and the United States to work together in partnership.
It stands to reason.
All this rhetoric about partnership should not mean, however, that we evade the choices Europe has to make and the difficulty we are faced with at present.
Contrary to what some honourable Members have said, we in Europe are not responsible for the erosion of the type of historic links we have with the United States.
We are having to deal with a very particular type of administration.
It was extremely unilateralist from the outset.
Initially, however, it did not adopt a particularly interventionist line. One section of the administration used the trauma of 11 September to impose its own unilateralist and extremely interventionist agenda which predated those terrible events.
Faced with this situation, Europe has a decision to make.
On the one hand, it could be argued that nothing can be done to counter the will of the United States, given the power it has on the world stage.
In that case, there would be nothing to do except to give in to the United States and to go along with them, even when it comes to lies and exposing ourselves to ridicule, just like those who tried to make us believe that intervening in Iraq was justified because weapons of mass destruction posed an imminent threat.
If we were to go down that road, Mr Elles' proposal would make sense. It amounts to a free trade zone or in other words a new version of the Transatlantic Market Place.
We must, however, bear in mind that this would mean setting aside the Union's common external trade policy.
The creation of this huge market would amount to the United States annexing the European Economic Area.
Decisions would be taken in Washington.
The United States would not be willing to allow Europe to have its say in decision-making on this issue.
On the other hand, we could take the view that Europe has things to say on the world stage and a vision to promote of a world order based on the rule of law. This vision would entail fairer relations between the North and the South.
In our view this is important if we are to create a world order that offers everyone greater security. If this is what we want to do, this is not the time to toe the line.
It is the time to promote a common foreign and defence policy. There is a paradox here in that Mr Elles said we need to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy while at the same time suggesting we make certain concessions to the United States.
In my opinion, if we believe we should promote the statute of Rome and an International Criminal Court, if we believe that we should argue for the Kyoto agreements, the non-proliferation treaty and the end of atomic testing, we must assert our independence. Relations between the European Union and the United States must be rebuilt on the basis of this independence.
Our American friends will have to accept this.
The current US administration will not last forever and I believe that our friendship will win out in the end.
Madam President, I should like to challenge three assumptions in the questions that have been put to the Council and the Commission.
First, France and Germany are not the European Union.
They certainly do not speak for Europe.
It is not accurate or helpful, therefore, to describe their difficulties with the USA as a transatlantic rift between the EU and the United States.
Secondly, it is not at all healthy for the European Union to construct itself as Europe's interlocutor with the USA on defence and security matters.
There is already a forum through which European nations address transatlantic security matters - that is called Nato.
Thirdly, the idea that the European security and defence policy has anything whatsoever to do with reinforcing Nato is, at best, disingenuous and at worst a political deceit.
ESDP is not about sharing the defence burden, it is not about strengthening the European pillar of Nato.
It is about adding to European Union competences, taking forward the political ambition of European integration and empowerment.
It adds no additional military capabilities.
It merely establishes a different planning and decision-making regime that specifically excludes the Americans.
When the leaders of the European countries sit down with the Americans and other allies there is a remarkable unanimity.
We have seen this in the last few days at Evian with the G8 and at the Nato ministerial meeting in Madrid.
This is not unilateralism.
Yet when the same European leaders come together in an EU context some strange mental transformation takes place and they seem to speak an altogether different language.
We should be reinforcing transatlantic solidarity, developing our joint capacities to tackle terrorism, to deal with the WMD threat and to deploy capable military forces wherever they might be needed.
Given the dangers that we all face I cannot understand why the European governments imagine that there is any advantage in discussing security and defence in a separate room to the Americans.
Partnership of the European nations with the United States requires not just improved capabilities but also political will.
This is sadly lacking at the moment.
The greatest service that could be done to Western security and transatlantic relations would be to draw back ESDP under the Nato umbrella and for us all to work together in solidarity for common ends.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 19 June 2003.
The next item is a statement by the Commission on elections in Nigeria.
. Madam President, as Parliament knows, Nigeria went through an important test of its stability and of its democratic development in the election cycle of April and May.
We in the European Commission supported these elections through an assistance programme of EUR 6.5 million which went to the Independent National Election Commission, directed at the education of voters and which supported domestic observation organisations.
At the same time we deployed an Election Observation Mission.
The mission has concluded its operation in Nigeria and I am delighted that Mr van den Berg will be able to present his findings to Parliament here today.
I thanked the chief observer in a press statement I made on 5 May 2003.
I am glad to repeat here today what I said in that statement.
The head of the mission and his team did an extremely professional job.
We thank the honourable Member and his colleagues for the dedicated way in which they completed this exceptionally difficult task.
I would also like to thank Mrs Junker, who represented the European Parliament delegation.
The Election Observation Mission dealt formidably with the challenges of a long deployment, the challenges of working in a large and complex country, and the challenge as well of dealing with three difficult election days.
The elections did not trigger the widespread violence which had been feared by many.
I shall say straightaway that this was a relief to all of us and is the best news to come out of these election campaigns.
The absence of violence is a necessary, but not, as the philosophers might put it, a sufficient condition for democratic elections.
What the European Union Election Observation Mission saw was, as Parliament will know, disappointing.
There was serious fraud in many states, there were various irregularities in others and overall there were systemic problems like unreliable voters' registers, a lack of secrecy and insufficient safeguards against double voting.
Those were some of the sad features of these elections.
The reactions of the government and the national election commission have likewise been disappointing.
Instead of verifying and addressing shortcomings, they criticised our Election Observation Mission.
They did not question reported facts, but rather said they were questioning the mission's cultural understanding of those facts.
Explaining electoral fraud as the result of cultural differences seems both far-fetched and self-defeating.
Furthermore, it has been proved on other occasions that, despite problems, relatively transparent elections can be held in Africa.
We saw that, for example, in Kenya last December.
It is important to note that the findings of domestic observer groups, which had deployed almost 50 000 observers covering one third of all polling stations, were very similar to those of the European Union's Election Observation Mission.
We note that President Obasanjo - who was sworn in on 29 May 2003 - and his party have greatly strengthened their electoral position in the country.
While the President remains an important partner for us, we will have to keep an eye on the development of pluralism in Nigeria's democracy.
I would like to say one other thing.
The Election Observation Missions that we support, invariably under the leadership of Members of this House, are one of the most important ways in which we provide practical assistance for the development and strengthening of democracy around the world.
They are one of the most practical ways in which we improve governance, not least in poorer developing countries.
But it is imperative that the integrity of the process and of what we are trying to do is maintained.
I decline to take the view that we should hedge the conclusions of our Election Observation Missions around with political considerations.
Once we are seen to be politicising this process, it will cease to carry any weight and frankly will cease to be the valuable instrument it is at the moment for the development and enhancement of democracy.
However convenient it may seem to some to bowdlerise the conclusions of missions, however inconvenient it may seem to some to tell the truth about what experienced observers have seen on the ground, we have to be absolutely clear on every occasion that our Election Observation Missions have the job of telling it as it is.
We have as good a record as anyone in this area and I would not want to see us detract from that by one centimetre.
Once again I would like to pay a tribute to the honourable Member and to all those who worked with him.
They have done an outstanding job and I hope that the House will continue to provide equally effective heads for these missions in the years ahead.
Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the Commission for responding to this resolution on Nigeria and also Mr van den Berg both for his reports and for the enormous amount of work he did as chief observer while he was in Nigeria.
His report is factual, fair and frank, and I find it disappointing that the Council report - perhaps for obvious reasons - was not as strong in its comments.
In future I hope that the institutions will try and speak with one voice.
As the Commissioner has just said, we have to be outspoken and condemn wrongdoings or there is no point in observing.
The Nigerian elections were a classic example of how important election observation by the EU institutions is and how important it is to have observers out in the polling stations.
The sight of observers not only ensures that misdemeanours are spotted, it also encourages voters that the outside world is taking an interest in making sure that rules are observed and democracy and freedom of choice are being given a chance.
I have always believed that it is difficult to transpose a European-style election procedure onto some developing countries, as they do not have the capacity to properly prepare the paperwork.
It is in this area that we in Europe could help by increasing our support to strengthen procedures.
It is extremely disappointing that some regions showed such a blatant disregard for honesty and transparency, and these are well documented by the chief observer.
Action should be taken by the appropriate bodies to rectify such anomalies, and we here should continue to monitor what happens.
President Obasanjo has the potential to be one of the great leaders in the new Africa and should not be tarnished by the behaviour of some of his supporters.
Nigeria is one of the largest and, potentially, richest countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
With good governance, it can set an example not only for the region but also for the whole continent.
However, to do that it must set aside the ethnic differences of the north and south, outlaw the extremes of Sharia law and work together towards economic prosperity.
In the African Union and NEPAD Nigeria can take a leading role in building a regenerated Africa under the Cotonou Accord, so it is disappointing it did not set a better example at these elections.
There were blatant and obvious misdemeanours, both before and during the elections, but we must look ahead to the future, correcting the mistakes of the past - by legislation where necessary - and we must encourage it to do so.
The chief observer's report should point it in the right direction.
I sincerely hope Nigeria will take note and take action.
Madam President, I have the honour today of presenting the EU Observation Mission's final report on the elections in Nigeria, which is being handed out as I speak.
The report is very extensive and contains a lot of information and many recommendations.
There is far too much information to sum up in three minutes, but it is all in there for you to read up.
I would like to mention a few conclusions.
First of all, it is, I think, important to establish that the Nigerian population, and many of its socially active organisations, greatly value this modern instrument of external EU policy.
I am in total agreement with the Commissioner on this point.
It is an effective instrument to promote peace, stability and democracy.
The EU should be proud of this 'soft power'.
Secondly, the mission, invited by the Nigerian Government, was the longest and most extensive mission which the EU has ever accomplished.
I had the privilege of working with a very proficient core team, efficient departments in Brussels and with an enthusiastic observation team comprising over one hundred members.
The findings of our mission have been widely discussed, both worldwide and within Nigeria.
The main thing was that we identified the election fraud we discovered for what it actually was, rather than putting it into perspective or concealing it.
We did not mince our words.
This, quite simply, was what we owed to the Nigerian electorate.
Ultimately, we established extensive systematic fraud in six federal states during the governor and presidential elections on 19 April and we discovered serious shortcomings in another five federal states.
The same happened on 3 May, but then there were seven instead of six.
Our findings correspond to those of 10 000 national election observers.
Simply to call this fraud Nigerian fraud is unacceptable and an insult to the Nigerian population.
It is, in fact, evidence of the over-organisation of those in power and not of underdevelopment.
If we realise that about half of all the states have electoral problems, this brings into focus the significance of the legal cases which are now being brought before the specially instituted election tribunals.
It remains a very serious matter that meanwhile, the central and regional INEC - the election council - was unwilling, not allowed or unable, to do anything about the election fraud that was discovered.
It was, and still is, their task.
I would ask the Commissioner actively to promote the EU, via the local EU delegation - under the excellent leadership of Leonidas - with the backing of local lawyers' organisations, being given the opportunity of actively following these election tribunals - without any involvement of course, for that is not up to us - and to inform the Council and Parliament accordingly.
Finally, I should like to ask the Commission to reconsider its aid contract with Nigeria, which affects many states, in such a way - and I am not at all in favour of sanctions or similar action, for that would be wrong - that it becomes possible to shift, as it were, the resources for federal states which will not obtain a democratic structure or new elections - such as the federal state of Ogun - to civilian projects of democratic states.
May I finally say to the Council that its statement contravened the facts.
There was a low turnout and few women took part.
Results showing a high level of participation had simply been falsified.
The Council should have taken a more professional stance.
It should speak with one voice. This would really be more helpful than engaging in external foreign politics.
In connection with this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions submitted in accordance with Article 37.2 of the Rules of Procedure
The next item is Question Time (B5-0097/2003).
The following questions are addressed to the Council.
Mr Ortuondo has the floor for one minute for a point of order.
Mr President, I would like to refer to Articles 6 and 7 of the European Union Treaty, which indicate, respectively, that that Union is based on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the Rule of Law. And that, on the proposal of Parliament or the Commission, the Council can note the existence of a clear risk of serious violation of these principles on the part of a Member State.
All of this means, from a legal point of view, that the possible violation of freedoms and rights on the part of a State is the competence of the European institutions.
So I would like to vigorously condemn and protest against the anti democratic and illegal abuse I have received from Mr Pat Cox, President of Parliament, who has refused to include in this part-session two questions which I have presented in relation to two possible violations of the Rules of Law, of human rights and fundamental freedoms by Mr Aznar and his Spanish Government.
Firstly, because of an apparent lack of respect for the separation of powers, in view of his public statements telling the Spanish Supreme Court that it should agree to the annulment of 240 electoral candidatures which had been legally admitted by the ordinary electoral courts, and secondly for creating a law prohibiting Basque prisoners from studying and taking examinations at the Public University of the Basque Country, the only university that offers education in the Basque language, which may be a violation of the right to linguistic diversity.
Mr Ortuondo, you will note that you have the right here to raise a point of order which seems to me to be inappropriate given the issues you wish to raise during a Question Time; and I must point out to you that President Cox has decided to comply with the Rules of Procedure, and several paragraphs of the Rules, in relation to Question Time, make it very clear that questions must not contain statements or judgments, which in some cases are rash to say the least.
I will offer an example which is less dramatic than the one you have chosen to give today; as in football, we have Rules of Procedure; we must obey the Rules of Procedure, because otherwise we are caught off-side.
There are channels for raising everything you wish to raise, but in accordance with our democratically established Rules of Procedure.
You may respond, as you request, but please be very brief.
Mr President, I agree with what you say about the Rules of Procedure.
I believe I have obeyed them to the letter.
The President tells me that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Council, but Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty indicate that it falls within the competence of the Council and of Parliament.
That is why I put the question.
Secondly, I would like it to be noted that my questions did not contain statements of any type.
They are simply questions and the text is there to be read.
?he Council would remind the honourable Member that, although combating people trafficking is a very important issue to the European Union, it is not expressly mentioned in the declaration by the European Council on 16 April 2003.
In her question, the honourable Member touches on certain points on which the Council would comment as follows:
In its Athens declaration of 16 April 2003, the European Council reiterated the values on which the European Union is based and confirmed its intention to continue to defend fundamental human rights, both inside and outside the European Union.
The European Council specifically undertook to continue to fight against all types of discrimination, as can be seen from the work which is under way in connection with the fight against racism and xenophobia or even the trade in human organs.
The ratification of the additional protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime signed in Palermo in December 2000 is a matter of national sovereignty for the states which sign it.
The Council therefore invites the honourable Member to contact the relevant authorities directly.
The proposal for a Council directive on short-term residents' permits granted to victims of organised illegal immigration or people trafficking who are working with the competent authorities is the focus of the Council's attention.
The examination of the directive has commenced and work will continue in conjunction with the various priorities set by the European Council, and the resources available.
As for the final question, the Council would note that it is not competent to reply on the methods used by the national authorities of the Member States to repatriate persons who have fallen victim to this sort of trafficking.
I regret to say I find that a rather thin answer.
I am sorry if I made a mistake about the content of the 17 April conference but nonetheless, on many occasions, EU ministers in the Council have called for combating people-smuggling, people-trafficking and criminal gangs.
I was disappointed that the Minister was unable to answer most of my points, saying that this has nothing to do with the Council and is more a matter for Member States.
I would have thought that under Title VI of the EU Treaty - police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters - the Council could at least coordinate and give a fuller answer.
The motivation behind my question is the gap between rhetoric and reality.
It seems to be a low police priority in most Member States.
The problem is that these women are both victims and illegal immigrants, but most governments treat them principally as illegal immigrants only.
This misses two goals: giving them protection and catching the trafficking gangs.
Governments have to decide if they really want to catch the traffickers, or if they only want headlines about how many illegal immigrants they have deported.
Unless they make those choices they will never get to grips with the traffickers.
Despite the fact that there is no new question, I should like to point out that all the efforts being made at Council level and on the part of the European Commission to develop the policy to combat illegal immigration and organised crime either at a general level or in the case of specific countries, I refer to the Balkans and to other countries too, obviously also has as one of its basic reference points the phenomenon raised by the honourable Member.
Consequently, through these policies, the objective is precisely to combat these sorts of phenomena, which the Council also accepts are particularly problematic in Europe today and we must do what we can to combat them.
I very much support the thinking behind Mrs Ludford's question that these people are both victims and illegal migrants.
She asked about a coordinated policy of assisted returns.
The Council has competence here.
Will the President-in-Office and the Council be taking forward to the Thessaloniki Summit the idea of managed migration - mentioned in the Tampere Summit - i.e. a more coordinated and thought-through policy throughout the Member States, as was revealed in Mrs Ludford's question?
The Presidency has raised the question of the need to coordinate the Union's policies on illegal immigrants with asylum policy and the need for an integrated policy.
Decisions have been taken one step at a time over recent months, as they were during the previous Presidency.
This is a new policy area for the Union.
We support it and we hope that the issues relating to this phenomenon will also be dealt with efficiently by successive Presidencies.
Mr President, I would ask you to grant me the minute of patience I require to explain my position in accordance with the Rules of Procedure.
Today's agenda contains a question by Mr SacrÃ©deus - which I support - on the violation of human rights in Cuba.
It is clear that taking measures to free the political prisoners in Cuba does not fall within the competence of the Council.
That is clear, but this question has been allowed.
However, I firstly presented a question on the deaths of protesters caused by US troops in Iraq - thirteen deaths in an Iraqi town - and I was told it contained value judgments.
I amended the question, in order to remove the value judgments, and once again I am told that it is not admissible, because I asked whether the Council was concerned about the death of protesters, particularly in view of the fact that the US troops are supported by Member States of the European Union.
I am wondering why a question on Iraq is not admissible but a question on Cuba is - although I consider that question to be legitimate since it is a universal issue.
Mr President, it seems to me - because this is not the first time this has happened - that there is censorship on Iraq, which is unacceptable.
In any event, I demand a reply, because I am finding it impossible to raise universal problems in this House which affect us directly.
In any event, I would like to ask you to explain why this discrimination has taken place, Mr President.
Mr Nogueira, the President for the sitting does not make any judgment and does not enter into a debate on the questions put by the honourable Members and admitted according to procedure; I am not therefore going to compare your question, which does not appear on the agenda, with the question by Mr SacrÃ©deus.
The President of Parliament has taken a decision, you have written to him, you have spoken in plenary about this issue, you have received a reply and you can contact the President of Parliament if you believe it appropriate to do so.
Iraq has been discussed thoroughly in this Chamber, you refer to the issue; it has been discussed without any censorship; there has naturally been complete freedom of expression for all political groups and Members in the presence of the Council and the Commission, and I would ask you not to turn a point of order into a point of disorder.
You have said what you believed should be said, you have expressed your view and your words will be recorded in the Minutes.
Please now allow the Members asking questions to put them.
This is not a debate about which questions are admitted and which are not. It is a debate on the questions which are on the agenda.
You have 15 seconds to say your final word.
I would firstly like to ask you to communicate my comments to the President of Parliament and secondly I spoke about the second reply, which is new, and which is for this sitting.
It is not the previous one, it is a new one, they have rejected a modified question for the second time.
In any event, I would ask you to communicate my comments to the President of Parliament in their entirety so that he may act accordingly, because I do not wish to create any disorder here.
I defend the Members' legitimate right to deal with the problems affecting them and, in any event, affecting humanity.
The President will be aware of your words from the most worthy source: from the Minutes.
I will not act as messenger; he will know the Minutes and will know exactly what you have said, just as he knows his letters.
Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0292/03):
Subject: Network for epidemiological surveillance
Decision 2119/98/EC
The Extraordinary Council on Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs held on 6 May 2003 approved conclusions in which, having carefully examined the situation regarding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, both inside the European Union and world-wide, and the different measures taken to address it, confirmed the importance of a quick assessment of the situation and review of future action.
The Council considers that the network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community has provided a very effective basis for the rapid exchange of information within the EU and for a coordinated response, in which the acceding countries have fully participated.
The Council recalled that the application of health protection measures falls to the authorities of the Member States, and confirmed the benefits of effective coordination of such measures through the epidemiological surveillance Network Committee.
It also endorses the orientations for immediate and future actions agreed on 10 April by the epidemiological surveillance Network Committee, which are summarised as follows:
rapid detection of all suspect cases of SARS through good surveillance;
protection of those at risk of infection from the cases through effective isolation of SARS patients in hospitals, including measures to protect carers;
particular attention to be paid to air travel, which has been an important factor in the spread of SARS, notably through standardised screening of passengers leaving affected areas, onboard advice to passengers and effective information at ports of entry from affected areas and
the particular importance of raising awareness among professionals and the public and the timely and accurate reporting and sharing of information with other countries, in particular the ?EA/?FTA countries, acceding and candidate countries and with the WHO.
Cooperation should also be developed with other partners, such as airline companies.
The Council urges the Member States and the acceding countries to implement effectively the orientations for immediate and future actions by the Network Committee and contribute actively to setting up a specific expert group on SARS under the Network Committee to develop common modalities and advice on health measures across Europe.
The Council underlined the need for continued cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and the WHO and called on the Member States to ensure, inter alia:
prompt and effective identification of all suspect and probable SARS cases, and their appropriate isolation in hospitals;
appropriate protection of hospital personnel treating the patients;
provision of guidance and information to health care workers and the public;
measures, consistent throughout the European Union, to provide and acquire information and traceabilty of international travellers arriving or in transit from affected areas;
timely and accurate reporting and sharing information with the Commission, WHO, other countries and other partners (for example, airline companies).
Finally, the Council encourages the Commission to
continue coordinating EU action on SARS;
keep the orientations for immediate and future actions under regular review, notably in the light of advice from the WHO;
consider developing a general preparedness plan on communicable diseases and health threats;
coordinate and network laboratory expertise;
financially support research and development of validated diagnostic tests, therapeutic interventions, and vaccines.
The Council reviewed the situation and developments at its meeting on 2 June 2003, took note of the Commission's progress report on recent developments in connection with SARS and exchanged views on the current situation.
All the Member States approved the Commission report and the initiatives taken or planned in this area.
The Presidency emphasised the importance of coordinating the exchange of information at European level, given the cross-border nature of SARS.
Thank you, Mr President.
My question was put before it had even been decided to convene the Council of Ministers for Health in May and I wish to say that the President-in-Office's reply was so full and extensive that it obviates the need to ask a second question.
Question No 3 by Bernd Posselt (H-0300/03):
Subject: EU/Ukraine
How does the Council view the current state of relations between the EU and Ukraine, and what initiatives has the Presidency undertaken to intensify cooperation with the Black Sea states?
The Union is closely monitoring developments in the Ukraine and recognises Ukraine's achievements over recent years in establishing itself as an independent, democratic European country with a market economy.
The Ukraine is an important strategic partner and will soon become a neighbouring country of the ?U. The Union is dealing positively with Ukraine's European aims, but underlines that the development of relations between the ?U and the Ukraine depends, among other things, on the favourable outcome of continuing internal reforms.
The new coalition government and cooperation between the majority and the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament in certain legislative sectors can be seen as positive signs.
The government and the parliament are working together to adapt national legislation to the acquis communautaire.
However, a great deal still needs to be done.
In particular, reforms are needed in the fields of the mass media and the judiciary.
The situation regarding arms exports, including Kolchuga, still needs to be clarified.
Ukraine's candidacy for the WTO is an important step in the development of the country, but the rules of the WTO need to be kept and applied.
Within these frameworks, policies and important structural reforms are still outstanding.
Cooperation between the ?U and the Ukraine is based on the partnership and cooperation agreement which introduces the legal framework for cooperation in a broad range of sectors; I would especially mention, among other things, energy, trade and investments, justice and internal affairs, legislative rapprochement, the environment, transport and regional and cross-border cooperation.
The ?U will continue to provide assistance within the framework of the TACIS programme, based on the priorities agreed between the two parties.
With the 'Wider Europe' initiative, the ?U has made an important step as regards strengthening cooperation with the Ukraine, which is a neighbour following enlargement.
Within the framework of this initiative, a clear action programme is defined as regards medium-term neighbourly relations with the Union, with a view to promoting policies for political rapprochement and the gradual joint completion of social and economic structures and increasing political, economic and cultural momentum, on the basis of common values.
The competent Council services are drafting specific measures in order to implement this initiative.
The Union vigorously supports regional cooperation in Europe and beyond and is urging the Black Sea states to promote good neighbourly relations through the Black Sea Economic Cooperation pact.
This regional organisation provides important momentum, thereby contributing to a considerable degree to the implementation of the stability pact for south-eastern Europe.
By promoting economic cooperation as a means of preventing conflict, this organisation seeks to resolve conflicts peacefully on the basis of the principles of the OSCE.
The Union notes these developments with satisfaction and supports the integration of the participating states in the European economy.
Mr President, thank you for your very sound answer.
Even before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Bavaria maintained a close partnership with Ukraine and my colleague Mr Radwan and I have just given a massive boost to trade with Ukraine.
Trade and business need a framework, however.
For this reason, I would like to raise two quite specific questions: first, to what extent is the TACIS Programme being intensified, with a focus on institution building and training up a new, younger generation of executives to work in the government, the judiciary and the administration?
This, after all, is where the shortage is greatest, and the reason why the economy is unable to function. The framework for the rule of law is not functioning.
My second specific question, Mr President, concerns the geostrategic situation that you mentioned.
Here, of course, the countries in the southern Caucasus play an important role, although they will not be direct neighbours of the EU.
I wanted to ask you what the role of the southern Caucasus is in terms of cooperation with the Black Sea states?
Institution building is indeed a very basic element for progress and reform in these countries.
However, I hope that the honourable Member understands that institution building also has to do with internal efforts by each country to respond to the needs of reform.
A programme such as TACIS or any programme can, at most, have an auxiliary role in this direction.
I cannot give an answer straight away as to whether it will be intensified from the economic point of view.
I gladly reserve the right to reply in writing.
As far as the Caucasus is concerned, the Presidency has noted the particular importance of the countries in the Caucasus and the need for us to develop our cooperation and our relations with these countries.
However, these countries have a great many problems and closer rapprochement with the countries in the Caucasus is a long-term plan, I believe, in the Union's foreign policy.
I trust that this effort will be made by successive Presidencies, just as we have made certain moves in this direction during our Presidency, because we really do believe it is of value.
I wish to ask the Greek Presidency how the Council views the fact that Ukraine is a dangerous country for journalists to operate in.
I also wonder how the Council views the fact that the fate of ten journalists, including that of Georgij Gongadze who is critical of the government, remains unknown and uninvestigated.
As you know, we have no knowledge of the fate of certain journalists in the Ukraine.
I cannot answer generally as to whether it is dangerous for journalists to work there; however, it is particularly worrying that such incidents occur.
It is an issue which was also noted in the public statements made at the press conference which I gave together with the High Representative, Mr Solana, when we visited the Ukraine within the framework of cooperation relations, during the meeting we had at troika level a few months ago.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is your assessment of Ukraine's efforts with regard to the World Trade Organisation?
I cannot proceed to evaluate efforts by the Ukraine in relation to the World Trade Organisation.
Please submit your question to the Commission.
The Council attaches particular importance to the implementation of the Galileo programme under optimum conditions.
The Council welcomes the agreement which has finally been reached between the Member States of the European Space Agency and which also puts an end to the Agency's difficulties to date as regards the cofinancing of the Galileo programme, thereby making it possible to continue the programme and allay the concerns of the partners that have proceeded to make, and will continue to make, important investments in time, manpower and financial resources for studies, designs and programmes at the pre-development stage.
Similarly, the Council wishes to point out that it is not authorised to intervene in decisions by an intergovernmental agency such as the European Space Agency, even if the large majority of the countries which participate in it (13 out of the 15 members) are also members of the European Union.
Mr President, I asked this question before this agreement came along, which paves the way for the implementation of this very important programme, and I am delighted that this has happened under the Greek Presidency, given that I am Greek, and I also have a great deal of respect for the President-in-Office who has replied to me.
As this obstacle has been removed, I should like to ask the honourable President-in-Office to tell us what he calculates will be the amount invested in Galileo, if all the Member States of the European Union will take part in it and in what proportion, when the procedure to promote implementation will commence and when he calculates that it will start to provide its services, which is the most important, and if they will be of only European and/or worldwide range.
Similarly, I should like to ask him to tell us if the objections of the United States have been answered and if, in fact, as the American side maintains, there will be a danger of Galileo interfering with the American GPS frequencies, which in fact give priority to military requirements.
I cannot reply to all these details straight away.
These are Commission issues.
There are various evaluations which have been discussed from time to time and evaluations by independent researchers.
I would ask the honourable Member to put this question to the Commission.
I will gladly forward in writing any information which the Council has at its disposal, which answers the question he has raised.
Mr President, I hope my question is addressed to the Council, because Member States still have authority over matters of foreign and security policy.
I would like to point out at this juncture that although GALILEO is primarily a private-sector project, and one in which we also want to have private-sector services, in a common project for a stronger European Union foreign and security policy we should be setting the course now to ensure that in future infrastructure services and information services will be available and can be purchased at European level.
Up to now, unfortunately, we have not had the infrastructure.
We talk about a rapid reaction force, and in order to be able to act in future in the area of foreign policy, we must be able to rely on GALILEO.
This is why a line should be made available here, and this is certainly something that is also in the interests of the Council.
I agree that Galileo also has a political dimension, which is why it has also been promoted by the Council.
Nonetheless, the Galileo programme also has a very strong commercial dimension and I would like to point out that the Council is, nonetheless, interested in its progressing, its being able to withstand competitive and economic conditions on the market and its remaining viable.
Question No 5 by Paulo Casaca (H-0312/03):
Subject: List of terrorist organisations
As the person responsible for the disarmament of the Iranian armed resistance, the People's Mujahedeen, General Odierno declared (Agence France Presse on 11.5.2003) that the group's cooperation with the US forces and its commitment to democracy in Iran meant that its status as a 'terrorist organisation' in Washington would have to be reviewed.
He added that an organisation which gives up its arms in favour of the alliance is clearly cooperating and that this should lead to reconsideration as to whether or not the Mujahedeen are a terrorist organisation.
This is further confirmation of the fact that there are no grounds for considering the People's Mujahedeen a terrorist organisation.
When does the Council intend to remove the People's Mujahedeen from the list of terrorist organisations?
I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but you have only said what we all knew already.
What you did not explain, and what I would like you to explain now, is how an organisation that has never been found guilty or even accused of any terrorist crime or any other crime on European soil can be included on this list, whilst Iran, for example, one of whose diplomats has already been convicted by a German court for committing a terrorist attack, does not appear on the list and is actually encouraging the proscription of organisations that oppose it and naming them as terrorists.
This is the problem and I would like the Council to give its opinion and an explanation to Parliament and to Europe's citizens.
The Council has judged, on the basis of an evaluation of all the factors, that this organisation should be included on the list.
Similarly, I should like to point out that this evaluation was based on information given to the Member States in accordance with the procedures provided for and that there is a collective decision on this matter.
The Council's response is of some interest in that it is rather hard to understand the criteria the Council uses to judge whether or not an organisation should or should not be deemed a terrorist organisation.
I think that the rules of due process, of fair legal proceedings, should at least allow the various organisations to have the right to resort to the courts. Parliament is entitled to be informed of the dossier the Council used to make its decision.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I therefore have some very specific questions for you.
Would the Council be willing to supply the European Parliament with the documents detailing the charges levelled against all the groups you consider to be terrorist organisations?
Would you also be prepared to define the criteria you applied in establishing whether or not the group was a terrorist organisation?
As we are aware, Russia has just requested that three Chechen groups be added to the list of terrorist organisations, although two of these groups are in fact completely non-existent.
This is a particularly interesting case, incidentally.
The common position to which I referred makes provision for all the criteria which are taken into account in order to enter names, agencies or persons on this list.
I should like to remind you that decisions on who is to be included on the list are taken by officials of the judiciary who are independent of each Member State of the European Union and who provide all the guarantees of a correct judgment on the matter, because this is indeed a very delicate matter.
Mr President, this second response is wholly unconvincing: we know full well that there are absolutely no clear procedures for inclusion on the list of terrorist organisations.
Mr Dupuis has asked quite clearly to be informed of the procedures which exist for appealing against inclusion on the list.
The truth is that the only criterion for either inclusion on or removal from the list is political judgment.
We therefore need to ask the question again.
We are simply asking the Council to give an opinion on this political judgment, this new political development: is it such a major political change as to really justify reviewing the role of the organisation?
I have nothing to add to what I have said.
The criteria and procedures are provided for and are clear.
The competent agency judged that it should remain on the list and, consequently, I have no criticism to make of that.
Question No 6 by Lennart SacrÃ©deus (H-0313/03):
Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba
In March this year, 78 opposition figures were imprisoned in Cuba. Summary trials with no chance of a proper defence or the presence of independent individuals were held in April, followed by sentences of 15 and 28 years.
The prisoners are now serving their sentences under inhuman conditions, in solitary confinement or together with hardened criminals, most often so far from home as to make visits by relatives impossible.
These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights.
What does the Council intend to do to secure the release of political prisoners in Cuba?
What is the Council doing to ensure that the treatment of the Cuban prisoners improves and that they are moved nearer to home?
What steps will the Council take to support the prisoners and their relatives?
What consequences will these jail sentences have in terms of further negotiations concerning Cuba's possible membership of the ACP?
As the Council replied to question ?-0243/03 at Question Time during the May part-session of the European Parliament, as soon as the recent wave of arrests came to light, the Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, issued public statements and proceeded with intense demarches towards Havana.
In their bilateral contacts with the Cuban authorities, the Member States also protested strongly about the arrests and executions.
The Council welcomes the resolution by the European Parliament of 10 April reinforcing the Union's clear stand against these measures.
At its meeting on 14 April, the Council approved the following conclusions:
'The Council condemns the recent actions of the Cuban authorities, notably the executions, the large-scale arrests of dissidents, the unfair trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed.
It calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
These latest developments which mark a further deterioration in the Human Rights situation in Cuba will affect the EU's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation.
The Council will keep the situation under close review.'
The Union also supported resolutions on the human rights situation in Cuba passed within the framework of the 59th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
As a general comment, the Presidency of the Union issued the following declaration stating that the ?U condemns the large-scale arrests, the unfair summary trials and the arbitrary and excessive sentences imposed on numerous dissidents for peacefully expressing their political, religious and social opinions and because they were exercising their right to take full and equal part in public life.
Consequently, the ?U demands that those persons, whom it considers prisoners of conscience, be released without delay and also calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
It is also deeply concerned at the continuing repression of members of the opposition.
The ?U roundly condemns the recent executions of Cuban citizens carried out following summary trials and expresses its regret that the moratorium on the death penalty in the country has come to an end.
These latest developments, which mark a further deterioration in the human rights situation in the country, will affect the ?U's relationship with Cuba and the prospects for increased cooperation.
The ?U will monitor violations of personal and political rights, which continue to affect the Union's relationship with Cuba, very closely.
The ?U will continue to keep the situation under close review, especially as regards the possible exercise of legal recourse for the 78 persons convicted.
I should also like to point out that the Union is continuing to make efforts to get the political prisoners released immediately and to ensure that, in the meantime, they are not suffering or being treated inhumanely.
As far as Cuba's application to accede to the Cotonou Agreement is concerned, the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs withdrew its application on 17 May.
I wish sincerely to thank the Greek representative of the Council for his committed answer and for the work that is being done.
A very sincere thank you for that.
What the Council is saying extremely clearly in this House is very important, namely that the human rights situation has deteriorated, that the prisoners and the long sentences have affected our future relations with Cuba and that the 78 prisoners must now be given the right to appeal.
As a follow-up question, I wonder, then, if the European Council could take practical action by offering the winner of the Sakharov Prize , the Christian Democratic human rights activist Oswaldo PayÃ¡ SardiÃ±as, a formal invitation to Greece and the European Union.
By doing this, it would also be encouraging the prime ministers and foreign ministers of the Member States in that way to emphasise the value of the Sakharov Prize.
I have nothing further to add.
I have taken note of the honourable Member's proposal and we shall see if this can be done.
I thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council.
One month ago we held the same debate, and I would now like to take it a little further.
After more than a month, the repression continues in Cuba and the situation remains more or less the same, which is proof that we must go beyond statements of condemnation.
These are important but are not enough and we have a particular responsibility because we awarded the 2002 Sakharov Prize to Osvaldo PayÃ¡.
This is the time for us to show that the Sakharov Prize is not a nice school prize; it is not a moment of 'glamour' like the Hollywood Oscars. It represents a commitment given by the European Union, through its Parliament, to the cause of democracy, human rights and freedom throughout the world.
Eleven of our fellow Members, myself included, have sent a letter to the President of the Council, the High Representative, the President of the Commission and the President of Parliament, asking them to work together to invite Mr PayÃ¡ to come here and for the Council to draft a recommendation to this effect to all Member States for their ambassadors in Havana to do the same and invite Mr PayÃ¡ to come to Europe, to visit our capitals, our ministers, our prime ministers and the President of the Commission and, in the international limelight, tell us the tragedy of what is happening in Cuba.
This is an active way of our expressing solidarity, and of showing that the prizes we award here have real meaning.
Who sent it?
Nothing else has come to my attention; consequently, I have no specific answer to give you at this moment in time.
Mr President, I am surprised that the MEP who asked the question has come out in support of the people arrested and tried, because they were demonstrably cooperating, in return for payment, with the representative of the United Nations in Havana against their country, against socialist Cuba, which is a beacon, a shining example for the peoples of America and which, despite forty years of criminal embargo by the United States, manages to provide its people with the highest standard of living and education in the whole of Central and South America.
This is, in fact, what the American imperialists cannot forgive the Cuban revolution and they are striving to overturn it by every possible means, including assassinating its leaders.

I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council who, from what I have heard, agrees with everything the previous speakers have said: What would the government of his country do if it were discovered that Greek citizens had agreed to be recruited and paid by a foreign power hostile to Greece in order to act against their country?
Perhaps it would have awarded them a prize?
How does this activity stand in relation to the exercise of human rights?
What comments does he have on the fact that the conspiratorial meetings organised by the US representative in Havana are also attended by Greece's diplomatic representative?
How does he justify the silence of the European Union about the Cubans being held in the United States because they uncovered plans to assassinate Fidel Castro and other Cuban leaders, and the failure to extradite to Cuba the Cuban hijackers who are now circulating freely in the United States?
For the rest, we are fighting to combat terrorism.
Mr President, to start with, this is not a question to which I shall reply.
I shall reply to one, not as the President-in-Office, but as the minister for foreign affairs of the Greek Government.
You referred to the involvement of a diplomat in conspiratorial and other types of activity.
It is altogether both comical and misleading, when you must have been told that I replied to a similar question by a member of your party in the Greek Government, when I said that it is ridiculous, at a reception given at the embassy in Cuba, the American embassy, where receptions are held every week by various and sundry people, and everyone goes here and there, to translate...
(interruption off the microphone by Mr Korakas)
Please do not interrupt... you are not worthy of a reply!
Mr Korakas has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, how dare Mr Yiannitsis say I am not worthy of a reply.
I have asked burning questions.
His government is also guilty and should reply with greater respect to the questions I put to him.
We referred extensively to the agenda for the Thessaloniki Council at this morning's debate.
However, I should like to add that, as this concerns the first version of the annotated agenda, which was also submitted to the recent meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Presidency intends to limit the agenda for the European Council in Thessaloniki to the following items:
results of the Convention on the Future of Europe and decisions for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference;
asylum, immigration and borders, which are all interrelated;
enlargement issues;
the question of EU policy in the Western Balkans;
Wider Europe, New Neighbourhood;
work following on from the spring 2003 European Council and, finally
certain issues in the fields of external relations and security and defence.
These items may be included in EU-USA relations: the Middle East and Iraq and recommendations by the High Representative, Mr Solana, on an overall strategy in the field of foreign policy and security, together with a wider strategy to deal with the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
The General Affairs and External Relations Council noted these intentions on the part of the Presidency.
As far as the issues touched on in the second part of the question are concerned, the honourable Member will know that the European Council has to examine two important reports.
The first is on the actual application of the guidelines agreed at the European Council in Seville on measures relating to illegal immigration, the more flexible introduction of coordinated and integrated external border management, the incorporation of immigration policy into the Union's relations with third countries and the speeding up of the legislative work to formulate a common policy on asylum and immigration issues.
The second report examines the efficiency of common financing resources available for the repatriation of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been rejected, for the management of external borders, for programmes in the field of asylum and immigration in third countries and for the application of the principle of the distribution of burdens.
Our aim is for the Council to examine these two reports so that the European Council can issue guidelines for further action in these sectors.
Within this framework, it is expected that, in accordance with the conclusions of the spring 2003 Council, the European Council will re-examine the issue of immigration, the integration of legal immigrants into European society and employment.
Finally, the Presidency would remind you that the agenda for the Thessaloniki Council will be approved, in accordance with the Council's rules of procedure, by the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its meeting on 16 and 17 June 2003.
Thank you for taking on the seventh question.
It has been a tough session.
In the debate this morning you answered many of the questions in your excellent reply.
I should just like ask for your personal view on one issue.
The Greek Presidency has been particularly good, in my view, in taking on positive issues in migration such as family unity and now integration.
On the issue of the integration of migrants, which you mentioned in your reply, is it your view that this is an issue primarily for Member States, or do you see a valuable coordination role?
We sometimes forget that there are many within our European societies who want to see better integration methods employed as well as coordination.
Is it your personal view that this is a matter for coordination, or is it primarily for Member States?
The question was put on a personal basis.
I can reply both personally and as the Greek Presidency.
This does not mean that my reply reflects the position of the 15.
As you know, there are countries which consider that these issues - relating to the integration of immigrants, in other words - are internal issues.
On the other hand, however, failure to integrate immigrants living, in their millions no less, in the Member States of the European Union, often causes particularly acute social situations and these often also have serious repercussions at political level, with highly undesirable consequences.
Given that the European model - this social, political and economic model - is characterised by internal social convergence which perhaps is hard to find in many other countries of the world and, consequently, we need to keep it as a very basic element both for our countries and our continent, I personally consider that, on the issue of the integration of immigrants, there must also be coordination of policies at Community level, because any serious social and political tension in one country is something that is also of particular importance to the other countries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to make a brief comment regarding my question 3 concerning Ukraine: it goes without saying that this is a matter for the European Union, because the accession of Russia and Ukraine to the WTO has consequences affecting this and this will probably also be a topic for discussion at the Council in Thessaloniki.
My question concerning the Thessaloniki Council, however, is this: the Council called for an impact study to be carried out on Basle II, the framework agreement on the creditworthiness of businesses.
The Commission has not yet done this.
At the last sitting you promised me you would takes steps to this effect.
What has happened here as regards the Council's enquiry or as regards the Council's cooperation with the Commission?
Are there plans to undertake such a study?
This issue concerns the Commission and, provided the Commission submits the study, of course we shall see how we can take it into account for Thessaloniki.
The issue of creating an intergovernmental Agency for Defence Capability Development and Acquisition was the subject of recent discussions within the framework of the European Council, which resulted in the formulation of paragraph 35 of the Presidency conclusions.
I refer to the European Council of 20 and 21 March.
On the basis of these conclusions, the Council addressed this issue, as it did within the framework of the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 19 May, when it reiterated this paragraph and, especially, the need to examine the possible creation within the framework of the Union of an intergovernmental defence capabilities development and acquisition agency.
The relevant work is continuing.
I should like to remind you that, at the initiative of the Greek Presidency and in a letter which we sent at the end of last year to the President of the Commission, we supported precisely the need for initiatives such as these, which come within the line of thinking of the question formulated by the honourable Member.
Thanks to the President-in-Office for that answer, and indeed for the support of his own government in respect of this point.
It was interesting to see that the recent meeting of four Member States on defence, convened by Mr Verhofstadt, supported the idea of an agency, just as the original proposal that came forward at Le Touquet was supported by my own Prime Minister, Tony Blair and also by Jacques Chirac.
Whatever differences exist as regards perspectives about defence cooperation in the European Union, it seems this is something that could unite us.
I wonder if the President-in-Office foresees any further progress on this issue during the remainder of his presidency, and whether he could try and put a timescale on how much progress we can make in bringing forward this idea?
Efforts have been made to bring forward this idea.
Now, whether the Greek Presidency will be able to make any progress within the remaining three weeks, is difficult to answer.
We need to bear in mind that, at the joint General Affairs Council held by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers for Defence, there was an opportunity to examine all these issues and I believe that perhaps the next opportunity will be later rather than sooner, within a period of three, four or five weeks in other words.
Question No 10 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0330/03):
Subject: The Iranian regime's nuclear weapons programme
On August 2002 the People's Mujahedeen denounced the Iranian regime's secret nuclear weapons programme.
Both state authorities and independent research organisations have confirmed the military purposes of this programme.
Even Commissioner Patten in his latest declarations seems to have now admitted this fact.
Can the Council explain what has been the role of the negotiations developed by EU and Iranian regime officials under the so-called 'constructive dialogue on energy' regarding this Iranian nuclear programme?
Can the Council explain what measures and changes in policy it intends to take to prevent the disastrous results of its present diplomacy regarding Iran?
Weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons and their non proliferation, are indeed an issue which is provoking a great deal of concern in the Union in connection with Iran.
Mr ElBaradi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, expects to submit a report to the board of governors of the Agency in question on 16 June, containing his findings on Iran's nuclear programme.
This report will contribute to the greater clarification of the situation as regards the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in Iran.
The Council will take account of this report when it discusses issues relating to Iran at its next meeting.
The question, which concerns the opinions expressed on this issue by the Commission, should rightly be submitted directly to that institution.
Similarly, the Commission will need to explain what is happening within the framework of what is referred to as the 'constructive dialogue on energy' with Iran, given that this dialogue is being conducted on behalf of the Union by the Commission.
The Council, especially within the framework of the broad dialogue between the Union and Iran, regularly raises the question of weapons of mass destruction and their non proliferation; the last time was on 29 April.
The Council calls on Iran to sign, to ratify and to implement fully the relevant international agreements, especially the Additional Protocol to the ???? guarantee agreements.
These issues were raised at the round of negotiations for a trade and cooperation agreement between the Union and Iran held in Teheran on 1 and 2 June.
The Council clearly stated to Iran that it expected that deepening of economic and commercial relations between the Union and Iran should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of the EU's relations with Iran.
Finally, I would add that the Union attaches great importance to achieving global compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in the establishment of a verifiable nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East.
Mr President, I agree with the Council that it is the Commission who is conducting the constructive dialogue on energy.
Nonetheless, the Commission, like the Council and the European Parliament, is part of the European Union and moreover it is for the Council to establish the broad guidelines on foreign policy.
Consequently, if the report due to be presented soon by the International Atomic Energy Organisation contains negative conclusions, will the Council ask the Commission to break off this constructive dialogue on energy?
This is what I would like to know.
It is indeed the Commission that implements decisions but it is primarily the Council that establishes the broad guidelines.
I have already stated in my reply - and I wonder why this is being asked a second time - that the Council will take account of the report to be submitted when it discusses issues relating to Iran at its next meeting.
Now, hypothetical questions about what this report will contain and what the Council will do if the report contains A, B or X, I cannot discuss at present.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are nearly out of time, but we will try to deal with two more questions on Iran, if the President-in-Office is willing to stay until 7.15 p.m., since we began late.
Thank you very much.
Mr Casaca has the floor for a supplementary question.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to ask you whether you do not find it strange that the positions you have adopted are not those held by judges, or by anyone independent; instead they are the Council's own political positions on terrorist organisations when nowhere in the press is there any mention of the matter.
Where the nuclear programme in Iran is concerned, however, there is an enormous amount of detail in the scientific press and elsewhere on Iran's use of heavy water, which is only used in the construction of nuclear weapons, and the Council is doing absolutely nothing and confines itself to waiting for any future reports that the Iranian Government might submit.
I said that there will be a report from the most authoritative international organisation.
The Council will take account of this report and will decide what it is going to do on the basis of it.
I would remind you that the Council has said that there will be no progress on economic and trade issues if there is no progress on the issues we are discussing; consequently, there is a de facto link between the two.
Question No 11 by Gianfranco Dell'Alba (H-0331/03):
Subject: Destabilisation of the Middle East promoted by Iran
After Lebanon and Palestine, the Iranian regime seems to be focusing its efforts on spreading a theocratic dictatorship in Iraq, profiting from the instability prevailing in this country.
What does the Council plan to do to prevent further destabilisation of the Middle East by the Iranian regime?
The Council is well aware of the fact that the restoration of viable political and economic stability in Iraq will depend to a great degree on a constructive stand by neighbouring countries.
Consequently, the European Union is constantly urging neighbouring countries, including Iran, to demonstrate self-control and support efforts to stabilise Iraq.
The Council has identified the peace process in the Middle East as a basic field in which the Council wishes to achieve substantial progress through more intensive dialogue with Iran.
The Council has also made it clear to Iran that it expected that deepening of economic and commercial relations between the EU and Iran should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of the EU's relations with Iran.
Both Iraq and the Middle East were discussed extensively with the Iranian side during the last EU/Iran 'broad dialogue' meeting in Athens on 29 April.
The Union will continue to raise these issues in its contacts with Iran.
President-in-Office of the Council, today, something which we hope will be extremely significant is taking place in Sharm El Sheik: a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, which we hope will be genuinely constructive.
Europe is absent from these talks, and yet you are still advocating the idea of critical dialogue, which means conducting trade without giving much consideration or no genuine consideration to the matter of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
In the light of the news that Iran appears to be promoting this - as I mentioned in my statement - in the light of the protests of dozens of Members of Parliament, who are calling in a document for greater efforts, for Iran to democratise its system, failing which it will be necessary to take not necessarily military measures in its regard but measures which make it understand that critical dialogue is not the way to address issues, what is the Council's reaction to this increasingly urgent request from the Members of the European Parliament?
I have noted the wish for the Union to have a higher profile on this sort of issue.
It is a minor aspect of the more general problem we constantly discuss, by which I mean how the Union can have greater weight in the foreign policy area.
However, the Union was present at the meeting held in Crete a few days ago, at the Euro-Mediterranean conference, which was also attended by the Israelis and the Palestinians and numerous other Arab countries.
The climate which prevailed at the discussions which we held helped bring us to the point where we can now discuss developments which may be of particular importance.
Question No 12 by Maurizio Turco (H-0332/03):
Subject: The Iranian regime's anthrax programme
The People's Mujahedeen's denunciation of the Iranian regime's secret nuclear weapons programme in August 2002 has been proved completely correct, namely by independent research institutions, and therefore the public denunciation by the same organisation on 15 May of the Iranian regime's programme of anthrax production was naturally viewed with general acceptance by the international media.
What does the Council intend to do about the existence of such programmes?
The Council would emphasise that, as a general rule, weapons of mass destruction and their non-proliferation have indeed been one of the sectors in which the European Union has had concerns in connection with Iran for years now.
The Union is encouraging Iran to sign, ratify and fully implement the relevant international acts, especially, as I said earlier, the agreements of the International Atomic Energy Agency, because at present the Iranian nuclear programme is causing concern in the international community, to which I also referred.
The Union is also encouraging Iran to participate fully in the work which will lead to the sixth conference to review the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention, which is scheduled for 2006.
I should like to point out that the round of negotiations held in Teheran on 1 and 2 June on an EU/Iran trade and cooperation agreement provided an opportunity at just the right time to raise the above issues with this country.
As far as anthrax is concerned, the Council has no knowledge of any specific production programme of the Iranian regime.
However, any indication of the possible existence of such a programme will be taken into serious account and examined with all due attention.
This is the answer we are usually given every time anybody asks a question about relations between the European Union and any of the world's dictatorships.
There is no antidemocratic dictatorship in the world that is not funded by the European Union on the pretext that that serves as an opening for dialogue.
We can see what is happening in Vietnam, in Laos, in China, in Cuba.
Your words, President-in-Office, remind me of what was said in this Chamber in December 2000 with regard to the adoption of the joint resolution on Afghanistan.
It would seem ridiculous if we were to hear it again now.
Our short-sighted attitude to the future, despite the fact that we can already see clearly what is likely to happen, and this approach to international relations are disturbing as well as wholly unconvincing and herald much greater destruction than what we ourselves are already facilitating today.
Question No 13 by Marco Cappato (H-0333/03):
Subject: Democracy and human rights in Iran
Seven years after the Iranian regime tried to convince the Iranians and the international community that it was open to change and to democratisation, it is now clear - to all the observers, and to the Iranian people first and foremost - that nothing has changed for the better and no improvement in the human rights situation or the democratic rights has taken place.
Does the Council support an internationally monitored referendum on the establishment of a democratic regime in Iran?
The Council continues to have serious concerns about violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran.
The Council is making an effort to strengthen respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to promote the rule of law in this country.
This is being done, among other things, through the broad EU/Iran dialogue on human rights set up last December.
The Council has repeatedly made it clear that deepening of commercial relations between the EU and Iran - which are also the aim of the negotiations being held on a trade and cooperation agreement - should be matched by similar progress in all other aspects of the EU's relations with Iran.
This means that any reinforced cooperation and trade with Iran must go hand in hand with substantial positive developments in various sectors which are giving rise to concern in the Union, including and especially human rights.
Mr President, the issue raised in this question is actually the more general matter of the Council's willingness to make a clear, practical proposal on a transition which it considers to be essential and indispensable in the process of democratisation.
My question referred to a referendum on the establishment of democracy.
If we do not want a referendum, then other instruments can be found.
The important thing is for the Council to lay down the parameters.
This is an explicit request.
We cannot be content with calling for dialogue and mutual understanding and saying that the situation needs to be improved.
There must be firm points of reference.
You are against a referendum?
Then we want to know what points of reference the Council is establishing, what you consider to be the lowest common denominator, the absolute minimum.
Since you are telling us today that our trade agreements will be subject to the evaluation of progress made in democracy and human rights, our question is: If there is not to be a referendum, then what threshold, what instrument, what parameter do you consider to be the absolute minimum?
Otherwise, we will just go round and round in circles, and then - you never know - the United States might intervene, amid general outcry, and propose other solutions or instruments.
Mr President, I would find the idea of Parliament's passing such a resolution, proposing a change of regime in Iran and a referendum on the introduction of democracy, extremely interesting.
From a political point of view, the Council will bear it in mind before it decides what to do.
Thank you very much, Mr Yiannitsis.
President.
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end, Questions Nos. 14 to 21 will be answered in writing.
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report (A5-0143/2003) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on analysis of the open coordination procedure in the field of employment and social affairs, and future prospects [2002/2223(INI)], and
