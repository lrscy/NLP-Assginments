Mr President, Italy insists that the Intergovernmental Conference must be ready to begin by December so that President Berlusconi can issue invitations to the Rome Summit and solemnly bury the Treaty of Rome and give birth to the Rome Constitution.
A serious constitution cannot be devised as quickly as that.
When the EU is equipped with common citizenship, fundamental rights and a whole charter of rights that can be invoked directly before the courts, the character of the whole cooperative enterprise is altered, and every single provision of Title III is to be read in a new light and can acquire new significance.
To cite just one example: when the Treaty of Maastricht introduced common citizenship, it was expressly stated in writing that citizenship had no direct effect.
The judgments of the Court of Justice nonetheless caused citizenship to be of direct effect, and people are now free to settle anywhere in the EU and have their rights further extended by means of the many fundamental principles in Title I of the Constitution and Title II of the Charter.
The people and the elected representatives should be aware of all the consequences of the Constitution before it is adopted.
This will require a large number of working parties, opportunities to table amendments and transparent democracy.
What would the Constitution mean, for example, for the Danish summer house protocol?
Denmark prohibits Germans from purchasing summer houses in the way that Danes can.
This quite clearly contravenes the ban on national discrimination under Article 4 and the principle of equality under Article 44.
Can two such fundamental principles be set aside by an exemption, in the form of a protocol, to the rules governing the free movement of capital?
Is there a hierarchical relationship between the fundamental principles and the other provisions in the Constitution and protocols?
Alternatively, take Article 51, which protects the structure of the churches.
Denmark can in this way retain a Protestant state church, but can Article 51 also lift the ban on religious discrimination in Article 2, paragraph 21 of Title II?
Is the Danish constitution lawful or unlawful?
It would be nice to know the answer before the Constitution is signed.
Article 12(2) renders the majority of all the international agreements unlawful, for the EU would be given not only shared competence but also sole competence to enter into any agreement if only an internal act were affected.
Ought it not at least to be stated in writing that all existing agreements shall continue in force until such time as they are altered?
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let us take a practical look at what is already happening.
We must measure in this way, with intellectual honesty and, I believe, this form of cooperation, any difference between what is said and what is done.
On 7 June, Mr Berlusconi, in Jerusalem, you said, and I quote: 'In the future, Europe must include Israel.
We look on Israel as a European nation to all intents and purposes: cultural, economic and political', going on to describe it as the Middle East's only true democracy.
I repeat: 'In the future, Europe must include Israel.
We look on Israel as a European nation to all intents and purposes.'
This is the official wording of the written document we have. 'In this context,' (the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership) - and I quote - 'we shall not neglect the need to consolidate relations with Israel with the prospect of more extensive and structured reciprocal cooperation'.
This is the line taken by those who oppose Israel's entry into the European Union, for, clearly, those who are opposed do not say 'We don't want these dirty Jews'; they say 'Cooperation is enough'.
We support Mr Berlusconi who, at that time, was not yet President-in-Office of our Council.
Similarly, as regards Turkey, we have always heard Russia, Turkey and Israel specified.
Here, too, your text explicitly denies the goal of Turkey's accession.
What does it say?
'The Italian Presidency furthermore considers it essential to inject more specific content into relations with the Russian Federation' and so on.
This is quite clear. As regards Turkey, '? we are engaged in jointly monitoring its path to integration, encouraging the Government in Ankara to continue its efforts in the fundamental process of internal reforms.'
And that is supposed to herald its accession!
It is true that Mr Buttiglione has said in recent days that Turkey is a military regime which can never become part of the European Union, but without the soldiers it becomes a theocracy.
This is Christian Europe!
I would just like to say one thing very briefly, and we must admit it. It is not true that there is a history of Europe - just one: there are many.
There is the history of the Reformation and the Counter Reformation, there is the history of a Europe which produced victorious communisms and victorious fascisms and nazisms, which produced, and still produces today, antidemocracy.
Then there is the other history, the history condemned, I regret to say, by our Polish Pope when he condemns liberalism. By the way, it is liberalismo, Mr Watson, not liberismo: here we have had liberalism for a century.
There is a Europe of the Pontifical Zuaves - European and French Zuaves - fighting the Italian risorgimento.
There is a Europe which is the Europe opposed to our Europe of Altiero Spinelli, of Ernesto Rossi, of the Europe, Mr Berlusconi, which you heralded at the G8 in a way which I applauded. We Radicals applauded!
We want to take Europe closer to the World Democracy Organisation and focus actively on the Community of Democracies.
We applauded at the G8!
Today, of course, Mr Watson was quick to stress the Keynesian nature of your speech, but I have always maintained that, culturally, there is essentially great similarity between you and President Prodi when it comes to the political choices you make.
Giulio Tremonti talks of 'Colbertism' rather than 'Keynesianism', but when all is said and done ?
There are just two things we have to ask from you, then.
Firstly that, at the United Nations General Assembly, the European Union includes or brings about the inclusion, as Mr Fini announced, of the question of the moratorium on the death penalty. Secondly that, starting with the UN events, the Democratic Caucus representatives should be convened by the Presidency of the European Union.
If you comply with these two requests then we will be more than content.
As far as the rest is concerned, I wish you and us all luck.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, a year and a half ago, when the Convention's work started, few were convinced that a dream could actually come true; few believed that Europe could, as is now happening, build itself an institutional structure that could enable it to take on ever greater responsibilities on the international stage.
Those few have now become the vast majority.
This excellent result - which your government, Mr President-in-Office, so strongly desired - marks the beginning of a presidency packed with more undertakings and more hopes than any other in recent years.
Italy, a founding country, was given a mandate by the countries of the Union at Thessaloniki to carry the work of the Convention through to its conclusion.
That is not all.
Europe has chosen Rome to be the venue for the signing of the first Constitution: this is a political result of great significance, an historic act of recognition for Italy and for its freely elected government.
This recognition will encourage and support it in its work over the coming months, Mr President-in-Office - work which I am certain will enable us to achieve the objectives you have set out in this House.
The text we approved at the conclusion of the Convention's work certainly leaves room for improvement but, as you said, it represents a fundamental working basis that cannot be misinterpreted.
Your programme, which we in the European People's Party endorse, is mapping out for tomorrow a reunified Europe, which is an ally of the United States but is capable of shouldering responsibilities that until now it has been unable to take on.
In defining a balanced system of Council, Commission and Parliament - we in this House acknowledge, Mr President-in-Office, that you have underlined the importance of the role that the European Parliament plays and will continue to play in the IGC - and in designating a President of the Council and a Minister for Foreign Affairs, the new Treaty will provide an answer to the question 'Where is Mr Europe?', which anyone looking for clear interlocutors in our continent might ask.
The demise of the principle of unanimity is the other option that will enable us to overcome obstacles that have all too often blocked European initiatives.
Let us hope, therefore, that the Intergovernmental Conference will increase the number of subjects which can be decided upon by majority voting.
The Constitution is, however, merely an instrument: its provisions cannot produce an effect if the political will is lacking.
Mr President-in-Office, your speech clearly showed Italy's decision to give great weight to the Union's actions abroad.
If we so desire, Europe - with its attention turned towards the east and also the south - can play a leading role in promoting peace, progress, security, development and social justice, not least for the weak and those with disabilities, as you mentioned.
A Constitution and political will alone, however, are not enough to make reality the project of the likes of Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman, Alcide De Gasperi, Jean Monnet, Gaetano Martino and Altiero Spinelli.
Europe will not succeed if it cannot speak to the hearts of its citizens.
Europe will be the Europe of values: it is in values that our origins are rooted.
I hope that the IGC will want to include an explicit reference to our Judaeo-Christian roots in the preamble to the secular Constitution of our Europe because, if we lose sight of our origins, we shall not succeed in treading new paths or looking towards those new horizons that tomorrow's Europe must reach.
Mr President-in-Office, the problems we have to face at this moment are vital for the future of the Union and we intend to give them absolute priority.
It is on these that we shall assess the work of your presidency.
The concerns that have surrounded it, however, are not all due to prejudice.
The unresolved conflict of interests remains a legitimate source of concern that extends well beyond our own country.
In addition, the resignation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Ruggiero, had a significant effect on the way people understand Italy's role in Europe, the same Europe that Minister Bossi dubbed 'Forcolandia' ['Gallowsland'] because it is repressive, and which he has today branded a neo-Jacobin project, intrinsically authoritarian and globalising.
Perhaps this accounts for your coolness towards working seriously on the construction of a European area of justice, freedom and security, starting with the European arrest warrant, which ought to be approved by December 2003.
Major problems, I was saying: the Constitution, first of all.
We ask that the next Intergovernmental Conference should not put the Convention's results forward for further discussion and that Italy should make every effort to improve the text on essential points, such as the extension of majority voting.
On economic questions, we see that the Italian Presidency intends to relaunch the idea of public investment for infrastructure.
We shall also add training, research and the environment.
This proposal can only make headway if it adopts a truly European perspective, if it is firmly anchored in the Community method and is financially viable.
With regard to pensions, you are well aware, Mr President-in-Office, that Europe has no competence in the field of social security schemes, which are so diverse and so closely tied in with welfare policies.
Does the Presidency really mean to promote a European initiative in the economic and social field?
Well, then, it should do its best to have taxation and social policies brought within the Community's competence in the new Treaty, based on the guidelines of real European control of the economy, as this Parliament has been demanding for some time.
In these matters, however, the method of consulting the social partners has to be followed, as laid down in the Lisbon strategy.
As regards immigration, one cannot invoke just one piece of European policy - the part relating to frontier controls to combat illegal immigration - and ignore all the others, on the management of the influx and the reception and rights of those who, by coming here to seek work, contribute to the economic growth of our countries, those, let us be clear, whom your Minister for Reforms lumps together as 'Bingo Bongos'.
Lastly, on the matter of foreign policy, it is possible to be both Europeans and friends of the USA.
Friendship, however, is a relationship that must not fall into subservience.
After the difficult Iraqi crisis, it is therefore even more urgent to define a sound common foreign and security policy, backed by overthrowing the right of veto.
A clear framework for the Union's foreign relations was drawn up at Thessaloniki, distinguishing further prospects of enlargement from closer relations with our neighbours; in this context, after the contradictory statements that you and your Minister for European Policies have made regarding Turkey, we hope that what you told us this morning will stand.
Similarly, for the Middle East, we hope that the peace process will be supported by the Italian Presidency, but to reach this goal it will be necessary to talk to and take into consideration all the parties involved.
I wish you success in your work, Mr President-in-Office!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, today we are talking as Europeans; we do not bring to this House opinions on the internal politics of our countries.
In the next six months Europe must start moving faster; the constitutional treaty for a Europe of 25 should make the world realise whether our continent will continue to be a driving force for economic and social progress and, after the serious Iraqi crisis, whether it will equip itself with effective means to take a leading role in matters of security and freedom in partnership with the United States, in a new multilateral cooperation.
As a European, therefore, I hope for a successful Italian Presidency working in close collaboration with the Commission under Romano Prodi and with our Parliament.
Today, Mr President-in-Office, you have been cautious and made an effort to present your programme along lines of collaboration with the other countries and not in discontinuity with Italy's traditional policy for Europe.
We need to be bolder, however, if we do not want our compromises to slip away, especially as regards control of the economy, foreign policy and the necessary new defence policy, so as to minimise the risk of paralysis due to the need for unanimity.
Over these six months we expect a radical change that can remove the reasons for all the criticism, scepticism and concern that have surrounded these first few days of the period with you at the helm.
Indeed, it is not the internal politics of one country but all Europe that is calling for an end to conflicts of interest and media concentrations.
It is the liberal fundamentals of the separation of powers and the balance among the powers as reflected in the European Treaties which we have freely signed and by which we are bound.
The spirit of Rome of the 1957 Treaty was based on a daring vision of the future, and it constructed fifty years of democracy, prosperity and peace.
If we are guided by that vision, even from alternative political positions, we shall harvest common fruits for the good of Europe and its future.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our aversion to your politics and your government, as you know, is deep-rooted, and it would not make sense for us to do a U-turn now that your politics are being applied to Europe and not just Italy.
I think there is a rhetoric surrounding the six-month presidency of a nation, which cannot hide the political reality: the reality is that every presidency is the presidency of a government, not of a country; therefore, if people are against the Bush Administration it does not mean they are anti-American, and if people in Italy and Europe are against their government, it does not mean they are against Italy.
Europe is, of course, an important episode; it is a challenge that has quite rightly been called historic.
We are afraid that your government will aggravate rather than favour the necessary choices.
You are starting with a handicap: in Italy the country's consensus is split, a major part of European public opinion is contrary (and I believe the causes lie precisely in your politics), the bases for the economic crisis in the country have been distorted, as it has been under severe strain with the conflict of interests and the conflict between the established powers.
I personally feel the worst damage has been done by a minister in your government who can speak of the need to open fire on convoys of immigrants at sea.
We shall not, however, protest about your government's presidency; we shall confine ourselves instead to criticising your politics, the bases of which are essentially the primacy of the United States of America and the primacy of the market.
Both are factors of potential crisis for Europe: one, the United States, driven today by a doctrine of pre-emptive war; the other, the market, faced by a clearly developing crisis of social cohesion.
You, Mr President-in-Office, have put forward a proposal for a transatlantic, neo-liberal, post-democratic Europe.
We think this proposal goes against the vocation and historic mission of Europe today, of a Europe that needs another perspective.
Someone spoke of a Keynesian policy; I beg to differ: large-scale infrastructure is not a Keynesian policy; it may instead be a threat to the environment through deregulation, and it also runs the risk of not being completed because of the difficulties in financing it.
There is another side to your politics, however, which is neo-liberal through and through: it is what we call job insecurity and you call flexibility; it is what is shown - as, indeed, in other European countries - in the attack on the social security system.
This, Mr President-in-Office, is not Europe.
The real Europe is the one calling for independence from US policies for the sake of a different political culture, the one calling for a different social model.
Your strongpoint today is the weakness of political Europe, because the truth is that this political Europe is founded on a democratic deficit, and because I think that the Convention, too, is ambiguous and weak, a far cry from the great progressive constitutions.
Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, we shall not oppose you for the sake of this Europe, but for the sake of another Europe: a social and democratic Europe.
That is why our hope is - and please do not take this as a sign of hostility - that mass movement action in Europe will grow in both numbers of participants and importance during the Italian Presidency.
There is just one thing on which we should like to be able to come together with you: in calling loudly for a moratorium on the death penalty.
That, at least, would be a good sign of civilisation.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Italian Presidency is being greeted with mixed feelings.
You spoke about Italy's proud contribution to peace and international law, and we would ask you whether your presidency will feature as a milestone in this respect.
How, for example, would you deal with the pressure which the United States is currently putting on Serbia not to sign the Treaty on the International Criminal Court, while at the same time Europe wants to offer the Balkan countries the prospect of accession to the EU?
The refugees who wash up on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea are an indictment of the inhumanity of our system.
It will never work without legal immigration options.
You spoke, above all, about monitoring procedures and about sending people back, but sustainable development and peace in the countries from which people come must become a priority in the immediate future.
This development requires not only trade measures, but also respect for the environment and development opportunities for those countries.
They are now being robbed of everything and people are given weapons instead.
Peace in the regions in Europe is also important.
There are regions in every accession country that are waiting for opportunities and for sustainable development, because they are faced with impoverishment and depopulation.
This is also the case in some of our own regions.
We would ask for greater visibility of the regions in the Constitution.
Constitutional regions, in particular, wish to receive respect instead of supercilious treatment from the Member States that have the final say in every instance.
This only adds to the frustration in the constitutional regions.
I hope that your presidency will demonstrate an understanding of this.
Mr Berlusconi, I believe the most important task during the Italian Presidency will be that relating to the new constitutional treaty, which, let us recall, is not just concerned with ideas or concepts but addresses a territory and the people who live in that territory.
The work the Convention has done is good work: the initial basis is sound, it may be that only a few adjustments will be necessary, such as a better definition of the balance of legislative powers between Europe, between the Union and the individual states.
As for the problem of majority voting or unanimity in decision-making, we have to reconcile two needs: the need for efficiency and the need to respect the sovereignty and interests of the states that make up the Union.
In your speech, you repeated the word 'negotiation' several times.
I think some effort to reconcile different needs is also required in this area.
Lastly, I should like to mention something which I do not think it will be possible to achieve but which I must highlight: the need for a reduction in the Commission's monopoly on legislative initiatives to the benefit of this House.
Parliament does not have the right to initiate legislation - the only case in the world, I believe.
Even a mere town councillor can table proposals, but Members of the European Parliament do not have this right.
I believe this question at least deserves your attention.
I too offer you my best wishes for your Presidency.
Mr President, certain people should remember that we are debating today the programme of the Italian Presidency with which - and I am keen to point this out - I am essentially in agreement.
I hope that throughout these six months, at all times in fact, we will be able to distinguish between domestic ideological differences and the institutional responsibilities such as those which the great country of Italy is now taking on.
We take note, in this regard, of the commitment of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The main task of the Italian Government is to successfully organise the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) and to employ all its capacity for dialogue in order to bring the positions of the Member States together.
In this regard, we are grateful for the commitment of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.
The objective is for the IGC, in any event, to begin and end in Rome.
Time periods here, Mr President, are very important so that the countries which decide to hold a referendum on the ratification of the Constitution of Rome, allowing it to coincide with the European elections on 13 June 2004 - and I wish that were all of them - are able to do so.
In this regard, Mr President, please allow me to take this opportunity to urge the political opposition in my country to agree to a reform by consensus of the rules governing the referendum so that such a vote may be possible, as we all wish.
We would also like during this six-month period for strong impetus to be given to the negotiations for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and we call on the Presidency to do everything possible so that these negotiations may end within the time period of the current European legislature.
In terms of the European Union's internal policy, we fully support taking further steps on the Lisbon strategy and continuing to make progress on the area of freedom, security and justice, particularly in combating illegal immigration, and in terms of the foreign policy of the Italian Presidency we hope that it relaunches the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in Naples and we welcome its commitments in this respect on the creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, but in particular the relaunching of the idea of the Euro-Mediterranean Bank.
And we would also urge you to promote progress in the negotiations with Mercosur which the WTO will promote and which your Italo-Argentinian compatriots will no doubt welcome.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we wish you the best of luck because success during these six months will be a success for Europe.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, never before has a presidency attracted as much criticism and scepticism as this Italian Presidency.
There has been fierce criticism not only in the left-wing media, but also, to a great extent, in the conservative media.
This is not, however, something that we Social Democrats take any pleasure in, because we neither want nor are able to replace Italy's internal opposition.
In the interests of Europe, we wish the Italian Government a successful presidency; there is too much at stake to do anything else.
The problem lies, Mr Berlusconi, in the fact that we have heard so many contradictions from Italy in recent months.
Let us take foreign policy, for instance.
In your speech today, Mr Berlusconi, you talked about how Europe must be an active protagonist on the world stage, and about how we also need diplomatic and military instruments. You also talked about the need for a strong partnership between Europe and the United States.
You are absolutely right on all three counts!
The problem is that in recent months we have seen you, Mr Berlusconi, as a Prime Minister who has not nurtured partnership with the United States, but one who has practised servility and blind obedience.
We have witnessed a Prime Minister Berlusconi who was very reticent about creating a military arm for Europe.
What is more, Mr Berlusconi, I hope that you will adopt a more balanced position on the Middle East, and that you will emphatically call on both sides to refrain from resorting to violence.
We need to combat terrorism in the Middle East just as forcefully as we need to demand the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the dismantling of the wall that cruelly divides Palestine in two.
As regards the important issue of economic and financial policy, the statements made by the Italian Presidency so far have once again been contradictory.
The investment programme proposed by you and by Mr Tremonti for infrastructure projects and for research and development is a good idea as such.
But it is not yet clear whether it is just a question of weakening budgetary discipline or whether Italy is seeking support from Europe for projects it finds hard to finance.
In this case too I call on you to display more clarity and openness if we are to jointly implement the approach of the Delors White Paper and the Commission's proposals.
I have in mind in particular the proposals the Commission adopted when Karel Van Miert was in the chair.
If you can achieve that, Mr President-in-Office, if you can bring forward a coherent and precise proposal, you will also have the support of the Social Democrats.
Mr President-in-Office, every presidency runs the risk of confusing national and European interests.
The public has unfortunately gained the impression in recent months that in your case personal and political interests are also involved.
It would be dangerous for an EU presidency if personal, national and European interests were all mixed together ?
... and I hope that you will do your utmost during your presidency to make it crystal clear that you are not speaking as an Italian Prime Minister with a political axe to grind, but as the President of the Council of the European Union.
If you do that, even if we may follow your progress with a critical eye, we will nevertheless support you in your work.
(Applause)
Mr President, as an Italian and a Member of the European Parliament I feel embarrassed and worried but at the same time proud that my country, Italy, is today taking on the leadership of the European Union.
I feel embarrassed at all the criticism, censure, sarcasm and derision levelled at my country for what has, I regret to say, quite rightly been called the Italian anomaly, or the serious conflict of interests that involves our Prime Minister.
I also feel humiliated, because I recognise indeed that, whenever our Prime Minister expresses an idea, illustrates a proposal or presents a measure on the economy, finance, information or especially justice, we never know whether in doing so he is thinking of our interests or his own and those of his friends.
Or rather, we in Italy know only too well, unfortunately, given what he has done up to now.
I am worried because I do not want the conflict of interests virus that is humiliating Italian democracy to spread to a European level, because this is the real cancer for democracy, Mr Berlusconi, not the work of the judges, as you foolishly stated the other day.
I am, however, also proud - yes, proud - because, thank God, Italy's institutions are not just made up of the Prime Minister and the friends he has brought in with him, especially in the Italian Parliament.
That is why I am sure that Italy's leadership of the European Union will, as a whole, with the involvement and collaboration of all the institutions, including the oppositions, rise to the occasion despite the Italian anomaly, which I am glad to say is transient.
Mr President, Italy, which so long ago was among the founders of the European Community, today has the great task of taking Europe fully into its historic continental enlargement and the launching of its first Constitution.
This is our hope and also our commitment but, frankly, it is bad for Italy and for Europe that the person who is to represent us during the coming six months is Silvio Berlusconi.
The whole of Europe knows that he represents an anomaly unparalleled elsewhere in the world.
An immense weight hangs over him and his actions because of the ongoing conflict between his own personal interests and those of the people of Italy and Europe as a whole.
He is the richest man in Italy: his immense economic power and his private affairs, which are present in every field of activity, conflict with the laws, the standards and the very principles of the State; they conflict with justice, and that is the truth.
It is very sad for Italy and for Europe to have to read fierce criticism of him in the most respected newspapers in every country.
You have all read it, ladies and gentlemen, so I will not repeat it: it is harsh criticism, but it is true.
For all of us it is a cause of the greatest concern to see someone at the head of the Council who, during the war in Iraq, acted not to unite Europe but to divide it, by coming out against the feelings expressed by the vast majority of the people of Europe and once again adopting subservient positions towards the United States; someone who on international issues departs from the prevailing European line, on relations with Israel and Palestine, for instance, or the dramatic immigration question; someone who, on economic and social issues, starting with the attack on pensions, has espoused an extremely laissez-faire and deeply anti-popular line.
Mr Berlusconi is the right, and the worst, most dangerous kind of European right, and I therefore have no illusions.
Frankly, I expect the Berlusconi term of office will prove to be a total disaster.
I hope at least that, in the interests of Europe and my homeland of Italy, the damage can be kept to a minimum.
Let this be quite clear: for this reason we shall act decisively out of a pure sense of national responsibility and a staunch European spirit. For this very reason, we shall oppose him and his politics.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, in this Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and in European society, there is a profound distrust of the Italian Presidency. Not because of Italy, of course, the foundation of our culture, of many of our languages and of the very idea of Europe, but because of the political personality of President Berlusconi.
You, Mr Berlusconi, are one of the main representatives of the authoritarian right of our day, protagonist in the battle between the classes, internally and globally, between the rich and the poor and the workers. You even call people such as President Prodi, critical journalists and the judges who judge you 'communists'.
You use antiquated language, even troglodyte language, forgetting which century you are in.
You are a friend of Sharon against Arafat.
This distrust was ratified by certain key elements in your speech today.
You subordinate the constitution of the European Union to relations with the United States.
You are unaware of the chaotic and tragic situation in Iraq, caused by governments friendly to you.
You forget the Prestige disaster, which was suffered principally by my nation, Galicia.
You underplayed the constant deaths of immigrants, off both our coasts and in your island of Sicily.
You said nothing about the social Europe, about social and territorial cohesion, not even in view of the prospect of enlargement.
You did not expressly defend the draft constitution.
In Italy, Mr President, you were granted immunity.
Here, as President-in-Office of the Council, you will not have it.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, having welcomed, as is only right, your taking over the reins of the European Union, I must immediately express profound disagreement with the main emphasis you intend to give to your Presidency: that of positioning the European Union in the wake of the United States of America.
The peoples of Europe do not want this and demonstrated as much during the war in Iraq.
Nor is it the option favoured by the European institutions.
Following the example of Parliament, commitment to a multilateral world under the aegis of the United Nations rather than that of the United States has been expressed by the Commission in the shape of Commissioner Patten and Mr Prodi - the former hardly a dangerous left-winger, the latter perhaps a little more in that vein - and even by the Council, or at least to all appearances.
What Europeans are waiting for is the affirmation of their own European identity.
Public opinion has come into its own on this matter, Mr Berlusconi.
Do not disappoint it.
What, indeed, would be the use of this would-be constitution which, whether it be a source of delight or indignation, is a considerable leap forward in the direction of European sovereignty, if our continent were to end up becoming the handmaiden of the US empire?
Mr President, given that this treaty is to be signed in Rome at the beginning of May 2004, I hope you will be very keen to propose to your colleagues in the Intergovernmental Conference that the peoples of Europe, as sole wielders of sovereignty and, therefore, as those who alone are in a position to relinquish such sovereignty, should vote on this Constitution in a referendum.
Finally, the Ministerial Conference of the 'World Commercial Organisation' - a name I think is more apposite than World Trade Organisation - will be held in Cancun during your Presidency.
In the same spirit, I do not want this meeting to be the opportunity for our old Europe, to which we are ultimately rather attached, to sacrifice its cultures, its ways of life and its Community on the altar of unrestrained free trade.
Already, our agriculture has been more or less remodelled in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
I fear that our cultures, our identities and our specific character, which has, moreover, given birth to world civilisations, might suffer the same fate.
Mr President, Prime Minister, first of all, I should like to apologise today for the many insults which the Belgian ministers and party chairmen have levelled at the Italian Government and its Prime Minister.
I am particularly thinking of Mr Louis Michel, Foreign Affairs Minister, and Mr Elio di Rupo, the chairman of the Walloon Parti Socialiste.
The Italians should know that a large majority of Flemish people feel nothing but embarrassment about these gentlemen, who wanted to act as universal moral knights, while they would be better off putting their own house in order.
Despite this, we do not agree with the Italian Government's politics on every score.
For example, there is your position about Turkey's accession to the European Union.
My party, the Vlaams Blok, hopes nevertheless that under the Italian Presidency, work will be done on a stringent immigration policy, a bold policy against ever-increasing illegal immigration and all the problems of crime and social corruption that it brings with it.
Europe deserves pro-active politicians who refuse to buckle under the terror of political correctness.
If the Italian Presidency manages to draw up concrete European policy in all these areas, you will be able to count on our support.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, I want to begin by offering you our unqualified good wishes for a successful presidency.
Recently the debate over the structure, the powers and the institutions of the European Union has come to dominate almost every European discussion.
It therefore comes as a breath of fresh air to see that you have put the pursuit of the Lisbon strategy at the forefront of your policy objectives.
We need to face up to the challenges of economic change and reform.
At a time when Europe is facing deflation and stagnation, it is encouraging to see that you recognise the need to revive the process of major liberalisation of European economies.
We need real action on the Lisbon strategy rather than empty rhetoric.
The millions of unemployed throughout Europe want sustainable jobs, rather than our apparent obsession with institutional design and architecture.
Jobs and prosperity will have a more direct and real impact on the lives of the people that we are here to represent than tinkering with EU institutions.
Turning then to the IGC and the prospective new constitutional treaty, I urge you and your fellow Heads of State to return to the objectives that were set out in Laeken.
You were amongst the European leaders who called for the Convention to bring the EU closer to the citizens.
Some of us seriously question whether the outcome really achieves that.
The European governments should have that Laeken statement firmly in their minds when they begin the negotiations in the IGC.
Our political Ã©lites have always assumed that the only way that Europe can succeed is by regular, institutional change.
But our enlarged Europe of 25 states should be a place where proper respect for the diversity of nation states is upheld and defended.
Imposing a straitjacket of uniformity can only damage the true interests of unity in the EU.
I also applaud the statement that you made in your priority objectives, in which you say your desire to complete the work of the IGC is dictated by respect for the values of democracy and transparency.
We trust that you will keep to this in the intergovernmental negotiations that lie ahead.
I would also like to clarify a matter I raised in Parliament with President Cox yesterday.
The accession countries will be affected by the outcome of the IGC in the same way as the current 15 EU states.
I note that they will participate in the IGC on an equal footing with current Member States.
President Cox repeated that statement to me yesterday after my speech.
But what does it really mean in practice?
Surely it should mean that the accession countries have a full and equal right to vote in the Council on the outcome of the IGC?
Perhaps you can confirm whether that is also your understanding.
I also welcome your clear commitment to revive and reinvigorate the transatlantic relationship.
Recent events have damaged the strong ties that exist between Europe and the USA.
In a newspaper yesterday, you said that the West must be united.
There cannot be competition between us and America.
Given the growing strains between America and some countries in recent times, we are looking to you to take this priority forward as a high priority.
We must ensure that the European Union in the defence field does not pursue objectives that lead to antagonism with the institutions of the NATO Alliance.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to reply to Mr Poettering, who was waxing positively lyrical about the Presidency representatives who have travelled from Italy today: Berlusconi, Fini, Frattini, Buttiglione - I was even worried that he was going to move on to Maldini, Del Piero, Garibaldi and Cavour!
But there is one person he forgot, and that is Mr Bossi.
He is also a member of the Italian Government, and the least utterance from this man is far worse than anything that inspired this House to censure Austria and oppose the Freedom Party's inclusion in the Austrian Government.
We ought to talk about him as well!
I realise that you are not responsible for your ministers' IQs, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but you are responsible for what they say.
The comments made by Mr Bossi, your Minister for Immigration Policy, which you mentioned in your speech, are totally incompatible with the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
As President-in-Office of the Council, it falls to you to defend those values, so I call on you to defend those values against your own minister!
I would like to pick up on a point made here by Mr Di Pietro. He said that we should not allow conflict of interest to infect Europe.
Yes, he is quite right, and we have now found ourselves in a difficult situation for some days in this House whenever we talk about the Italian Presidency, because we keep being told, 'now you must be careful not to criticise Berlusconi because of what he is doing in Italy, because the European Parliament is not the right place for that'.
Why should that be?
Is Italy not a member of the European Union?
(Applause)
Of course the European Parliament is the right place, and I shall tell you why. The members of Italy's Parliament are elected to concern themselves with your actions as the Prime Minister of Italy, and we are elected to debate what you do as President of the European Council; that is our responsibility.
You talked about the area of freedom, security and justice, and about the Tampere process.
You used a single term, Europol, but you did not use those three terms.
I wanted to remind you about that and ask if you could say a few words about those three concepts.
What do you intend to do to speed up the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's office?
(Applause)
What do you intend to do to speed up the introduction of the European arrest warrant?
What are you planning to do about the mutual recognition of documents in cross-border criminal proceedings?
I think you could do with a little reform in your own country when it comes to the authenticity of documents.
If you were to implement that reform in your own country, the European arrest warrant could then come into force much more quickly.
Nevertheless, I am delighted that you are with us today and that I can have this debate with you.
We owe that not least to Mrs Nicole Fontaine, because if she had not made such a good job of dragging out the Berlusconi and Dell'Utri immunity procedures - Mr Dell'Utri being your right-hand man, who by way of exception is here today for once - if she had not done that, you would no longer have the immunity that you need.
That is another truth that needs to be spoken here today!
(Heckling)
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as an Italian Member of the European Parliament from the Movement of European Republicans in the ELDR Group and for Mr Martelli's Liberal Socialists, I can only hope that these six months will prove an assured success for Europe and for Italy.
To solve the difficult tasks that lay ahead of you - from major infrastructure to pensions and illegal immigration - you will not be needing sensationalist television formats but intelligent, creative work of political mediation, in order to honour the commitment you have made before this Parliament.
The profile of your actions must therefore be very high and focused on the major international options, most of all the new Constitution for the Twenty-Five, under which every step forward will be welcomed but no step backward will be allowed at all.
Rebuilding a real partnership with the United States must start with a direct relationship with the European Union, with Europe gradually taking on responsibility and leadership in NATO, with a moderate, rather than antagonistic or subservient view of the relations.
Therefore, Mr President-in-Office, we believe it is essential to encourage the United Kingdom to join monetary union so as to strengthen Europe at an international level.
The other difficult test lying ahead of you is the solution to the Middle East problem, bearing in mind that the roadmap requires a highly impartial attitude, and therefore European intervention must not be directed to just one side.
These are major challenges, Mr President-in-Office, for which, on behalf of myself and also our country, I wish you every success.
Mr President-in-Office, if there is one thing that worries me about the situation in Europe - and we have had a few examples this morning - it is a type of politics that all too often appears to be self-referential.
I am therefore sure - and the facts will confirm this - that your commitment to respond to the expectations of your European citizens every single day will mark out your Presidency.
The rule in our speeches is to try to make a contribution to the reports.
There is a great difficulty here, Mr President-in-Office, because the subjects dealt with have covered all our expectations.
There is just one point to which I should like to call your attention: during the six months of the Italian Presidency the new rules on cohesion policies will be drawn up.
In this context, I think the Italian Presidency should remind the European Union of a number of specific responsibilities, which are: to strengthen economic and social cohesion; to reduce the disparity in the development levels of many regions, which is still present in our Union and will be even more accentuated with enlargement; and to implement ideas of geographical solidarity, and in this respect we are thinking of the remoter regions.
This is based especially on three principles: that without resources the cohesion policy will be difficult to implement; that the sectoral policies that the Union is developing - just think of the effects of the reform of the agricultural policy - should contribute to a great ideal of European cohesion; and that the new idea of European cohesion should also include the flexibility criterion.
One last point, which my colleague Mr Tajani has already touched upon: all these policies will come together in the work of the IGC, confirming the Convention.
Well, I believe a reference to the founding values of Europe, an explicit reference to Christian values, would be a contribution to our history.
Mr President, I have been a Member of this House for 14 years.
In that time, every six months, I get mounds of documents from the incoming presidency telling me about its priorities - but not this time.
I have had nothing.
Yesterday I went to the presidency website - it was the first day of the presidency - to see what its priorities were, and there was a sign saying that nothing would be available until 16.30 hours.
So I thought 'ah, the secrecy is because there is going to be some big announcement'.
I waited with bated breath.
But what we got was the usual warm words.
This suggests to me that the real reason for this delay and the lack of information is simply because this presidency is not ready. That is what concerns me.
When Europe is faced by some of its greatest challenges, such as how to prepare for next year's enlargement, we have a presidency that appears to have been so distracted by internal affairs that it has not properly prepared for its presidency.
I wonder whether this is the worst-prepared presidency of my time in Parliament.
I am also concerned by a lack of consistency.
I will not repeat what Mr Swoboda said, although I agree with it.
However, today we have heard of the presidency's enthusiasm for developing European defence.
I note that this is the very government that rejected the A-400 M, which is, after all, the key element in European defence capability.
That makes me wonder just how many of these warm words will be turned into reality.
I am also concerned by contradictory statements within the government about migration.
We have had some very emotive speeches on this subject.
Quite frankly, we cannot run the important issue of asylum and immigration on knee-jerk rhetoric that only upsets and fuels the anxieties of our population.
We have to show political leadership and a balanced approach, both in looking at the integration of migrants - something that the European Parliament will look at for the first time during this presidency - as well as the management of migration based on our economic needs and the needs of migrants themselves.
I hope the presidency will show exactly that political leadership on this issue.
Mr President, in Italy you often maintain that you are exposed to political persecution by your critics.
That will not happen in this House.
Your work will, however, be scrutinised carefully, for there is no immunity in this House against political blunders and infringements.
This autumn, the EU is to unite around an asylum and immigration policy based upon humanitarianism and shared humanity.
That is something you did not say very much about in your speech, Mr Berlusconi.
Success demands clear leadership that can act with legitimacy and authority.
I must unfortunately ask myself the question as to whether the Italian Government really is capable of shouldering that responsibility today.
One of your own ministers, mentioned earlier in this House, demands that the police use live ammunition upon refugees seeking freedom in your country.
That is something you must now clearly reject.
Your own role as Italian media proprietor has led to the government directing the content of both the private press and of public television.
That is a very worrying development that affects the whole of the EU and that would not have been accepted if it had happened in any of the EU's new Member States.
The gloomy question we now have to ask ourselves is whether Italy is a country that fulfils the political Copenhagen criteria.
May you demonstrate that we critics and sceptics are wrong.
I nonetheless wish you good luck over the next six months.
Mr President, allow me to say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that we have confidence in Italy's Presidency.
We know that you will be able to combine political will and the spirit of conciliation in order to take European integration one stage further.
In international affairs, transatlantic relations are obviously fundamental.
The European Union's discussions with the United States, along the lines of those held recently in Washington, must become more regular.
Issues such as environmental protection that are the subjects of conflict between the two sides of the Atlantic, should be approached on a more pragmatic basis.
We share the opinion of the Italian Presidency on the need for a short IGC, examining, if possible as it stands, the draft constitution of the European Convention and, above all, not re-opening the Pandora's box of national requests.
We are on the verge of adopting a common constitution drawn up in the full light of day.
May we succeed in seizing this unique opportunity, and let us get ready for the new constitutional Treaty of Rome.
Parallel to the enlargement of the EU, people need to feel safe within the borders of an EU alert to the external threats represented by illegal immigration, organised crime and terrorism.
From now on, we need to show the determination required to achieve the desires of the Thessaloniki Council.
At an economic level, the Italian Presidency's plan to give new impetus to the trans-European network of road, rail and sea transport, as well as to the research and development project, is a necessity.
As the French Prime Minister, Mr Raffarin, pointed out, the pact that links Europeans to one another is called the Stability and Growth Pact.
We are therefore in favour of the European Union taking initiatives in the area of growth.
As representative of the overseas regions, I would emphasise the importance, in terms of the EU's social cohesion, of doing everything possible to open up the regions far from the centre of Europe.
European solidarity depends on such efforts.
We can only encourage the new Presidency, in the run-up to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Naples on 2 and 3 December 2003, to develop its relations, particularly in the field of trade, agriculture, infrastructures and migration, in order to ensure that the Barcelona process does not run out of steam.
Finally, we would keenly encourage any European or national policy designed to promote linguistic diversity.
A Europe rich in 20 languages and as many cultures must not be reduced to a Europe of just one language.
That requires effort on the part of everyone, however, and we await practical initiatives in this area from the new Presidency.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I shall let you into a secret: I prefer your own emollient presentation to the contribution, here in Strasbourg yesterday, by the French Prime Minister, whose game was one of national division.
That said - and I imagine you will have realised the fact in the course of this debate - we shall judge you by your actions and not by mere words.
You will also be aware that Parliament has high ambitions for a successful IGC, and it is the task of your presidency to bring it about.
That is the ambition of Parliament and of my political group, in the service of a European democracy that operates at all levels, be it at European level or in each of our Member States, a democracy that respects this Charter of Fundamental Rights that we have just incorporated into the draft Constitution.
I have just, very belatedly, come across your programme in English - I do not, unfortunately, read Italian - and I see that there is again talk of Jacques Delors's White Paper.
I am delighted, because I think Jacques Delors was right.
Since he proposed that the EU undertake this grand project of trans-border networks and European infrastructures, we are, quite simply, coming up against the same problem, namely that of funding.
You raise the idea of funding by the EIB, but the EIB is still just a bank.
You will find no solution other than a European loan.
Are you prepared, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to fight for a European loan to fund this major work?
Otherwise, it will be a case of just words, words, words.
At the end of the day, does this reinvigoration plan serve the cause of European growth or simply that of the Italian economy as it struggles to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact?
Mr President-in-Office, among the points on the agenda for the Italian Presidency, this Parliament has naturally paid particular attention to the Intergovernmental Conference, which should approve the Convention's draft.
The Constitution will be an historic development recalling the 1957 Treaty of Rome.
Parliament, however, expects a step forward on the majority vote and a common foreign policy, which it believes is the only alternative to American unilateralism and the most worthwhile basis for Euro-Atlantic understanding.
I also hope there will be some thought about the fact that human values, which are clearly expressed in the clauses of the Constitution and are there to protect the European citizenry, have Christian roots.
Christianity is no restriction to the secularity of politics.
The Italian Presidency has the opportunity to incorporate the trans-European networks - which the Commission's priority projects have marked out as an objective for strengthening European territorial cohesion - into a broader programme.
We must, however, allocate more resources to the research and innovation policy, as you, Mr Berlusconi, have said and Mr Prodi has confirmed, since the competitiveness of the European economy depends especially on this investment.
This Presidency should, finally, put into practice the initiative outlined at Thessaloniki for an immigration policy that finds a steady balance between legality and reception; that is, one that upholds the values we read of in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
Lastly, to reinvigorate Europe's Mediterranean policy, we must be aware that no initiative involving the southern Mediterranean countries can be successful unless it is based on a strong peace policy that guarantees the security of Israel but also a homeland for the Palestinians.
I wish you success in your work!
Mr President, the Italian Presidency is proposing economic policy initiatives that are interesting and disconcerting at one and the same time.
In fact, the Italian Government seems to be practising a gelato caldo, or 'hot ice', strategy.
It talks in riddles.
The Stability and Growth Pact should thus become both stronger and more flexible at the same time.
There is talk of a 'Maastricht of pensions', a slogan that, at first sight, is devoid of meaning.
President Berlusconi has just invited us to reflect upon the durability of European social welfare.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists is fully aware of the problems at present posed by the contract between the generations.
The fortunate increase in life expectancy, together with shorter working lives, have led to a decrease in the number of people actively employed, as compared with the number of retired people.
That obviously presents a problem of funding for the public systems operating on a distribution basis.
It may be seen, however, how private pension funds operating on a capitalisation basis experience similar problems.
In the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, pension funds are accumulating losses and experiencing serious liquidity problems.
Everywhere, companies are converting the basis of their pensions funds from one of defined benefits to one of defined contributions.
In other words, employees know what they have to pay but are no longer aware of the money to which they will be entitled once they have reached retirement age.
Does not this 'Maastricht of pensions' conceal a desire to reduce the public commitment where pensions are concerned?
The Presidency must clarify its real intentions in this matter as quickly as possible.
The PSE Group will not, at any event, accept a pensions Waterloo.
The proposals by the minister, Mr Tremonti, in favour of trans-European transport systems comply with a political priority defended by my group for years.
As the concept is not very clear and as the funding is by no means assured, it is difficult, however, to see what might be the impact upon the European economic situation of bringing about future trans-European networks.
As President Ciampi said - and I shall conclude at this point - there will be no stability without growth and no growth without stability.
Growth and stability are the two motors that will enable the European economy to move forward.
Mr President, I want to wish the Italian Presidency every success. Taking place, as it is, at an extremely important time for the future of Europe, I want it to be harmonious and effective at one and the same time.
I support what has already been voiced by a number of other speakers, namely the wish to allow a new constitutional treaty to see the light of day during this Presidency.
Italy is a great European country. It is also a country of great Europeans, and I am sure that, faithful to this heritage, the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Commission and the Vice-President of the Convention will be very keen to agree upon essentials in order to give Europe a new face.
This new Constitution that we shall adopt, I hope, by referendum will, as I see it, have one great virtue: that of finally existing.
This fundamental text must, however, be a point of departure for a new Europe and not an end in itself.
I also think that the next elections will be an opportunity for our fellow citizens to affirm their desire to go further in common European policies, whether it is a question of coordinating economic, budgetary, fiscal and social policies, of creating a Europe of defence and research or of defining a common foreign policy that can finally count for something in the world.
That will be the next challenge for those who like this idea of a Europe that both unites and transcends us.
The Italian Presidency will also have a great responsibility for making advances in the fields of education and culture.
You will have to give further impetus to a Europe of knowledge, and I want us to be able to adopt the Erasmus Mundus programme as quickly as possible so that it might be put into effect no later than 2004.
Finally, I would take the liberty of drawing your attention to the meeting of UNESCO's General Assembly in October 2003, which should tackle the draft international convention on cultural diversity.
It is more than desirable that the EU should adopt a clear and public position on this draft.
In conclusion, I want to express the wish that this Italian Presidency might be informed by the spirit of the signatories of the Treaty of Rome.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, our timetable means that it falls to you to hold the Presidency during a six-month period which is key to the implementation of the European arrest warrant, a request of this Parliament, a request of my country, Spain.
I would ask you please to do everything necessary to make it possible.
The European Union must contribute its own approach to the fight against terrorism, particularly since we have seen recently that the military approach has its limitations.
It also has it limitations in relation to the issue of immigration.
Through military means we resolve nothing, and I am not talking about rights, I am talking about effectiveness.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there is nothing easier than to criticise the immigration policy of the current government.
You, Italy, are a clear example.
You attacked the last government on the issue of immigration, and now you are faced with the same or worse problems and you do not even need the opposition to say so: they say it within your own government.
You ask us not to bring Italian arguments here.
Let us make a pact: I would ask you exactly the same thing.
Do not raise the tone by bringing the problems you cannot resolve nationally to the seat of the European Union.
Do not bring the Italian debate on immigration here.
We do not need it.
We do not need an escalation of press headlines.
Instead, we need to continue with the Thessaloniki conclusions, with their content and with the tone in which they have been written.
We need to establish an admission policy, a policy on border control, on integration - a word which has disappeared from your programme - and dialogue with third countries, not on illegal immigration, but on immigration, on all aspects of immigration.
In a measured and rational tone, without mixing up illegality, security and legality, without insinuations which are always at play, not because it is not politically correct, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but because then we would fail in our management of immigration and in the fight against crime and we cannot afford to do that.
Mr President-in-Office, you spoke of a great Europe and, indeed, with the arrival of the new countries, we are experiencing a moment of Europe's reconciliation with its own history and its own civilisation.
Europe will only be great, however, if it can preserve its ability to compete in the economic field.
As you said, Europe will be able to exert influence if it can act decisively.
If, today, there is a ghost haunting Europe, it is the risk of losing its competitive ability on a world scale.
I therefore applaud your mention of the Lisbon strategy and also the reference in your programme to competitiveness in the service of shared prosperity.
Since Lisbon, Mr President-in-Office, three years have been wasted - and I mean wasted.
That is why it is right to seek new lines of development and new economic instruments, as you have done.
We need imagination, we need the ability to see beyond what is obvious, and therefore the proposal to build up our infrastructure, both tangible and intangible (such as human resources and research), by mobilising private resources as well as public funds is the right road.
It is also necessary to bring the subject of a sustainable pensions system to European Union level.
Many of us, in this Parliament and outside, are convinced that your Presidency will be the key to success in this critical period in the construction of a united Europe.
I should like to remind those who today have brought us the venom of a certain mediocre kind of Italian politics that in a democracy it is the citizens' votes that give legitimacy, and nothing else.
Perhaps for them the concept of democracy is too recent for them to have adopted it completely.
We, as Italians and Europeans, are proud that you are going to lead Europe for these six months.
I wish you every success in your work, Mr President-in-Office!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, the Italian Presidency's programme is not really available.
I had to download it from the web and read it in English this morning.
Fortunately, I understand English, but I regret that I do not understand Italian.
But I would not have needed very much English to read what I found in your programme about environmental policy, because there was not really anything to read.
You said a few nice friendly things that could easily have been copied from a daily paper.
As you referred to the Lisbon process, I would like to ask you, Mr President-in-Office, whether you are aware that the Lisbon process calls for sustainability and environmental measures to be incorporated into all other areas of policy?
If you are aware of that, could you please tell me how you intend to achieve it?
I would also be grateful if you could confirm that your government has issued a paper entitled Environment as an Opportunity, which envisages that the Italian Presidency should use these six months to limit EU environmental legislation and downgrade it.
If that is correct, Mr Berlusconi, I presume that you will have the paper pulped immediately and condemn it as being illegal.
I would also be grateful if you could tell me whether you will use your presidency to ensure that existing EU legislation is transposed into Italian law, as in the case of environmental impact assessment, for instance.
I would be grateful if you could tell us, Mr Berlusconi, whether people who do not comply with that legislation will be the subject of criminal prosecution, because non-compliance is an offence, and I also call on the Commission to take appropriate action if it is aware of such non-compliance.
Lastly, Mr Berlusconi, I would be grateful if you could tell me if during your presidency you will also be pursuing the environmental legislation for which you will be responsible, and in particular whether environmental responsibility will be on the agenda during your presidency.
I would be grateful if you could explain how you intend to take that forward.
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the House for allowing the President-in-Office to present his important message uninterrupted.
I am a great Italophile and a friend of Alleanza nazionale and of Forza Italia in Parliament.
Mr Berlusconi wisely refers positively to the wider European debate.
I agree, and I welcome strengthening the links with Ukraine and Moldova in particular.
I would ask for a formal acknowledgement for the first time that under Article 49 of the Treaty they are entitled to apply for eventual EU membership.
Nevertheless, the absence in Chisinau of a European Commission delegation and the fact that Italy, unlike Britain, France and Germany, does not have an embassy in Moldova - in spite of links with the Romanian-speaking peoples - is regrettable.
Pressure must be brought to finally resolve the Transnistrian question, which truncates and corrupts the Moldovan state.
The regime recently snubbed a delegation of MEPs from this House from entering the occupied territory.
Pressure on Russia and Ukraine would help solve this matter.
It is important also that the EU engages constructively with Belarus where, notwithstanding our differences, we must engage positively in areas of mutual interest, like border controls, and in order to encourage reforms and democracy and discourage self-isolation by that government.
I call upon the Council to grant a political mandate to the EIB for the first time to extend its operations to Ukraine and Moldova in expectation of their eventual EU candidatures.
After all, the EIB is already active in Russia, where I, of course, welcome Mr Berlusconi's interest and engagement.
I applaud the beefing up of the trans-European networks and a good start would be for a fast train between Brussels and Strasbourg to make our lives as MEPs much more bearable.
I also welcome the reinvigoration of the Lisbon Agenda, without which our continent will lose out to the emerging markets of the East and the proposed free-trade areas of the Americas.
Lastly, I welcome Italy's efforts to robustly secure Europe's southern frontiers against illegal immigration.
However, how can this be reconciled with the Commission's communication on a wider Europe, which seems to controversially promise eventual freedom of movement to people from the Euro-Med partnership countries?
Mr President-in-Office, I, like everybody else in this House, would like to wish the Italian Presidency success over the next six months.
There is important work to be done and I am hopeful that, despite the concerns that many of us have with regard to your exercise of power in Italy, the European agenda will be advanced.
The judgment that this House will make in relation to your work as President-in-Office will be based on how well you advance the European agenda.
Other matters will be dealt with in the fullness of time by the Italian electorate and presumably also the Italian courts.
However, in terms of what we must do now, the most important issue that you must address is the Intergovernmental Conference.
It is essential that the Intergovernmental Conference is not allowed to withdraw into the shadows.
The Convention on the Future of Europe has met in public, has debated in public, all the issues have been thrashed out in public.
Unelected diplomats should not be allowed to withdraw behind closed doors to dismantle the good work of the Convention.
It is therefore an extremely important responsibility of your presidency to ensure that the documentation of the Intergovernmental Conference is made available in public, as well as all responses to that documentation.
It is not enough simply to have occasional, carefully-edited reports presented to this House every now and then over the next six months.
We need to know exactly what is going on.
The public needs to know, the national parliaments need to know and the European Parliament needs to know the debate that is going on in the Intergovernmental Conference.
We cannot ensure the support of the electorate of Europe for the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference unless people are fully engaged in the debate that takes place there.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, two golden rules have emerged from Mr Berlusconi's speech: continuity in foreign policy and security, and a call for judgment based on the facts.
The approach of negotiation announced by Mr Berlusconi is the approach of wisdom and true hard work, the approach that Europe needs in everyone's interests.
The facts speak for themselves: Europe is at an historic turning-point, it is about to give itself a constitution, but the draft presented has received general acceptance which for the time being, however, has glossed over the objections of several governments, and these objections will surface at the Intergovernmental Conference.
Negotiation will be the only means of reaching a positive conclusion.
In foreign policy there are four objectives: the Middle East peace process; restoring the transatlantic relationship, which has been damaged by the Iraqi crisis; launching new operations in the Balkans run by European forces under the European flag; and lastly the dialogue with the southern Mediterranean countries, which is one of the strong points in the line of action of the European Commission, under the excellent leadership of Romano Prodi.
In these cases too, the negotiation you have indicated, Mr President-in-Office, will be decisive.
Since your first appearance in this House, you needed to clarify not only the priorities of the Italian Presidency but also the methods it intended to use, and you have done so clearly, coherently and with a sense of true democracy, especially when you announced greater involvement for the European Parliament.
Finally, we appreciate the commitment to boost the Union's economy and define the future of the common agricultural policy, and highlight your spirit of collaboration on thorny problems like immigration and the security policy.
I should like to end by expressing my pride as an Italian Member of this Parliament - a feeling that any other European Member would feel in these circumstances - at taking part in a founding action of the European Union, a Union which is today led by two Italian representatives, Silvio Berlusconi and Romano Prodi.
We are certain they will not disappoint us but will, instead, prove worthy of Italy's history and the creation of the Community.
Mr Berlusconi, your Presidency will be successful, despite the Italian and European malcontents who rant and rail today, and you will have the full support of the Christian Democrat group in this Parliament.
I wish you success, as this will be the success of Europe!
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Italian Presidency of the European Union begins in a climate of complex and difficult economic choices.
If this Presidency is to be successful, the period of euroscepticism which only a little while ago led the Italian Government to voice reservations about the single currency must be completely left behind.
In the meantime, the aim that the Italian Presidency has made its priority should from now on be acknowledged as a positive one. That objective is to reinvigorate the European economy, which is currently stagnant and appears overly-dependent on the recovery of the US economy.
It is therefore important to acquire detailed knowledge of the new Presidency's concrete proposals, from the launch of a broad-based programme of investment in infrastructure, backed by the European Investment Bank (EIB), to a reopening of the debate on the flexibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, which forces European economies into a strait-jacket of budgetary constraints, even when, as now, their growth rates are negative or very close to zero.
This Presidency, regardless of who happens to be at the helm, can only succeed fully if everyone shares the desire for European integration to succeed.
I wish the President success.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, it is unfortunate that the Italian Presidency's programme of work in the field of transport, as it stands, contains two major omissions. The first is to expedite and complete the conciliation procedure on the second rail package, and the second is the conciliation procedure on the ports directive.
As European Parliament rapporteur, I appeal to the Italian Presidency to give priority to these two legislative proposals, since promoting rail transport and ports could well be in Italy's national interest also.
The Italian Government in particular could have a great interest in the further gradual opening up of rail networks, thus revitalising the rail sector and shifting more goods and passengers from road to rail.
As Parliament's rapporteur, I wish to offer the presidency an early conciliation procedure in the context of the second reading in Parliament, so that we can complete the second rail package by the end of the Italian Presidency.
Increasing the efficiency of port services by means of increased competition and transparency could, however, also be in the interest of the Union as a whole, as well as of Italy with its long coastline and its pivotal role in the Mediterranean.
That is why I hope that the Italian Presidency will take this conciliation procedure seriously and accept it as a priority.
Mr President-in-Office, I would like to take the liberty of calling on you, as a former member of our group and as a friend of our group, to help us in expediting these two important transport projects, that is opening up rail networks and opening up port services to increased competition and greater efficiency, by working quickly and effectively with us.
Thank you very much!
Mr President-in-Office, as I have the fortune to take the floor at the end of this debate, I should first of all like to express my satisfaction as an Italian at the recognition, shown by so many, of the historic role played by Italy in the process of European integration: a role, I may add, that has always given particular value to those original supranational institutions, the European Commission and the European Parliament.
I am sure, Mr Berlusconi, that you, as an Italian, will share this satisfaction and understand that any reservations, concerns and demands directed at you reflect everyone's expectations for the Presidency of a great founding and federating country of the European Community.
I shall now express my concerns and expectations as Chairman of the Committee for Constitutional Affairs.
The Convention on the future of Europe has been an innovation of extraordinary importance.
The draft Constitution it has adopted will certainly be referred, under the Treaty, for final decisions by the Heads of State and Government, but it would be foolish to call into question the most significant innovations in it after sixteen months of hard work put in by the representatives from the governments, the national parliaments and the European Parliament.
You, Mr Berlusconi, have talked about differences of opinion and hence the need for negotiation, but significant efforts at negotiation have already been made in the Convention, and in its Praesidium in particular.
Negotiation by the Italian Presidency in the preparation and running of the Intergovernmental Conference must aim at further advancement of the draft Constitution, clearly addressing those essential options that have remained unresolved, which the President of the Commission pointed out today and also yesterday morning in this House.
Parliament fully agrees with the Commission's recommendations.
We are shortly going to vote here on a resolution tabled by members of the PPE-DE, PSE and ELDR Groups, calling for a courageous formulation of Parts III and IV of the Constitution and, in particular, further extension of qualified majority voting.
As Parliament, we shall make our contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference in the ways that have been indicated by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and that you have undertaken to propose to the Council.
I too naturally welcome the way you have taken a position and I hope it will be extended to the other aspects suggested by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
I hope, Mr Berlusconi, you will look upon the dialogue with our Parliament dispassionately and with an open mind.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I sincerely welcome the Italian Presidency's programme and believe that, with the necessary caution, with the humility that marks the Italian people and with the almost unique ability to place our inspiration and intelligence at the service of the many, we shall be able to make port in the new Europe.
The true aim of politics must be the noble government of people's needs, in a society that is constantly changing at an ever-increasing rate.
To do this one needs great political sensitivity to manage the technostructure and oppose technocracy.
The society governed in this way consists, in simple terms, of a vast majority of ordinary, good, simple people: men, women, young, old, children, of varying abilities, who work and live anonymously but are driven by good and simple feelings of solidarity and love.
This is the important Europe that we have to address, by moulding the economic structure to the growth of these ordinary people, who should not have to live with the insecurity and instability in which the globalised economy would trap them.
The Euro-Atlantic partnership with all the Americas is not just an economic and political need or choice; it is a cultural fact that arises from our common roots and shared values.
It should be strengthened, it must grow, not least through the transformation of NATO into a tool of international policing at the service of a reformed United Nations, going beyond the rationale of Yalta.
A last thought concerns world poverty.
There is too much poverty, and it requires aid.
Therefore, in the discussion on the Union's financial perspective, we should boldly and decisively set ourselves the target of increasing our contribution to 2% of GDP, because opening up our markets and reforming our institutions is not enough for the international agencies.
Mr President-in-Office, I hope our Italian Presidency will have a very great ability to listen, because that is the only way it will be able to celebrate the Constitution of the new Europe, and also to satisfy the Commission under Romano Prodi, a staunch champion of the Community method and of the Europe we want.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, many Members have highlighted the extraordinary nature of the events and turning-points of European politics that will occur during your Presidency, from the Constitutional Treaty to the Middle East roadmap, the preparations for enlargement and the relaunch of the Lisbon strategy.
I certainly mean to recognise the historic importance of these events, but I should like to call your attention, Mr President-in-Office, to the very ordinary nature of the work done by the European institutions.
We need to make step-by-step progress on many important files, and I refer in particular to the traffic and transport sector, which Mr Jarzembowski has already mentioned.
This sector is in a happy situation, with the arrival of the Van Miert proposal, which has finally given us a new programme of new projects that are equal to the challenges facing us as a continent; your government's proposal of an ingenious way to finance these projects; and the Commission's proposal to increase European funding to 20%.
This is certainly a scenario with significant possibilities, but we have to round it off, Mr President-in-Office.
The Council has been a little remiss in the matter of liberalising port services, in the matter of the railway package and as regards the thorny, age-old problem of the Alpine passes.
Tomorrow, Parliament will be voting for the umpteenth time on a call to shelve the ecopoints idea, and I hope this time the Council will agree to follow our lead.
Then there is the air sector, and the maritime safety sector.
Just an example, then, Mr President-in-Office, to remind you of the commitment which, I am sure, your presidency will be ready to demonstrate in these areas, particularly because every time we manage to make some progress with these files we shall be showing our fellow European citizens tangible proof that Europe offers greater opportunities, well-being and prosperity for all.
Mr President-in-Office, the vulgar and tendentious attacks by certain elements of the foreign press - and some Italian elements too, I have to admit - which have been echoed in this House in some Members' speeches and then in that pathetic demonstration, have given the start of this Italian Presidency an unnecessarily polemic tone.
Paradoxically, I believe all of this is a good sign, Mr Berlusconi: remember that malice of this kind was loudly voiced in 2001 and only contributed to your resounding victory in those elections.
I should like to hope that, after all this initial noise, the success of the Italian Presidency will be judged not on the private affairs of Mr Berlusconi the citizen or on your conflict of interests - which you are trying to resolve and I hope will resolve soon - but on your ability to impart that much-needed leadership and impetus to the construction of Europe, and today's programme speech was an excellent first step in that direction.
As a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am sure that in this area, the area that concerns me, some problems can be resolved, such as mending the damaged relations with the United States.
Progress will be made on other issues, such as the Middle East, where Italy has already shown great diplomatic skill, or the assimilation of the new countries that are about to join, who quite rightly see in Mr Berlusconi a defender of their interests and their principles, a political leader who, unlike others, has understood that there is no contradiction between European commitment and Atlantic solidarity.
Having said that, Mr Berlusconi, I believe your task remains a difficult one, because there will be no concessions for you: every decision, every gesture you make will be subjected to close appraisal and scrutiny, and you will not be forgiven for any false move.
However, this is not the first time you have undergone this kind of examination: good luck, Mr Berlusconi!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, constitutional reform and economic reforms in Europe today are merely two sides of the same coin.
Competitiveness, social cohesion, solidarity across generations, the valuing of human resources, solidarity towards the countries in the many southern parts of the world are not just many objectives within our reach, but they are also the founding values of the best episodes in our peoples' histories.
Today, we are faced with a great opportunity: to combine the constitutional process with the will and the need for reform - reform as the steady, day-to-day implementation of that work in progress that is, and will be, our formal Constitution.
The conditions, both positive and negative, are all there to be turned into opportunities: an integrated internal market, as Mr Prodi has mentioned, the largest and richest in the world; low interest rates, but also - a negative point that can be turned into an opportunity - still high unemployment; job markets that are still too inflexible; and insufficient infrastructure.
The action plan you have proposed, Mr President-in-Office, for developing the great trans-European infrastructure networks through public and private investment, is a step in this direction.
As is well known, investment in infrastructure produces higher returns through Keynes's multiplier, greater competitiveness, and more economic and social cohesion in the north, south, east and west.
The same may be said for the objective of making our welfare systems sustainable through reform, not by taking away but by giving more with fairness (not least to our children), guarantees and security.
Infrastructure investment and welfare reform, however, require an efficient, flexible, well-structured labour market that is well regulated and fairer.
Mr President-in-Office, you won the Italian elections with a modernising programme, just as the programme you have presented today is modernising.
There is no doubt that you will carry them both through.
I wish you good luck and success in your work.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, mine is the last speech and therefore in some way also the most confused.
My confusion has been caused to a great extent by the acumen of some of the speeches that came before.
I no longer know whether the President-in-Office will preside over the IGC in Rome in the fullness of his prerogatives or whether, as Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo claims, he will be an occasional guest of the mayor of that city.
Most of all, however, I no longer know whether the epithet 'human atom bomb' should be applied, as it has been historically, to the unforgettable Rita Hayworth, or whether it should be transferred, as Mrs Frassoni would have it, to Vice-President Fini.
Therefore, in order to set my values straight, I have decided to make a dull but clear speech, something along the lines of 'God, country and family', hinging on the subject of Europe's Christian roots, which is not an ideological subject but one of democratic procedures.
Indeed, this reference is not a contribution to the clerical concerns of certain social groups but the historical memory of the truest meaning behind our institutions.
Our democratic institutions are in fact the result of a freedom pact with the citizens, who transfer some of their own sovereignty to them in exchange for guarantees and services.
From this viewpoint, the states and especially the supranational institutions, are guarantors of the attempts that we citizens make to respond to our needs - they are guarantors, not masters - and they are such because they are well aware that they cannot be the final answer to people's heartfelt desires.
The reference to Europe's Christian roots merely shows that today's Europe realises that, without its bond with the uniting and personalistic tension of Christianity, it will always be weaker, more exposed to the political short cuts of totalitarian regimes. To be able to reject humanity to the utmost, such regimes have always preferred to begin by rejecting God, though for less explicit reasons than the politically correct of today.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Poettering for his words of support, encouragement and best wishes, and all the Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats who, in their speeches, have made demands of us on one point or another but who have shown us a token of the support that they will give us in these busy months to come.
I also thank the Chairman of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reformist Party and extend my thanks to the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, who expressed his critical demands with great courtesy and also a subtle sense of humour.
I should like to tell him that I am still convinced that the great Europe of the future, if it genuinely wants to be a leader in world politics able to sit at a table on equal terms with the United States, will have to be a great Europe that can also include Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Israel, the Russian Federation and its military strength.
This is certainly a vision that the Prime Minister of Italy has, and one that he can, of course, express quite freely when speaking for himself and for his government, but when the Prime Minister becomes the President-in-Office of the European Council he has to adhere to the prevailing opinion within the European Council, and it is therefore clear that what he says and the activities to which he must devote himself have of necessity to reflect the mandate he is given by his fellow members of the Council.
(Applause from the right)
I also want to respond to that other witticism, that a dyed-in-the-wool liberal has at last adopted a doctrine that forms part of socialist thinking, that is, Keynesianism.
I agree with you, sir, that one might find a Keynesian or Colbertian flavour in the request for European intervention through the EIB and the raising of private capital in order to realise major trans-European infrastructure, which were proposed as much as ten years ago by Mr Delors, but, you see, we are faced by a fact that nobody can deny.
What has happened in the world since 11 September?
There has been the war in Afghanistan, there has been the war in Iraq, but, above all, the world stock markets have crashed.
This has caused a reduction in all the financial assets invested in shareholdings and has caused a critical cut in all their returns.
If you used to have assets worth 100, you now have assets worth 35; if you used to get a return of 8 or 10% on your assets, you now get a return of 1%.
This has led to a reduction in private-sector demand on the market for consumer goods and high-value consumer goods, and, therefore, when private-sector demand falls, when consumption falls, there is nothing one can do but call on public-sector demand to sustain the economy.
This public-sector demand cannot come from individual Member States, because the individual states can no longer develop a monetary policy because there is the euro, they cannot change exchange rates, and they cannot create a development policy, for the simple reason that they have to keep within the Maastricht parameters.
Thus, it is Europe alone that must, at last, create its own economic policy capability.
Italy's proposal is that Europe, through one of its institutions, the EIB, should raise those private capital funds that are on the market and can be had at low interest rates, in order to try to boost demand through transnational infrastructure works, through the need to invest in new military technology, and through investment in research and education.
The fact that we are faced with an economic situation that has changed is the only justification for resorting to state investment and, in this case, European Union investment.
(Applause from the right)
I shall also, if I may, answer that point you put to me when you said, 'I hope Mr Berlusconi's Italian flair for making laws just for specific cases that are, perhaps, somehow of close interest to him will not be extended to the European level.'
I should like to quote you some figures to remind you that my government, which is Italy's fifty-seventh in 50 years and has the responsibility - and also the opportunity, seeing that it has a large majority in both sections of parliament - to work for five years, is putting 24 different reforms into practice.
In fact, it inherited a country in which none of the previous governments, which were only able to work for less than five years on average, was, of course, able to do this.
I remind you that my government has drafted a record three hundred and fifty bills and decree-laws, two hundred of which have already been passed by our majority in parliament.
Therefore, while I do not admit you are right, I can say that those three bills were a response - using a democratic method, a parliamentary vote - to a person who takes advantage of their position as an officer of justice to use the courts to attack their political enemies; although I believe that this has happened, it has only happened in three cases out of 350: 1%, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
I confirm, however - God forgive you if you did not know - that we shall be keeping Members of Parliament and Parliament itself informed on the progress of our negotiation operation, which it will not be at all easy to complete in the short time available.
We shall be using the time between now and about 15 October to contact the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of all the other 24 European Union Member States so that, at the opening of the Conference, we can already present some possible solutions on which everyone can agree.
I would, of course, also like to thank the other Members who have spoken - Mr Graham Watson, Mrs Monica Frassoni, Mr Francis Wurtz - for wishing me success in my work.
I must, however, reply to them and to all those who have given an utterly distorted view of Italy that is far from the truth.
I invite them to come and enjoy something that the Berlusconi government has clearly not succeeded in eliminating, which is Italy's sunshine, its beauty, its 100 000 monuments and churches, our 3 500 museums, our 2 500 archaeological sites, the 40 000 historical houses in Italy, which we have not managed to destroy over the last two years.
Mr Schultz, I know there is a producer in Italy who is making a film about Nazi concentration camps. I will suggest you for the role of guard.
You would be perfect!
(Laughter, protests from the left)
I shall conclude this diatribe by saying that my Social Democrat friends and colleagues should probably expand their acquaintances beyond the Italian Members they find here in Parliament and they should perhaps extend their reading beyond the far left newspapers, which have evidently shaped these convictions of theirs.
I should also like to reply to Mr Pannella, who made a point about the personal line that I have consistently followed, and which I still believe in, with regard to Israel - which I mentioned a moment ago - and Turkey.
I must tell him as well that, in the coming six months, I must expound the line of the European Council; after that I shall have the opportunity, within the European Council, to uphold these views of mine, which are, of course, not views for the next six months or that can be realised in one term of office but visions that will require much longer to come to fruition.
I can reassure him, however, as regards the moratorium on the death penalty.
I have always upheld the need for this intervention, and I shall therefore certainly take this demand to the United Nations Assembly in September as a demand from the European Parliament too.
(Applause from the right)
Another thing that has been ascribed to me is subservience to the United States.
I have recalled several times that I see Europe as a joint protagonist in maintaining security and peace, for the development of well-being throughout the world, but to do this Europe must not be just an economic giant but an economic giant that can also find a way to express itself with a single voice on foreign policy, and one that can also invest more in its military forces.
No diplomacy, no policy in history has ever been successful without the support of adequate military strength.
With regard to the United States, I think we should be friends of the United States, but I do not believe there has been anything in the Italian Government's conduct that could be seen as subservience.
I repeatedly tried to dissuade the person who has been mentioned here as being my friend, President George Bush, from launching a military initiative in Iraq.
I did not succeed, and then I insisted - even signing that letter with seven other European Union Member States, to which 10 other countries were then added, including, first and foremost, some of the new Members of the European Union - that one evil, the war in Iraq, should not be followed by other evils, and particularly that it should not be followed by the discrediting of the United Nations, which I regret to say did happen since it was shown to be impotent, or by the crisis in transatlantic relations, which did happen; or by the final evil, which is the division among the countries of Europe, something which did happen and which we are all endeavouring to put right and overcome together.
Regarding the conflict of interests which many have mentioned: well, perhaps you are not aware that, in Italy, the newspapers and the television channels that still belong to my group and my family, especially, are among our strongest critics.
Why?
Clearly, you have not experienced Italy's sunshine; you have never been to Italy and you have never tuned into an Italian television channel.
You ought to know - and yet many of you have a background in journalism - that the greatest concern of all journalists is to appear independent to their colleagues.
This independence leads them to be constantly critical towards the one they consider the boss.
If this is the kind of democracy you mean to use to silence the President-in-Office of the European Council, I can tell you that you should come to Italy as tourists, because you look like democracy tourists here.
(Uproar on the left)
I was leader of the opposition in Italy for six years, so these speeches do not frighten me: I am used to being contradicted.
On immigration, I should like to remind you that, if there is one country that is rooted in Christianity, a generous country, open to those who have the least and to those who suffer, I am proud to say that this country is mine, Italy.
Let us not, therefore, confuse the war we must all wage together against the traffickers of slaves, the new slave trade, with the welcome we must give to those who come to improve their lives on the continent of Europe.
We give them this welcome, and we give it generously.
We want to fight this new form of slavery which is emerging through numerous international organisations: no more than that, and there is nothing in that which might cast doubt on Italy's generosity.
Regarding the environment, perhaps the Greens are not aware that Mr Berlusconi's favourite hobby is to do with flowers, nature, gardens and parks.
It has been practically my only hobby since football left me behind.
If you read page 49 of our programme, Mrs Frassoni, you will find that we want to introduce high levels of environmental protection; our policy, over and above the way it is being misrepresented, is directed precisely towards greater protection of the environment, and we are the first to be puzzled by the fact that, all too often, the expansion of production and industry has been to the detriment of the environment.
In relation to the implementation of the Kyoto protocol, here too we shall take steps to convince those who have not signed it to do so.
Finally, I should like to say to my adversaries, with a smile, that they should not make a tragedy out of our Presidency. when all is said and done, six months pass very quickly.
To my friends, however, those who have encouraged us and will continue to encourage us, I should like to say that, with regard to a man's past and the man himself, I believe the important thing is not just what he says - in politics, very often, one changes, or other people change, the things one says - but his record, what he has done.
Well, I believe that there are only successes in my record and only good intentions behind my actions.
Therefore, we shall also make these six months bear fruit and try to reach a conclusion that enables Europe to be a positive factor for world peace, security and prosperity.
We shall apply ourselves to our work, Mr President, with humility, dedication and conviction; we shall apply ourselves to brokering a solution from the various, still widely differing positions of the different Member States, that will give us a stronger Europe, able to make decisions on the international stage; that will give us a Europe through the new Constitution, a Europe that is closer to its citizens.
This is our hope; this is our undertaking; this is our goal.
I thank you again for your good wishes for our work, and I wish you all every success in your work. May you succeed in making all your heartfelt hopes reality.
My best wishes to all of you and, once again, good luck with your work!
(Applause from the right, uproar on the left)
In the course of Mr Berlusconi's vigorous and colourful response to the debate, a remark was made in respect of one of our colleagues, Mr Schulz, who, under the Rules of Procedure, is entitled to make a statement to the House if he so wishes.
I would like to make that quite clear before I invite President Prodi to speak.
What I will do first, following procedure, is hear President Prodi and then, if he wishes, I will invite Mr Schulz to make a personal statement at the end of the debate, as provided for under Rule 122.
I am speaking to ask you, as President, to protect the rights of the Members, in particular the honour of Mr Schulz.
You have made a proposal.
I would ask you, as well as giving the floor to Mr Schulz, to call on Mr Berlusconi, the President-in-Office of the Council, to withdraw those comments, out of respect for the values we all share as Europeans.
(Applause)
It is perhaps better that we should deal with this matter directly.
I do not want to open up a whole debate.
There is considerable emotion in the House regarding this.
It is very clear that a Member is entitled to make a contribution in a debate and to have it responded to with some serenity.
In this case, in the vigour and flow of his response, Mr Berlusconi perhaps allowed himself to go beyond the ordinary rules of engagement.
(Mixed reactions)
I will first hear Mr Schulz, who is entitled to speak, and then I shall return to the President-in-Office of the Council, if he wishes to respond.
We will close the debate after hearing Mr Prodi.
Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor.
I do not need three minutes. I will be very brief.
During his statement, if the translation was correct, Mr Berlusconi said that a director is currently shooting a film in Italy about the concentration camps, and was inviting me to take the role of the Kapo ?
? that is to say, the role of the SS henchman. I have only one thing to say to you in response: my respect for the victims of fascism prevents me from saying a single word about this.
However, I am quite clear in my mind that it is very difficult to accept a situation in which a President-in-Office of the Council, when he comes up against the slightest contradiction during a debate, loses his composure in this way.
(Loud and sustained applause from the left and centre left)
(Standing ovation)
Mr President, who was not in the Chamber to hear Mr Schulz's speech?
That he should insult me seriously on a personal level, gesticulating and in a tone of voice that really is unacceptable in a Parliament like this.
I said what I said ironically.
If you are all unable to understand irony, I am sorry.
But I will not withdraw what I said ironically unless Mr Schulz withdraws the personal insults he made.
I said it ironically; he did that maliciously!
(Applause from the right, uproar on the left)
Colleagues! Please, could we have some calm!
There are many colleagues who wish to make points of order and to speak.
We are running very late. I will not take those points.
I wish to say, as President of the House, that I personally regret the tone that the latter part of this morning's debate has taken.
It is unfortunate.
It is a distraction from the European business we have in hand.
It is regrettable.
I should now like to invite the President of the European Commission to close this debate in some serenity and then to proceed to the vote.
(Sustained applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Members of Parliament, this morning's debate has most of all highlighted the extent of the tasks and difficulties of the six months that lie ahead: six months of crucial importance for the great initiatives that must be completed and the new paths that are to be opened up.
The objective that stands out above all others is the Intergovernmental Conference, which is to give us a Constitution that should not only contain an architecture for our institutions but also constitute a set of visions, values and models of society.
We expect a lot from the Italian Presidency, because this is our great challenge and because this Constitution will dictate the rules of this Europe of ours for a long time to come.
The line of action should lead on from the Greek Presidency, but with certain particularly significant moments.
At these moments the Commission will carry out its mandate - a mandate that is not only executive but also one of instigation and proposal - I repeat, leading on in terms of the policies and collaboration that we have built up over these years together with the European Parliament and the various Presidencies.
The Commission must be the guarantor of this continuity and it will encourage and help the Italian Presidency to move with us in the same direction.
The debate focused precisely on these major problems, and the Commission will put these objectives into practice and carry them out using its institutional methods for representing and promoting the Union's interests.
In what fields?
We shall do so in the field of institutional reform, as we have said, in the drive for economic revitalisation, for the normalisation of friendly relations with the United States in a position of dignity and equality; we shall do so by furthering and speeding up the difficult, complicated process of the accession of the Balkan countries into Europe and with the gradual achievement of the project of the ring of friendly countries, thus putting our vision into practice.
Here, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to recall the debate which has run all this year, focusing on the borders of Europe: a difficult and complicated debate which, you will recall, it was impossible to commence at the beginning of the legislative period, and which looks towards the completion of our Union with the candidate countries, with the addition of the Balkan countries, and looks towards the construction around them of strong, close and friendly relations with the surrounding countries, from Russia to Morocco, with whom we must share everything save our institutions, since our Union must have its own borders, its own strength and its own depth.
We shall do so by furthering our work on the security of our citizens, and on the rules for and rights of emigrants.
I should like to dwell just a little more on some of the points I have listed because I consider them key points for our future work.
Firstly, I must assure you all that we shall always be true and strict guardians of compliance with the Treaties and the new Constitution.
Secondly, we shall strongly support the balanced development of our society.
The Lisbon process, which has emerged today as a strong point, is our point of reference, because Europe must overcome the worldwide challenge, but it must overcome it through balanced and socially sustainable development.
The increasing differences between the citizens of the various European countries in almost all our nations over the last decade concerns me at least as much as the lack of growth.
At this historic moment, we cannot throw social dialogue and consultation out of the window, since these are the pillars of the European social model on which we have laboured so hard in recent years.
With regard to infrastructure, we have already underlined our new undertaking and it will be our responsibility and duty to be rigorous and selective in assessing the costs and benefits, and just as rigorous in finding sources of finance that are compatible with our rules and with long-term sustainability.
We are working on this side by side with the European Investment Bank, and we shall be making the same effort in the field of research, without which Europe will be a lost continent.
With regard to immigration, the Commission will be supporting a European undertaking to combat the new slave traders, but we shall not tolerate, as happened at Thessaloniki, people confusing firmness with inhumanity, or regulation of migration flows with violence and discrimination.
With regard to international relations, lastly, the Commission maintains its commitment to peace and a multilateral approach to resolving conflicts.
Moreover, the Union's humanitarian commitment will continue to provide the long-term aid that is by far the greatest priority to every country in the world.
These are the guidelines for the coming six months.
I believe it will be a period of cooperation and a period which, with the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, will genuinely open a new chapter in the history of Europe.
(Applause)
I know that many colleagues wish to speak, but we have considerably run over our time.
Before closing this debate and handing over to one of the Vice-Presidents to conduct the vote, I should like to say that personally I regret the offence caused to our respected Member and colleague, Mr Schulz.
(Loud applause)
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)
The Italian Presidency has cited immigration policy and the fight against illegal immigration as being among its priorities, and we assure it of our support.
We hope, in particular, that it will prove to be clearer and more resolute than the Thessaloniki Council, held two weeks ago.
Although it devoted a large proportion of its conclusions to immigration policy - seven and a half pages, compared with the one and a half that came out of the Convention - the Council was particularly obscure, even impossible to understand, defining, in particular, its objective in terms of a 'two-way process', aimed at simultaneously fighting illegal immigration and exploring 'legal migration channels'.
Europe now needs a clear, firm policy for controlling its borders, returning illegal immigrants to their own countries and reforming the right of asylum in order to put an end to abuses.
On this subject, we are sorry that the Thessaloniki Council did not really deal with the British demand that transit centres be created, responsible for examining asylum requests at the EU's external borders, together with 'regional protection zones' close to the countries of origin of those requesting asylum.
We are relying upon the Italian Presidency to make progress on this issue.
Mr President, if I have observed correctly, you have not yet taken a vote on Amendment No 75 tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats.
This amendment needs to be voted on before all the other amendments, because the objective is to reject the Council's common position.
Mr President, I wish to table an oral amendment whereby the word 'European' would be omitted so that both national and international labels could be used.
This would correspond to what we decided under Amendment No 32, whereby we can still use all the labels, and it applies to both Amendment No 88 and Amendment No 89.
In other words, I am tabling an oral amendment designed to remove the word 'European'.
Mr President, I hope you will hear me out.
I, like the other Members still present, am one of those who stay on until the conclusion of a vote like this. Others have long since left the building.
I would like to say, without mincing my words, that those who really work should not be penalised because others pack their bags on Thursday morning!
As the rapporteur states, the directive on the prospectus is a central plank in the Financial Services Action Plan, an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy, which aims to integrate financial markets by 2005.
One can therefore understand why the rapporteur believes that it is 'vital to reach consensus and ensure a rapid adoption of the directive', since 'the creation of a legal framework which enhances the conditions for raising of capital via Europe's financial markets' depends on it.
In other words, as well as ensuring the refinancing of (large) companies, the directive is intended to encourage greater liberalisation of investment and capital.
From this perspective, the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the Council common position aim to make regulations more flexible, to speed up the procedure for approving the prospectus and reduce the scope for independent decision-making by Member States and national legislations.
Specifically, States' power to define who may be considered a qualified investor and to shorten approval periods has been curtailed by the introduction of the concept of deemed approval.
The directive also finds the provision for the competent authority to carry out on-site inspections to monitor compliance with the directive to be disproportionate.
It even wants to raise the investor threshold below which there will be no obligation to publish a prospectus.
In short, it wants to liberalise.
That is why we voted against it.
I largely share the rapporteur's concern to enhance the conditions for raising of capital via Europe's financial markets.
I feel that the transparency and clarity of these markets, which will result from the process of simplification set out in this report, are reason enough to justify minimal levels of Community regulation in this sector.
These measures may contribute to the creation of a legal framework which strengthens and facilitates the raising of capital via Europe's financial markets and improves disclosure standards for investors. This will benefit issuers, investors, operators and the markets themselves.
I note the rapporteur's sensitivity to the need for a loosening of certain regulations in order to adapt the legislation to the demands and fluctuations of the market and to reduce the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises.
In particular, he would like to see the requirement for a 'register' of bodies recognised as qualified investors waived, and small regional banks to be permitted to issue bonds without having to meet the costs of producing a prospectus.
These are the reasons why I voted in favour of the report.
Mr President, many of my colleagues have shunned the idea of including environmental targets in the criteria for public procurement.
This is nevertheless fully in harmony with the view contained in the Treaty that environmental policy should be integrated with all EU policy.
Parliament has done some good work to increase the number of acts that support sustainable development in legislation regulating production.
This effect, which comes from the supply side also, however, needs support from the demand side, and it is precisely public procurement that can have an impact on that when it can be shown that there are grounds for including environmental criteria in an invitation to tender.
The so-called Helsinki case, on which the European Court of Justice has given a decision, highlights an important point.
When the party placing the order is a public body, it represents the general public.
In that case it should not just protect the public's financial interests but one also has to think, for example, about protecting the health of the general public.
The Helsinki case was about this very issue.
It goes without saying that public health is at the same time a long-term economic benefit, through which a public body will save at least just as much as it could have saved by choosing a cheaper supplier.

The aim of this proposal for a directive, which follows the Lisbon Strategy guidelines closely, is to establish provisions promoting coordination in order to ensure the freedom of movement of goods in the field of public supply contracts. It also aims to achieve freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services with regard to public works contracts and public service contracts.
The authors of the recommendation argue that there is a need to ensure non-discrimination, especially on grounds of nationality, and to facilitate competition by further standardising existing national procedures, choosing the most economically advantageous tender. To this end, they make it compulsory for national regulations, especially technical ones, to be non-discriminatory and not to run counter to the objective of opening up the markets in the field of public contracts.
It has been forgotten, however, that although the transparency of public contracts is crucial, they can still be an important economic policy instrument, even if they discriminate positively in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts.
Regional development can be taken into account, and social and environmental objectives (especially working conditions, protecting jobs, or even the means of production themselves) can be promoted, by inserting special provisions into the contract.
The most economically advantageous factors may not be the cheapest price, but rather the number of jobs created.
For these reasons, we voted against this proposal.
. (NL) Public tenders have for a long time been considered a panacea.
On the one hand, they are an alternative to nepotism, the awarding of public contracts to entrepreneurs who are friendly with politicians or high officials.
On the other, they are intended to bring to an end the production and provision of services by companies that are owned by the government itself, and so to enable private companies to access new markets.
I have already indicated - at first reading on 17 January 2002 - that I agree with the first intention but not with the second, which renders governments increasingly more dependent on companies.
The damage can only be limited by means of all kinds of bureaucratic rules which will, however, remain unknown to many and will therefore be broken on a regular basis.
In fact, the Dutch employers' organisation VNO-NCW has requested not to make the tender directives more far-reaching by adding 'a multitude of social and environmental criteria'.
In its opinion, putting out to tender is 'a purely economic process which should not be contaminated so as to achieve other goals'.
Even the rapporteur himself has already deleted a number of points on the subject of social protection and environment.
I reject this approach.
I do, however, share the rapporteur's view that the schoolbooks market does not function across borders and is not open to free competition, so that it is thus preferable not to lay down rules that assume that this is the case.
The award of contracts, services and supplies by public tender accounts for more than 14% of European GDP.
In spite of this, the sphere of public contracts and tenders has reaped few benefits from the creation of the internal market.
While it is true that these directives are very important for the equilibrium of the internal market and crossborder awards, the greatest benefit of these directives does not reside in this fact, but in the opportunity they provide for promoting sustainable development.
Environmental and social objectives must be built in to public tenders and contracts.
It is unfortunate that neither the proposal for a directive nor Mr ZappalÃ 's report grant public bodies the right (not to mention the obligation) to choose a given service or product by public tender on the basis of its sustainability.
I therefore support the amendments intended to grant public bodies this right.
It is hard to accept the fact that, on the one hand, through its European sustainable development strategy and the commitments undertaken at Johannesburg, the EU acknowledges that environmental costs must be factored into the economy, while, on the other, it prohibits the Member States from basing their acquisitions policies on that same principle.
. (NL) Mr President, the ZappalÃ  report has become a controversial dossier in this House as a result of a number of amendments pertaining to the allocation phase of public tenders.
It must be possible for social and environmental considerations to play their part in a public contracts dossier, provided this is at the level of the conformity requirements which describe the products or services and of the selection criteria which describe the potential suppliers taking part.
These, however, cannot be the only considerations at the allocation stage, which must be capable of being based on an objective comparison.
This is why I was unable to vote for many social and environmental amendments to the allocation criteria.
The same applies to concerns regarding discrimination.
This too must be counteracted.
Legislative measures can be taken with this in mind, but such measures do not belong in the list of allocation criteria for public contracts.

This directive follows the Lisbon Strategy guidelines closely. It aims to complement the general directive establishing rules on coordination in the sphere of public contracts, responding to the specific requirements of the regulations on the award of contracts in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors.
These reports are anchored to a large extent in the broader philosophy of liberalising and privatising markets and public services. Such policies were given fresh impetus at the last Spring Council, especially in these essential sectors.
The reports are also linked to the next round of World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations, not only because of the general agreement on the liberalisation of services, by which I mean the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but also because they address the issue of opening up the markets and public contracts, which was on the Doha Agenda and to which the EU attaches so much importance.
Where essential socio-economic sectors are concerned, of course, we cannot leave them at the mercy of market forces, obeying the principles of opening up the markets and of non-discrimination whilst at the same time curtailing the powers of Member States and national administrations.
For these reasons we voted against this proposal as well.
. (NL) The same objections apply even more to this directive than to Mr ZappalÃ 's report on public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, which was discussed at the same time.
This time, it is about large and long-term contracts and concerns tasks regarded, for a century or longer, as forming part of the core tasks of the government itself.
It is about products and services that are essential to society as a whole, households and industry, and which, at one time, were intentionally taken away from private companies, which had failed to offer continuity, a quality service, acceptable prices and a reasonable treatment of the consumer.
A government monopoly under democratic control was seen as the only acceptable solution that could guarantee the required product and consumer protection.
This choice was, at the time, scarcely contentious even among advocates of capitalism.
For deliveries and services in these areas, private companies preferred to depend on a reliable government monopoly than on the uncertainty and lack of continuity that characterises the free market.
Meanwhile, governments wishing to reduce taxes and suffering from a lack of funds have sold such companies to internationally operating concerns that wish to make a profit from them.
If this is what they choose to do, then it is true that rules are desperately needed.
However, it is then wrong to give much consideration to company secrets and other company interests.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we voted for the compromise reached between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, because today is a good day for consumer protection.
We have finally managed to achieve comprehensive labelling, so that consumers can no longer be hoodwinked, with products being required to bear accurate information about any genetically manipulated ingredients they may contain.
I think this will give industry pause for thought before it uses GMOs, because the majority of consumers do not want these products.
It does, however, mean that we will have to carry on working to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place for seed.
I was very disturbed yesterday by the Commission's failure to answer my question about how this is to be regulated in future.
We need this labelling.
It is a good proposal and it will mean that consumers will no longer be treated like children who have nothing to say for themselves, and will instead at last be given the chance to freely choose whether to opt for these products or not.
Then we will really see whether these products are accepted, because the markets will decide.
So it is not the EU approval process that is the great problem, as the industry would have us believe.
No, the problem for industry will be the market, because the market will decide, and the market is made up of individual consumers.
.
(FR) During this second reading of the draft regulation on genetically modified food and feed (Scheele report), I voted in favour of the following amendments, which are appreciably tougher than those adopted by the Council:
amendments, in particular Amendment No 19, reducing the threshold for labelling authorised GMOs from 0.9% to 0.5 %;
amendments putting an end to the tolerance of non-authorised GMOs in the food chain when their percentage is lower than 0.5%, in particular Amendment No 43; (incidentally, the question arises as to how the Council can, in this case, propose a threshold of 0.5%, when it maintains that such a threshold is technically impossible where the labelling of authorised GMOs is concerned);
amendments requiring the Member States to take measures to prevent the contamination of traditional crops by GMO crops (Compromise Amendments Nos 44 and 45);
amendments authorising the Member States to take emergency measures to restrict or prohibit the use of an authorised GMO when the latter subsequently proves to present a risk (for example, Amendment No 40).
Above and beyond these technical questions, I shall explain the position I have adopted on principle in my explanation of vote on the parallel report relating to the traceability of GMOs.
. (FR) In the series of second-reading amendments, we have voted in favour of everything that is in pursuit of transparency and of as comprehensive a labelling as possible.
On the other hand, we have voted against the compromise amendments that, in actual fact, would endorse the lifting of the moratorium.
. (FR) No compromise is entirely satisfactory.
The compromise on GMOs in favour of which the European Parliament has just voted means simply that it was impossible to take the negotiations any further.
The moratorium on GMOs will therefore be lifted, as desired by the Member States.
The 0.5% threshold beyond which the adherents of the precautionary principle wanted the presence of GMOs to be indicated would not have obtained a qualified majority either in Parliament or in the Council. To my regret, the vote has therefore gone in favour of a threshold of 0.9%.
Nonetheless, there are significant benefits to this compromise, because there has also been a vote in favour of greater traceability, which will enable consumers to be more vigilant, will make for tough regulations when it comes to detecting GMOs and will make precise labelling possible, as well as the ability to distinguish clearly between GMO and non-GMO production.
Transparency has won the day, even if the precautionary principle looks a little the worse for wear.
It is not a victory, but the amendments voted in favour of are important markers that will need to be further augmented in the future.
That is why I have voted in favour of the Scheele report.

Although this Council common position does not meet all of Parliament's demands, it improves the current legal framework for controlling genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We know, however, that it will constitute yet another step towards justifying lifting the moratorium, which should be maintained.
The compromise reached, though far from perfect, does ensure that all food and feed containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs will in future be regulated by a more coherent and uniform authorisation process, with authorisations lasting no longer than 10 years.
Furthermore, all genetically modified foodstuffs must be labelled as such, regardless of whether GMOs can be detected in them.
The possibility for Member States to take appropriate measures to prevent adventitious contamination of conventional or organic crops by GMOs is also accorded prominence, though it is difficult to conceive of effective control mechanisms once GMOs have been released into the environment, since borders have been removed and goods can move freely.
Nevertheless, I regret the fact that the thresholds for adventitious or technically unavoidable contamination by as yet unauthorised GMOs have been set at 0.5%, even if only for a transitional period.
There should be 'zero tolerance' in this area.
The problems associated with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) turn on apparently contradictory issues.
On the one hand, we have the issue of scientific and technological research, and especially its application to everyday life. Measures supporting and encouraging such research should never cease.
On the other hand, we come up against the risks facing anyone whose work involves scientific research on foodstuffs or the food standards which must be ensured for citizens. All these must be addressed with the greatest attention and utmost caution.
My position towards this report therefore rests on the lack of conclusive proof that such genetic mutations pose absolutely no threat to human and animal health.
GMOs elicit in me the reserve and caution which are second nature to those whose concern is the common good.
On the other hand, though, I would not want my position to be understood as standing in the way of scientific progress, which is always desirable and should not suffer from excessive legislative obstacles.
I would, however, emphasise the need to respect life in all its different forms, as well as the strict codes of conduct that govern the handling and use of substances as delicate and complex as these.
. (FR) With regard to GMOs, we do not want Europe to commit itself lightly, as the United States has done, to the ill-considered and uncontrolled large-scale spread of genetically modified organisms, guided solely by the interests of the firms that produce them.
Nor, however, do we want Europe to stand aside on principle from a technique that may be the source of certain hopes for feeding humanity.
Faced with a technique enabling human beings to manipulate the genome, that is to say to act upon the very core of life, it is vital that society should ask itself questions and that the necessary ethical debates should not be evaded.
It is the duty of the public authorities to legislate and regulate.
State sovereignty implies that states retain the power only to admit onto their territory desired and chosen products corresponding to real needs.
The Cartagena Protocol on biodiversity recognises this right.
Let us make full use of it in order to retain, in Europe, our expertise in the area of GMO culture.
Freedom of choice for the consumer and producer also implies that the necessary measures should be taken to safeguard the co-existence of production that draws upon GMOs and production that does not.
. (NL) Along with the Council and the Commission, the Social Progressive Alternative delegation has agreed to the rapporteur's compromise proposals.
Thanks to these compromises, it is possible to make rapid progress towards sound legislation on GMO food and feed, traceability and labelling.
At the same time, they put in place a number of guarantees concerning the co-existence of GMO and non-GMO agriculture, because an amendment to Directive 2001/18/EC will explicitly enable Member States to avoid the unintentional presence of GMOs.
At the same time, it is clarified that Parliament is the requesting party to draw up European legislation on co-existence.
After all, since traceability and labelling are not enough to be able to guarantee the freedom of choice on the part of the consumer in the long term, co-existence measures are equally important.
In exchange for these compromises, Parliament is abandoning its requirements concerning stricter threshold values for GMO contamination (0.5%), values which, in fact, would not be supported by everyone in either Parliament, or the Council.
Consequently, it seems more important to us to have certainty about an agreement on co-existence, because without such measures, not a single Member State would be able to enforce the threshold values.
With this legislation, even with the compromise, Europe is the first to introduce stricter legislation concerning the permission, traceability and labelling of GMOs.
Liability, however, should also be regulated at the earliest opportunity, and this is what Parliament requested of the Commission during first reading of the environmental liability directive.
. (FR) Like the Scheele report, the Trakatellis report on the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms is, for us, an opportunity to address a serious warning to the Commission and Member States.
Indeed, we have a strong sense that they are awaiting only the final adoption of the regulations on traceability before lifting the moratorium at present imposed on GMOs in Europe.
Such adoption would therefore serve as a guarantee, even if two other essential conditions had still not been fulfilled: the existence of a clear definition of liabilities (accompanied by corresponding financial guarantees) in connection with the damage likely to be caused by GMOs; and the entry into force of hitherto non-existent rules definitely guaranteeing the non-contamination of traditional crops by GMO crops.
This last point is essential. It may be remembered that union leader JosÃ© BovÃ© was convicted in France for having uprooted transgenic corn plants, an act considered to be a violation of a private property right.
Had not this violation, however, been preceded by another, much more serious, one: violation, in the shape of the risk of contamination by GMOs, of neighbouring private properties and of the natural environment in general, which is owned by all?
. (FR) In the name of the precautionary principle and because the development of GMOs makes me think of the sorcerer's apprentice in the service of easy money and an outmoded emphasis on high productivity, I am now hostile to the use and development of GMOs.
That being said, since GMOs exist - and whether we are for or against them - neither I nor anyone else can be opposed to improving traceability and labelling.
This improvement is a lesser evil that must not cause us to forget the basic question.
This regulation complements the Community system for authorising and controlling GMOs, which now comprises a compulsory labelling scheme for all genetically modified food and feed.
We know that approving it constitutes one more step towards lifting the current moratorium, which should be maintained given the risks of releasing GMOs into the environment and of the coexistence of GMOs with conventional and organic crops.
The US biotechnology industry is exerting great pressure to open up the European market to imports of GMOs.
It hopes, consequently, to force the acceptance of these technologies, especially in developing countries, as Mr Bush demonstrated in his recent speech to the convention of the Biotechnology Industry Organisation in Washington.
In his speech, he accused the EU of contributing to hunger in Africa by blocking imports of GMOs, and demanded that Community restrictions on GMOs be lifted.
Meanwhile, he refuses to ratify the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
The USA and the multinationals want not only farmers but also the agricultural and food policies of Member States to come under their sway.
This pressure exerted by the USA and the multinationals, moreover, is bringing closer the lifting of the moratorium and the abolition of the traceability and labelling system.
This system has become the first line of defence both in the battle against genetically modified food and the release of GMOs into the environment, and also in the attempt to rally consumers and farmers alike on this issue.
. (FR) Everyone without exception is in favour of labelling foodstuffs containing GMOs in order to inform the consumer and ensure the traceability of these products throughout the production and distribution chain.
These measures are mainly a matter of show, however, because it will be difficult for labels, controls and other inspections to prevent the propagation of pollen, the interpenetration of the two food circuits - the one with, and the other without, GMOs - and, finally, the victory of the biotechnologies of the multinational, Monsanto, and of the other giant American seed companies.
This Pharisaism on the part of European leaders, who pretend to control the GMO phenomenon - for health reasons as uncertain as the would-be positive contributions of these genetically manipulated products to world agriculture - is made all the more ironic by its timing.
Indeed, it was when the French farmers' leader, JosÃ© BovÃ© - of symbolic importance throughout the world in alerting people to the real or overestimated dangers of GMOs - was imprisoned at excessive, disproportionate expense that the European Parliament pronounced upon this subject.
Labelling for GMOs and imprisonment for those who oppose GMOs. Therein, in short, lies the ambiguity of these biotechnologies and of the European position.
Due to the absence of tough and integrated legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), legislation capable of safeguarding consumers and the industry alike, EU procedures for awarding marketing authorisations have been suspended for the last three years.
I applaud the legislation that we have today adopted on the traceability and labelling of GMOs, since it allows those GMOs on the market, as well as food and feed produced from GMOs, to be registered and their movements monitored.
This gives consumers the right to choose, and the procedure for withdrawing a product, should that be considered necessary, has been made easier.
The proposal for a directive does contain provisions, however, that could pave the way for falsification, for misleading the consumer and for distortion of competition.
The rules should be clear and simple.
For these reasons, I voted for the proposals for amendments geared towards the following: increasing detectability; ensuring coexistence between GMO crops and GMO-free crops; applying traceability and any subsequent labelling only to GMOs and products in which genetically modified DNA or proteins have been detected, rather than to all products.
. (FR) Traceability is the basic principle on which the protection of consumers and respect for their freedom of choice in the face of GMOs must be based.
Such traceability depends upon introducing systems for identifying GMOs, that is to say procedures guaranteeing the ability to know, at every link in the production and marketing chain, where they have come from and who has put them on the market.
Companies are also obliged to indicate if a product has been obtained on the basis of GMOs, as well as to retain this information relating to their identity and traceability and to make it available to the competent authorities.
With regard to the presence of authorised GMOs, we are in favour of the most demanding thresholds, given that the rate used must be realistic, that is to say based upon measurable, technical criteria.
This requirement will have to be kept constantly up to date as methods of detection and analysis become more refined.
Finally, it must be ensured that operators who choose not to use GMOs can derive a commercial advantage from their choice.
. With our vote today, we are trying to give people the right to make a genuine choice about GM products.
We have listened to the concerns of people calling for the right to make an informed choice about GM food and we are trying to put in place a labelling and information scheme which makes that choice a reality.
But we have to work within the boundaries of what is scientifically provable and in practical terms possible to implement.
We live in an imperfect world and the use of thresholds reflects that reality.
In all labelling regimes there is a cut-off point born of the practical and scientific reality that it's the best we can do with the science we've got.
Organic regulations allow for the presence of up to 5% non-organic ingredients.
Whilst we don't label very low levels of residues of pesticides or chemical contaminates in foodstuffs, we know they are present.
We welcome co-existence rules, which, by allowing GM crops to be grown alongside conventional crops, are another step towards making real consumer choice a reality.
I have voted in favour of the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for they clearly improve the Council common position and provide powerful guarantees in the fields of traceability and labelling, aimed as they are at preserving the consumer's freedom to choose between GMO and non-GMO products.
Contrary to my political group's decision and to that of the majority of the European Parliament, I have voted against compromise Amendments Nos 44 and 45, concluded with the Council.
These leave it to the discretion of the Member States whether or not to adopt measures regarding the co-existence of GMO and non-GMO crops.
Now, because of the rejection of Amendment No 40 to the Scheele report, Member States are forbidden to restrict or prohibit, valid though their reasons for doing so may be, the use of genetically modified foodstuffs presenting a risk to human or animal health or to the environment, as well as being forbidden to suspend or restrict their import.
Where is the guarantee of the consumer's freedom of choice?
It turns out that the only purpose of this legislation is to enable the European moratorium on GMOs to be lifted as quickly as possible.
A very large majority of the European Parliament, as well as the European Council, have just adopted some ineffectual legislation and will impose GMOs upon Europeans against their will.
. (NL) Mr President, the rapporteurs on the GMO dossiers have tried to draft reports that are in line with each other and that make an agreement with the Council possible.
I respect their work.
I also assume that progress in these dossiers is required so that the actual moratorium on admitting new GMO applications can be lifted.
I have voted along with my group for these two reasons.
Nevertheless, I am all but convinced about the quality of some sections of these pieces of legislation.
I fear that we will need to revise them in due course.
Obviously, I would also like to increase consumer confidence in GM food.
For this purpose, I think that, above all, a great deal of information is needed about the benefit of using the new techniques and about the safety of the foods in question.
I hope that consumer organisations and universities will join in, because according to the 'euro-barometer', they have the greatest power of persuasion vis-Ã -vis the consumer.
I too would like to give the consumer as much freedom of choice as possible, even when the keeping separate of varieties, traceability and labelling put up food prices.
However, the information that the consumer obtains should be crystal-clear and flawless.
Detectability should then also replace the paper criterion.
Unfortunately, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats lost that battle at first reading stage, and so I conclude that we are now treading a costly path - costs for the farmer, industry and therefore also for the consumer - without reaching the actual goal.
The question is whether it would not have been preferable if we had provided for confidence-building measures, namely objective information on a massive scale.
Luckily, we have a safety net: the evaluation that will take place a few years down the line will hopefully restore common sense.
After salmonella, listeria and other food infections, Northern European health fundamentalists are now directing their attention to the allergies that might be caused by the ingredients present in foodstuffs.
Hence, the need for a directive on the labelling of these allergenic additives.
Since, however, wine is treated as a food, bottles of wine too would need to be labelled in the name of the right to information concerning the risks of intolerance, particularly to the eggs and fish cited in Annex 3b, which lists the 20 ingredients that present risks.
It is true that egg- or fish-based glues are used to eliminate suspensions in wine during production.
It is clear, however, that these glues disappear along with the deposits they cause to form in the flocculation process.
There is therefore no reason for listing these processing aids on a label since there are no allergens left at the end of the process.
Together with the champions of wine growers and of common sense, we have tabled the amendments needed to extricate wine from this phobic and neurotic demand for labelling.
. (NL) Over the past fifteen years, meat inspectors in Belgium - people who are not technical engineers but qualified vets - have invested all their energy, all their might, all their resourcefulness in the fight against the illegal use of hormones in cattle farming.
This is done in difficult circumstances. They need to resist attempts to bribe them.
They are physically intimidated, and some are also affected in their private lives, because attacks have been made on their properties, and even on their lives and that of their relatives.
In fact, one vet-inspector, Karel Van Noppen, was killed on 20 February 1995.
It is fortunate that the killers and their clients were sentenced for this last year, and that they are now behind bars.
These are thus the difficult circumstances under which these courageous officials have the European total ban on the use of hormones enforced.
On occasion, the inspectors have also been thwarted in their unremitting labour by flippant statements made by certain scientists who have claimed out loud that the use of those sex hormones was totally harmless to public health.
Anyone who reads the Olsson report knows that this is hogwash.
In this light, I consider the approval of the Olsson report as a MARK OF HONOUR to all meat inspectors in Europe who carry out sound work and an INCENTIVE to remain permanently vigilant.
.
Britain has made phenomenal strides in recycling over the last ten years, but most of that has come from the business cycle, now we have to move to the domestic waste stream.
Householders will move towards separating glass, paper and plastic from general rubbish, and business will have to work with local councils to fund new equipment and set up new installations to deal with the flow of materials.
A realistic timetable for implementation is five years, any attempt to compress that time will result in spiralling costs.
A 2007 target date will cost an extra Â£143 million, bringing the costs of meeting the new targets from Â£397 up to Â£540 million over a five-year period.
That means bottle banks, trucks for doorstep collections and building new waste transfer, storage and handling stations, all of which takes time and money.
These EU packaging rules require a step change in recycling activity from British business, consumers and local councils.
Introduction of the necessary changes in an efficient and cost-effective way needs a little more time.
For these reasons we have abstained on those amendments seeking to advance the compliance date beyond 2008.
We believe it is vital to develop measures which help to reduce, recycle and reuse urban and industrial waste by means of rational, integrated solutions.
Packaging is a particularly important aspect of this process, as are incentives to use biodegradable materials.
Defining and implementing such measures, however, will have to take into account the particular circumstances and interests of each country.
It is, therefore, hard to understand why EU rules would be loosely transposed into national legislation when they do not take account of the variations existing between countries.
While I share some of the concerns expressed in this report, then, especially those on developing preventive measures, I am bound to wonder about the feasibility of the deadlines and targets proposed for the recycling of products.
I repeat that the effectiveness of any environmental policy depends on the will and commitment of national institutions: these are responsible for planning and mobilising resources, for holding industry directly responsible for reducing packaging waste.
The public in each country, however, also has a role to play in protecting and caring for the environment.
Ceaseless efforts are thus required to educate people, to raise their awareness and to engage them in the existing problems and in the means of overcoming them.
The first essential requirement for a waste recovery and recycling policy is prevention.
The prevention of packaging waste involves ensuring that producers base their decisions as to the type and quantity of material used on an analysis of the life cycle of the products, quantifying their environmental impact from the planning stages to disposal.
In this way, they can factor those environmental costs into the final price of the product.
I regret to say that the Commission's proposal for a directive did not go far enough in terms of waste prevention.
The second essential requirement is that legally binding targets be set.
From this point of view the directive is more ambitious, since it establishes targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste, especially for the following materials: glass, paper, plastic, metals and wood.
Targets, though, only guarantee a change in behaviour if they are realistic, by which I mean achievable.
For this reason, I support the targets set in the common position and dispute those suggested by the rapporteur.
In particular, I dispute the proposal that the recycling and recovery deadlines set for Portugal, Greece and Ireland be brought forward from 2012 to 2009.
It should be remembered that certain characteristics of those three Member States, in particular their scattered territories (which include outermost regions) and populations, make it more difficult for them to reach the targets for recycling and recovery of packaging waste.
I broadly shared the rapporteur's stance.
I am glad to say that this report responds to a broad consensus among all citizens, which was reflected particularly clearly in the almost unanimous vote at first reading.
It is essential to encourage the recovery of packaging waste, as well as recycling it when possible and preventing it from being produced.
The Union's strategic objectives as set out in Lisbon, and especially the environmental dimension, reinforced and transformed into sustainable development in Gothenburg, require the adoption of measures and policies capable of combating environmental waste and damage.
It is an established fact that protecting the environment is our only long-term guarantee of protecting our citizens and consumers.
Like several members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, however, I must express my anxiety about bringing forward the proposed deadlines by which the Member States must move to implement the proposal for a directive.
I would prefer a more realistic approach, as proposed in the common position, based on the treatment, recovery and recycling facilities actually in existence on the ground.
We will achieve our aims, which will benefit everyone, by means of a credible and sustained strategy.
Mr President, we too voted for the compromise on emissions trading, because it really is a new tool in the environmental protection armoury, one that will in future effectively cap 50% of CO2 emissions. This provides a unique opportunity and should be regarded as something positive.
We also welcome the fact that in Germany the Ministry of Economics and Labour has not succeeded in securing an exemption from the directive for entire sectors, but that we have instead ensured that virtually all sectors of industry are covered and that only certain types of plant with very stringent requirements are exempt - which in practice means that none at all are.
We hope that this instrument will result in all Member States actually presenting their national allocation plans in spring next year, making this a genuine economic instrument that I hope will help climate protection.
We will then see that climate protection makes sense for industry, and makes sense for everyone.
Nevertheless we also need new arrangements in future, and we need an action plan for CO2 emissions from road and air transport, which are increasing dramatically.
We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance have voted for this compromise.
We regard it as a good instrument.
It will mean that climate protection is taken seriously and that we can meet the obligations imposed on us by Kyoto.
Only then will we have credibility in the eyes of other countries.
I also hope that this decision will mean that countries that have not yet ratified Kyoto, such as Russia, will now do so, so that we can really start tackling climate protection.
Given the mortal danger posed to the world by the greenhouse effect, proposals that seek to improve measures taken to reduce the scale of the threat cannot be neglected.
I am nevertheless one of those who think that we cannot speculate on pollution and allow the rich to buy a right to pollute from those who cannot afford to develop.
That is why I voted against, and I call urgently for the speeding up of research programmes for the production of non-polluting energy.
Fusion is part of it, which is why construction of ITER should begin as a matter of urgency.
We feel that it is a priority and a matter of urgency to pursue the battle against the destruction of the ozone layer, the greenhouse effect and the ensuing global warming.
This battle can be fought either by using more alternative, renewable energy sources, which reduce fossil fuel consumption, or by adopting measures to reduce emissions from polluting industries and their effects. That requires investment in researching and implementing new technologies, which could help us to comply with the targets set in the Kyoto Protocol.
We reiterate our opposition to the creation of 'pollution allowance trading', however. Such a trade would turn allowances into a commodity and allow more developed countries to buy 'pollution quotas' from less developed countries, enshrining the status of the former as 'privileged polluters' and stunting the development of the latter.
Recent United Nations figures, moreover, suggest a tendency towards a rise in emissions from industrialised countries.
By accepting the gas emission allowance trading perceived by some as a tool for achieving the targets of the Kyoto Protocol, this report shares that point of view.
We feel that this is not the right approach.
. (FR) I voted in favour of this text.
I am not particularly in favour of this world system of selling 'pollution rights'.
Specific experiments that I have been able to conduct with manufacturers in my sector in fact show that these economic agents can make consistent efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
I nevertheless wanted to amend the Commission's initial proposal.
It seemed very important, in fact, that the scope of the directive should be extended to the chemicals and aluminium sectors.
By adopting my amendments, Parliament has endorsed my position.
I also very much regret that the Council of Ministers has not agreed with the stance taken by my fellow Members on this point, thus delaying the inclusion of the chemicals and aluminium sectors.
. (FR) So as not to delay the adoption of this controversial directive any further, I voted for the compromise with the Council, albeit with little enthusiasm.
My first concern is about the potential for cutting emissions.
This text makes no reference to the technical links that exist between the activities of different operators.
In the particular case of the iron and steel industry, inclusion of such a reference could have prevented the rights corresponding to blast furnace gases that are sent to electricity companies to be converted into energy that is used by iron and steel plants from being granted to the electricity companies under the national allocation plans when, without them, those companies could replace those energy sources with others such as natural gas.
Paradoxically, the iron and steel companies would have to burn off their blast furnace gases, thus increasing CO2 emissions, not to mention the emission rights they will have to buy back from the electricity companies.
This extra cost could well jeopardise the European iron and steel industry, which is facing increasing world competition.
A more explicit reference to the right for a company to trade internally the rights corresponding to its installations in different countries would have encouraged the creation and development of pan-European companies.

I welcome this proposal for a directive, which constitutes the first step towards the creation of an international market in greenhouse gas emission allowance trading. The Union has been able to blaze the trail in this area, ahead of the launch, in 2008, of the international scheme set out in the Kyoto Protocol.
The rapporteur's excellent work has made a significant contribution to this process.
The directive will create an EU greenhouse gas emissions market, introducing emission allowances for industrial installations. These allowances will have to be allocated by the authorities in each Member State.
