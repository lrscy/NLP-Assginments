What this means is that costs are running high and the benefit to us is relatively small, so I would like to say that I agree with my fellow-Members that this is perhaps not the right road to take.
Perhaps we would have something different to say if supplies really had been interrupted; we would probably be in a state of shock and attacking the Commission, asking why it had not responded to a crisis situation of this kind.
The only thing is that I see such a situation as highly unlikely.
It is far more probable that the greatest risk is the economic one set out by the Commission itself in its proposal, that of prices rising, probably creeping upwards.
That is what our main problem will be with gas over the next ten or twenty years.
The end result of Europe's increasing dependency on gas will be a slow rise in prices, which we will be completely unable to influence unless, in twenty years' time, we have managed to persuade the Russians to be nice to us and reduce them.
That will be the real problem.
Dealing with it will require, not a directive such as this one, but dialogue with Russia and also with OPEC.
That is what the Commission has already made a start on, and that makes a lot of sense.
I would like to close with an observation on the networks.
If we extend the networks, as we plan to do, the effect of this will be similar to that of maintaining reserves, as networks - the ones for gas, at any rate - are a sort of reserve, and extending them produces the same effect.
That, thank God is a point on which we can agree.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank the rapporteurs for drafting these reports.
The amendments to directives have improved some, if I may say so, rather poor proposals by the Commission.
The amendments adopted by the committee, however, do not as yet go far enough, as has been said here in a good number of speeches.
Responsibility for maintaining security of energy supply lies mainly with national energy policy.
To improve security of supply we also have to conclude agreements with other countries.
Member States must be able to decide freely on the organisation of security stocks.
Some Member States of the Union have abandoned the use of public stockholding bodies.
They have succeeded in organising matters efficiently and cost-effectively by other means.
That is why Member States should be able to determine and decide when it is permissible to site oil stocks in another Member State without jeopardising security of supply.
Siting security stocks abroad must, however, be carried out on the basis of contracts between the countries and in compliance with current practice.
The special circumstances obtaining in each Member State have to be taken into account to ensure supplies of energy.
To improve security of supply it is also important to ensure that there is a diversity of energy sources and an even distribution of energy providers.
I also wish to remind everyone that promoting the use of local renewable energy increases security of supply, reduces dependence on imports of energy and also creates employment.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate this evening proves once again that energy is not a commodity like any other.
The fate of the Alstom Group's 120 000 employees can no more be guaranteed by free competition than the future of energy and its independence - and thus Europe's political independence - can be by simply enforcing the rules and principles of the free market.
Even in the happy home of liberalisation - I am referring to the United States of America - they know this and they know how to act accordingly.
This is why, unlike the vast majority, if not all, of my colleagues, I personally welcome the endeavours of the Commission to retrain its sights in this area.
I am in favour of larger gas and oil reserves which, in the event of serious shortage, could prevent potential recourse to war in a world in which, as we know, the control of energy is often the primary cause of war.
As regards management, I am also in favour of greater solidarity between States during shortages, under the auspices of the European Commission, in order to avoid political tensions or even conflicts between Member States where those that are best provided for are able to impose their choices on others.
This is an area where, for me, legitimate respect for the powers of the Member States and the need for the European Commission to be given greater authority are not contradictory.
We therefore need to follow you, Madam President, if only - as Mr Linkohr has just said - to avoid you or the Commission one day being criticised for having done nothing.
Madam President, just how serious the issue of energy supplies is can be seen from the recent imperialist invasion in Iraq and the squabbling both before and after over how to divide up the spoils.
The particular issue of oil and natural gas reserves which we are examining here cannot resolve the overall problem, especially when it is addressed within the framework of the liberalisation of the market, rather than with the satisfaction of grass-roots needs as the criterion.
The main issue in the new directive is not whether compulsory reserves will be for three or four months, but the fact that controls of reserves and regulatory competence are being shifted from the Member States to the European Commission.
If this is accepted, it will undermine still further the facility for energy planning based on the needs of each Member State and will result in an energy sector structured in accordance with the choices of the strong powers of the European Union.
The Communist Party of Greece believes that every country should take measures to reduce energy dependency, make full use of domestic sources and develop and exploit new forms of energy, with the objective of securing cheap supplies for the working classes and protecting the environment.
It is, however, more than clear that the sine qua non to such energy planning is a radically different social and economic framework.
Madam President, much has been said tonight, and it is difficult to add anything refreshingly new.
However, I believe that this debate on energy security has never been so important.
We need only look at the recent power cuts on the east coast of America to see how an energy crisis impacts on ordinary people - no power, no lights in family homes, no refrigeration, millions of dollars lost by small businesses.
This incident was merely the result of a technical or human error that was rectified very quickly, but it has been a much needed wake-up call to those of us who too often take our energy supply for granted.
Recently the Institution of Civil Engineers said that the UK could face power cuts in 20 years' time because of its dependency on foreign energy sources.
It has also estimated that in the UK alone - even given centres of excellence around the North Sea such as the European energy capital of Aberdeen - 80% of the gas needed to fuel British power stations will come from distant and politically unstable countries.
Although Member States certainly have responsibilities for securing their own energy supplies, the need for cooperation early in a crisis situation will be vital.
However, judging by the debate this evening, opinion is certainly divided.
Safeguarding supply is paramount, but how do we reassure the public that we have security of supply?

Much has been achieved in the energy agenda in the EU, and liberalisation, at any rate in the UK, has allowed for consumers to have choice and hence cheaper gas and electricity, but, as Mr Linkohr has suggested, if gas prices increase in the near future, consumers will be very unhappy.
New threats from terrorism and sabotage - as we have seen in Iraq - and our increasing dependence on energy from outside the EU pose huge challenges.
As Mr Mitchell, from the UK's Royal Institute of International Affairs has stated, the key to energy security lies in diversity of supply.
Madam President, it has been an interesting debate.
At present, the Member States must contain a level of oil stocks equivalent to 90 days' consumption for each of the three main categories of petroleum products for energy use.
The proposal before us today is intended to replace existing European Union directives which govern this important energy policy matter.
Indeed, such a directive is needed because the current European Union legislation does not provide for a Community mechanism governing the use of oil stocks.
We live in an internal market and there must be solidarity between the Member States and the European Union in the event of energy supply problems.
In most countries of the Union - by way of contrast with the strategic petroleum reserve in America - security stocks are held by oil companies and are mixed with their operational stocks.
The main feature of the Commission proposal is to ensure that Member States set a minimum level of oil stocks for a period of 120 days.
The Members States of the Union must set up a public oil holding body and there must be harmonisation and coordination of crisis measures at European level.
The Commission will be assisted in its work by a committee made up of representatives of Member States.
On 1 May 2004 we will be living in a Community of up to 25 Member States.
Adequate provision of oil and gas is necessary if the European Union economy is to operate effectively.
There must also be a necessary reserve of key energy products in stock.
I believe that there is a role for the Commission in dealing with this sensitive issue and that this energy matter is best coordinated at European Union level in the interests of European industry and the citizens of the European Union.
.
(ES) Madam President, having listened very carefully to your speeches, I understand that, as we say in Spanish, el entusiasmo es totalmente descriptible [enthusiasm is entirely describable].
Ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Linkohr said a moment ago, it is very possible that if there had been any really serious problem with a break in supply we would not be having a discussion like the one we are having now.
Because all the problems which this proposal is intended to prevent would have been confronted and we would have had ways to respond to them.
The problem is that, as I see the issues developing, the proposal will probably be rejected tomorrow, at least one of them, and all I can say to the honourable Members is that I am not going to use the back door.
Some of you have expressed concern that I might go against this House's rejection, and make some complicated and tortuous deal with the Council.
No, if I do not have the support of this House, I will promote other types of initiative and I simply hope that the time never comes for me to say, 'I told you so', because that would mean amongst other things that we do not have any really serious crisis in the energy sector.
That is my intention, ladies and gentlemen.
Nevertheless, there are two or three things that I would like to clear up, because I have heard several questions which do not really correspond to the texts which I have proposed.
Firstly, the proposal on oil stocks is not intended to play with prices or intervene in them.
That is not what we are talking about.
We are talking about something very different, that the European Energy Agency has modified its recent decisions and has adjusted its previous criteria, according to which oil stocks could only be used when there was a break in the market, specifically of around 6 or 7%.
And in the face of this previous rigid position, there has been a development towards providing for the possibility of using stocks in view of the certainty of a break, without this actually having arisen.
Because when there is a break in supply and there is a 7% shortage in the market, we have a major problem.
And this development, which is one of the aims of the Commission's initiative, ladies and gentlemen, has been taken up recently by the International Energy Agency.
It is not therefore a question of playing with prices, and if there is any phrase which remotely gives that impression, that phrase of course should not be maintained, but it should be changed and we would make it extremely clear, because nobody intends to play with prices.
As for the second issue, it is not a question of giving the Commission more competencies, ladies and gentlemen, it is a question of having mechanisms which allow us to overcome the situation in the event of crisis.
One of you asked me: if you had to explain to your voters what the justification for this proposal is, how would you do so?
Well, I will explain it very simply: let us imagine that there is an oil crisis and the International Energy Agency says 'let us use the mechanisms'.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, there are two types of mechanism: mechanisms for managing the market and mechanisms for using stocks.
The States within the International Energy Agency can choose one system or another.
And this is all very well while there is no totally integrated market as in the case of the European Union.
Because the fact that a country of the European Union, one of the large ones, suddenly chooses an option which is radically different from that of its neighbour, which is perhaps not so big, is going, automatically to cause problems and tensions in the operation of the neighbouring country's market, even if that neighbouring country is of the same size.
The whole of the European Union market is going to be subjected to very great pressure.
Because in the field of energy, of oil, we are not talking about solely national decisions, I am afraid, but European Union decisions, because the market involves the whole of the European Union and, therefore, the proposal is not that the Commission should decide what should be done or not.
The proposal is that, by means of a system of comitology, with the participation of all the States of the Union, there should be consensus and agreement on how to use those margins, those mechanisms, so as not to cause greater tensions within the European Union's market.
That is what I am advocating.
And all of this should guarantee greater security if we think in terms of improving the number of days for citizens and for the European production system.
When it comes to the field of gas, what I am proposing is that there should be systems and plans essentially relating to management, because in the case of gas we are not just talking about reserves, but in particular of management, in order to guarantee that the consumers whose lives depend on gas do not have shortages and that they have a guaranteed minimum number of days of supply under all circumstances.
And that is what we are talking about.
Ladies and gentlemen, what we are talking about is improving security of supply and the functioning of the internal energy market and, therefore, of strengthening the European Union from the point of view not just of guarantees to consumers but also of its economic capacities.
I hope to see the results of the vote tomorrow and, ladies and gentlemen, as I have always said, of course I will take the result into account and under no circumstances do I intend to use the back door to achieve anything in the event that the honourable Members reject the proposals outright.
This is very clear and all I believe is that, tomorrow, you should consider your decisions very carefully before voting, because I believe there is room to improve the current situation.
Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her assurance on the point I raised.
I would like to add one comment following Mr Linkohr's remarks about prices: we should remember that the principal component in the price of oil is taxation.
We should not get too hung up on future trends in price.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0210/2003) by Mr Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council Regulation establishing the criteria for determining the States which qualify as safe third States for the purpose of taking the responsibility for examining an application for asylum lodged in a Member State by a third-country national and drawing up a list of European safe third States (14712/2002 C5-0010/2003 2003/0802(CNS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking my colleagues in the committee for their helpful cooperation.
The committee as good as unanimously rejects the Austrian initiative to set up a list of what are known as safe third states.
All of us want European asylum and refugee policy to be based upon humanitarianism and legal certainty.
Most of us want to see regulated immigration and an asylum policy that offers protection and sanctuary to those who are persecuted or tortured or whose lives or health are in danger.
Unscrupulous traffickers in human beings must not be protected by the EU's asylum policy.
Nor, however, can asylum policy mean our using gunboats to command vessels containing refugees to heave to or even, as one Italian minister said, using them to fire on such vessels.
Nor can it mean treating people who make their way to our part of the world as second-class citizens, moving them around and assembling them in camps outside the borders of the EU.
If, Commissioner Vitorino, the EU cannot successfully integrate immigrants and refugees and provide a framework for an asylum policy characterised by humanitarianism and legal certainty, we have a time bomb ticking away that is just waiting to explode into social and economic tensions within the EU and into external pressure from all those who are outside and want to come in.
Let us never forget that the Geneva Convention gives every person his or her own unique right to seek asylum in a foreign country in order to escape persecution and suffering.
This proposal defines a safe third state as one that has ratified the Geneva Convention, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The list of European safe third states includes the current 15 EU Member States and the 12 accession countries, as well as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland.
Of the 15 countries that are mentioned on the list, only Switzerland should, however, actually remain on it.
Why?
On 16 April 2003, the ten Member States signed the accession treaty in Athens whereby the Dublin II Regulation and the Schengen Regulation would, in future, apply to them.
Romania and Bulgaria would not be covered by the Dublin II Regulation until the Council had made a decision 'at a later date' (Article 6. 2 of the proposal).
With regard to Norway and Iceland, the Regulation will also only be applicable, via the Dublin II Regulation and Schengen Acquis, once they have given notice that they accept its content and are incorporating it into their national legal systems.
For these reasons, Mr President and Commissioner, only Switzerland would remain on the list, that is to say the list would be very limited.
Moreover, the Commission is called upon to monitor developments in the third states included on the list with regard to their compliance with the aforementioned principles, but the initiative fails to put forward any specific procedure for removing countries from the list or adding them to it.
The committee points out that, respecting the subsidiarity principle, any criteria for drawing up a list of safe third states must be seen as minimum standards, which allow the Member States to enforce higher standards.
Only four Member States - the UK, Germany, Finland and Denmark - currently have lists of safe third states, either by law or administrative practice.
The committee therefore questions whether a regulation is the most appropriate instrument, forcing many countries to implement changes without a political debate on the principles involved.
The committee also emphasises that the issue of safe third states is dealt with in the Directive on Asylum Procedures and should be dealt with there in the future too.
My remarks about whether a common list really is desirable - which is something I very much question - are of a personal nature.
The Italian Presidency, which should be present in this House, has promised that the framework Directive on Asylum Procedures will be ready during the autumn.
That was also stated in Thessaloniki.
We, in this Assembly, have conveyed that we wish to be consulted again once the directive has been redrafted.
What is the situation regarding this matter?
I had thought of putting the question to the Italian minister, but I cannot see anyone in the minister's place.
It would have been interesting to know whether we shall be consulted on this issue, but that is something Commissioner Vitorino may be able to answer.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we would - all in all and in the light of these arguments - ask Parliament to reject Austria's initiative tomorrow.
.
(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for the concise and clear report he has presented on this Austrian initiative.
I would also like to make it clear that this is not a Commission initiative. This is an initiative by a Member State.
It is an Austrian initiative, drawn up by the Austrian Government, and, in consequence, some of the questions put to me by the honourable Member cannot be answered by the Commission, because this is not a Commission proposal.
The Austrian initiative, however, poses a complex problem related to the use in the European asylum system of the concept of safe third countries.
The Council has consulted experts who have analysed this issue, and I can say that there is an agreement in principle within the Council in favour of discussing this matter more thoroughly during the next Council meeting on 2-3 October.
As the honourable Members know, five Member States made a joint declaration in June, calling for the Council to draw up a joint list of safe countries of origin.
What the Council is discussing at present is precisely the possibility of including a legal provision on how to define such a list, which could be incorporated into the proposal for a directive - this time a Commission directive - on asylum proceedings.
Linked to this question is another, on which no initiative has as yet been proposed, but which will also be submitted to ministers for discussion on 2-3 October.
This is the question of deciding whether a provision of this kind for safe third countries will be included in the directive.
That is still an open question at present.
In any case, both the subject of safe countries of origin and that of safe third countries will be discussed at the next Council meeting at the beginning of October.
From the Commission's point of view, moreover, the Council will have to consult Parliament once again on the asylum procedures directive as a whole, including in that consultation any possible provision on safe third countries or safe countries of origin which might eventually come to be included in that directive - which, as I said, has still not been ratified.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, applications for asylum are normally processed by the first country that we can describe as a 'safe country' with which an asylum-seeker makes contact.
If this principle is indeed always adhered to, and if there are enough of what we term safe third states, then what will be achieved is the distribution of asylum seekers over many countries and, as a result, speedy decisions enabling a person to know whether or not he is actually going to receive the support due to a refugee.
That is what we all want.
The present situation is unsatisfactory.
The Commissioner has himself presented EU statistics showing that a number of countries are at present having great problems with applications for asylum, whilst others have hardly any.
Austria, with almost five applicants for asylum per thousand inhabitants, heads this statistical table, followed by Sweden and Ireland, whilst Portugal, Italy and Spain are at the bottom of the scale with 0.1 applications per thousand inhabitants.
Comparison of these statistics reveals that Austria has fifty times as many applications to process as do the other states.
So I ask you to understand why this initiative has been taken, and that it is to be welcomed, in that its intention is to speed up decision-making in the asylum process.
The fact is that there is no stopping either time or the applications already in the pipeline.
The Austrian initiative is therefore understandable, and it is also necessary.
I take a favourable view of it, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, fully supports the substance of an initiative that will give us, in future, a list of safe third states.
It does for these two selfsame reasons, that we will both be speeding up procedures and, at the same time, sharing the burden.
As things now stand, though, it can no longer be fitted in to its ideal slot in the timetable, and so I would welcome it if the attempt could be made - by you, too, Commissioner, I would ask you - to sort out this problem with safe third states, if at all possible, when we deal, as we shortly will, with the procedural directive.
We will then not have to do it by means of a specific regulation, which would take up even more time, but would be able to achieve a quick and definite result by the end of this year.
I therefore support the proposal that a better way of handling the whole thing would be for it to be incorporated in the directive, but, apart from that, I am very much in favour - and the Group of the European People's Party also has an interest in this - of sorting out the problem of safe third states as soon as possible, something that will, in due course, benefit refugees.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs voted to reject the Austrian initiative on a regulation establishing criteria for determining the states which qualify as safe third states for the purpose of taking the responsibility for examining an application for asylum lodged by a third-country national.
That vote clearly reflects a broad consensus, at least a procedural one, to the effect that this instrument is not a useful one, and that seeing the initiative through to its conclusion would be a wasted effort.
This consensus exists in spite of this initiative's good intentions with regard to the fundamental issue.
Mr Schmidt has clearly understood that Parliament does not want to turn its attention away from really important matters, and that it is not prepared to take short-cuts which do not actually lead anywhere.
That is why I, and my political group, support the rapporteur's position.
In brief, if I may assess the initiative on its own merits and, to an extent, repeat what has already been said here, its overall scope seems extremely limited, both because 10 of the 15 countries classed as safe third countries on the proposed list have already agreed to implement Dublin II and the whole Schengen acquis, and because, as we all know, it is unclear when Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to be covered by any Community regulation.
That would make the regulation meaningless, since once Norway and Iceland have incorporated the Schengen acquis into their national legislation, only Switzerland would remain on the list presented by Austria.
Besides, and here also I am reiterating points which seem uncontroversial, it is hoped that the Directive on minimum standards on procedures for granting and withdrawing refugee status will be approved rapidly by the Council, as Parliament demanded in the Watson report and as was promised, furthermore, in Seville.
If that happens by the end of the year, as we hope, it would quickly render the Austrian initiative obsolete, since this Directive will resolve the fundamental issue of safe third countries.
When all is said and done, then, Mr President, that is why today's debate took place.
The fact is that even after Parliament had made a statement on the matter, we were not subsequently consulted about the revised Commission initiative, amended on 18 June 2002.
The message we want to send today, therefore, is that we wish to make our point of view known through this debate on asylum procedures.
In the final analysis, that is the crux of the matter, and Parliament cannot accept that a joint solution should be postponed and sacrificed in order to accommodate national prejudices or demands.
Rather, we must set aside superfluities and hindrances, devoting ourselves without further ado to the task in hand.
Precisely in order to avoid any further ado, therefore, I will thank Commissioner Vitorino, who has today shed some light on the matter and made our short debate entirely worthwhile.
Mr President, the large-scale misuse of asylum is a very serious problem in the European Union, and it would therefore be misplaced to discuss ad infinitum the gender of angels.
Indeed, a new directive should be laid down about standards for the recognition of the refugee status as soon as possible, and we should apply minimum criteria in this respect, whereby the Member States may, and can, apply stricter standards.
Europe should have specially adapted instruments at its disposal in order to get the asylum problem under control.
In Belgium, for example, more than 98% of the asylum applications turn out to be unfounded.
The handling of all those cases requires time, manpower and resources that cannot be used to deal with genuine cases.
The resultant backlog means that even more files are not dealt with, and, eventually, in that residence permits are granted without any prior investigation.
Such inefficiency and laxness only lead to a further influx of bogus asylum seekers.
Resources should therefore be found in order to separate the wheat from the chaff, and the list of safe third countries is one of those.
It is therefore surprising that the report should question the way in which the list of safe countries relates to the principle of the individual treatment as enshrined in the Geneva Treaty.
Well, it makes no sense whatsoever, on the one hand, to use a list of safe third countries and, on the other, to treat the files originating from those countries in exactly the same manner as the other files.
We must have the courage to conclude and recognise that the Geneva Convention needs to be overhauled.
This Convention dates back to 1951 and its principal object was to receive refugees from Communist dictatorships.
It is a product of the Cold War, and no longer meets today's needs.
Not only should we have a list of safe countries, the principle of territoriality should also be included in it.
The places best suited to receive asylum seekers are neighbouring countries in their own regions, so that Europe's asylum policy is no longer misused on a large scale to circumvent the ban on immigration.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by emphasising my support for the rapporteur's rejection of this initiative.
We understand the circumstances which led the Austrian Government to suggest it.
Those circumstances are highly specific to Austria's situation, and were clearly explained during the debate by Mr Pirker.
We have, on more than one occasion, however, drawn the attention of this House to the problems raised by this type of initiative on the part of Member States occupying the rotating Presidency, since they are often dictated more by internal political exigencies than by an overview either of Community interests or of the healthy development of the legislative framework of the area of freedom, security and justice.
I will also repeat something I have already said once before in this House.
It is important to underline the Commission's role in intelligently implementing the scoreboard established for that area of freedom, security and justice.
This initiative raises various complex problems, which have already been mentioned.
They include the problem of the regulation itself, which does not really seem to be the most suitable framework for this legislation, for reasons which everyone has outlined; and the issue of compatibility with the Geneva Convention, which was mentioned just now, by which I mean the need for us to take great care to ensure that the existence of lists does not conflict with the logic of individual examination underpinning the principles of the Geneva Convention.
What really seems important, however, is that we keep trying to define a common asylum procedure.
It is with that goal in mind, moreover, the goal of the Directive on that procedure, that we must examine, analyse and debate all of these issues.
It was important for Parliament to vote on that Directive, of which there is a new version on which we have not yet been consulted.
I would, therefore, like to emphasise the words of Commissioner Vitorino, who mentioned the need for Parliament to vote on that new version in the near future.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Schmidt states, in a concise and precise manner, most of the options that we seek to advocate in this House.
As a democrat among the Members who asked for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be included, as it stands, in the draft Constitution, I cannot agree with his conclusions.
In addition to the facts and figures expressed very well by my fellow Members, I will make three points.
The Geneva Convention was drawn up in the middle of the cold war, at a time when the world was one of extremes.
The European Union has become a new growth area which, in the majority of States of the world, embodies a hope, a goal to achieve to escape poverty, war and political instability.
The tragic escalation of social, religious and ethical tensions and civil wars, cause States to break-up and individuals to despair.
Their presence, their exodus towards our countries reminds Europe that poverty and crises are rife on its doorstep.
Europe has a specific role to play and the answer is not 'Fortress Europe'.
Yes, we do need a legal framework.
Yes, we do need to be very mindful of the decisions we make.
I do not believe, however, that a list of safe states is either useful or desirable.
Simply by having a list we are contravening Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or country of origin.
Not considering a claimant's request for asylum on the basis of a list of 'safe' countries really amounts to denying a refugee his or her most fundamental right, the right to be a fully accepted individual with inalienable rights.
I will conclude by saying that there is an urgent need for a European directive in the field of asylum procedure and above all for a concerted Community policy.
Without this fundamental legal basis our actions will not allow us to be coherent.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the second report (A5-0291/2003) by Mr Kirkhope, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to adopting a Council Directive on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air (14848/2002 - C5-0011/2003 - 2003/0801(CNS)).
.
Mr President, as a former United Kingdom Immigration Minister, I would be the first to recognise that one of the most difficult processes in the immigration system arises when one has to remove a person who has gone through all the legal processes and no longer has a legal right to remain - or has not provided a legal reason to remain - in a Member State and has to be returned to the place from whence they came.
This is a difficult decision for everybody involved in the matter.
It is difficult for the officials as well as for the ministers themselves.
It has to be done in a way that is both humane and effective.
Up to now there have been considerable problems in achieving this.
The travelling arrangements require that assistance be afforded by moving those particular persons by air and transiting them through other European countries on the way back to where they have to go.
A lack of coordination or cooperation has often meant much more suffering for the people concerned.
It has also meant that this operation has not always been carried out successfully.
Therefore this German initiative - one for which I am very pleased to be the rapporteur - is aimed at trying to bring the matter effectively and efficiently to a conclusion.
Our real objective here is for the persons concerned to be afforded the necessary support, if required, in terms of sustenance and medical assistance, when transiting through airports on their way to their destination.
We also need to make sure that the airlines carrying them are aware of what they are carrying and the progress of the procedures.
That has not always been the case in the past.
This report should assist in achieving that end.
Similarly it is important that the documents sent with the persons concerned are properly dealt with during the transit process.
This is by no means the case at the present time.
This is something we also wish to achieve through our work.
The difficulty has consistently been that it has always been someone else's responsibility to ensure the proper handling of these matters.
Officials have experienced frustration and difficulty over this, not only in Britain but indeed in most EU Member States.
I know that this measure would be greeted with considerable support and enthusiasm by those who will see that we are at last beginning to realise that we have to work together to achieve such ends.
This does not in any way affect the individual Member States' procedures.
Nor is it a measure that tries to be ambitious or reviews the whole issue of asylum procedures as such, or indeed asylum criteria.
That would be very ambitious.
It is not something that I aim to pursue in this report.
The report is a simple and practical measure that will be necessary from time to time once proper legal processes have been exhausted.
I have made my position clear.
I have tried my best in committee to make sure that all political groups and Members are taken along with me in the work that I have done.
I am proud to be the rapporteur of this report because, in my view, it clearly demonstrates that, regardless of differing political views on Europe, its future role and so on, there are many areas like this where we can work together in friendly and effective cooperation, in a way that makes a real practical difference to many people: both those who are dependent on our care and those who have to implement our rules and regulations.
For that reason alone, I am very pleased with this report and the reaction to it.
I hope that it will be fully supported in the House tomorrow.

(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the keynote of the Council's action plan on repatriation, adopted last November on the basis of a communication from the Commission, is the need for closer operational cooperation between the authorities responsible for implementing legislation in the Member States.
The German initiative on the table today, on transit for the purposes of removal by air, has been described as one of the implementing measures required to that end.
The Commission does in fact believe that a common framework should be laid down for questions pertaining to transit during the repatriation process, which is why the Commission supports the German proposal.
Airports in other Member States very often have to be used due to the lack of direct air links to the country of origin.
It is important to establish a clear legal framework for transit procedure in such cases, relating, for example, to the use of escorts and the individual competences of the transit airport.
This text, produced by the German Government, has already motivated the Italian Presidency to table initiatives advocating similar assistance in cases of land transit and joint removal operations.
Negotiations on these initiatives have already begun among working parties in the Council.
Despite the emphasis currently placed by the Council on operational cooperation, however, it should be observed that a genuine common policy for repatriation should also be based on medium-term legislative measures (such as compulsory mutual recognition of repatriation decisions, for example) which will not only facilitate cooperation between Member States but also establish a certain number of common minimum standards on deportation, detention and removal, ensuring humane treatment for repatriated persons, as the rapporteur mentioned a little while ago.
The Commission, therefore, intends to table a proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards for repatriation procedures and mutual recognition of repatriation decisions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Kirkhope on the quality of his report, which deals with a vital point linked to the establishment of a common immigration policy.
This is a subject we have debated many times over the years, arguing that any such policy should proactively promote legal immigration, running alongside an effective campaign against illegal immigration and the traffic in human beings.
We have also championed a European asylum system which respects our international obligations on the one hand while, on the other, safeguarding the stability and security of the Union's Member States.
This initiative relates to the mutual assistance which should be provided in situations giving rise to the need to remove third-country nationals who are the subject of removal orders ending their illegal residence, bearing in mind that air transport has become the most commonly-used means of removal.
This proposal for a directive aims, therefore, to lay down measures that may be taken by the competent authorities to assist with escorted or unescorted removals at European transit airports.
The requesting Member State must always ascertain, first of all, whether removal to the state of destination is possible using a direct flight.
If that is not possible, the requested Member State must provide assistance with the transit of third-country nationals to be removed.
Transit may be refused if the third-country national faces the threat of inhumane or humiliating treatment, torture or the death penalty, or if his life or liberty would be at risk by reason of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political conviction.
In other words, Mr President, we must remain true to our principles: we cannot countenance violations of the principles and fundamental rights on which we base European integration.
We cannot, however, move away from the substantive motives for granting asylum as laid down with binding effect in the Geneva Convention on refugees.
We must also remember that we cannot implement policies liable to encourage waves of illegal immigration, involving the trafficking and exploitation of individuals.
With this in mind, then, a great many of Mr Kirkhope's proposals are brimming with good sense and relevance.
Mr President, the Kirkhope report on which we are to vote concerns a German proposal which complements the discussions on drawing up a European policy for the return of illegal residents.
Effectively fighting illegal immigration certainly requires a returns policy but returns should, however, be undertaken in a way that respects all people.
We would like to mention the fact that the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights prohibit collective expulsions.
We are calling for an ongoing study of common definitions in the field of refusals of admission and expulsion measures.
As regards illegal immigration, we have seen an increase in the number of initiatives by Member States.
The many initiatives that are implemented are not harmonised at Community level and are not consistent with each other.
We cannot, therefore, respond in a satisfactory manner to the human tragedies that are unfolding on our soil.
Member States are adopting punitive measures to facilitate exclusion, but there is not yet a European will to define an immigration policy.
It is difficult to make progress in the area of illegal immigration management without having a general framework for legal immigration, which we should already have under the Tampere agenda.
For the credibility of the EU in this area we have to respond to the expectations of the public, who no longer understand what is happening with our immigration policies.
The Council must continue to press for the adoption of the proposals which remain on the table.
The three directives in progress on legal immigration must be adopted as quickly as possible.
The proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities was blocked in the Council.
That is unacceptable.
The proposal for a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, vocational training or voluntary service has not yet been presented to the Council working group.
Just as the proposal for a directive on the short-term residence permit issued to victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the competent authorities may not be able to be adopted at the Justice and Home Affairs Council at the end of November as planned.
We all know, however, that we urgently need this weapon to fight organised crime.
If the Council does not move forward on the issue of legal immigration, the degree of harmonisation risks being reduced to the lowest common denominator and any action against illegal immigration will be neither effective nor inclusive.
Mr President, this is the second time that we find ourselves discussing this topic.
The objective of Germany's initiative is to improve cooperation between Member States where the implementation of deportation orders is concerned.
Although direct flights are always preferable, this is not always possible in practice.
Sometimes transits through other countries prove necessary.
As the rapporteur has already pointed out, this initiative goes about regulating this tricky topic in the right way.
The deportation of people - as the minority opinion clearly demonstrates - remains a contentious topic, but, in for a penny, in for a pound.
An asylum and immigration system is of no value whatsoever if it is not enforced from start to finish.
This can lead to people being deported.
In my view, the proposal safeguards the rights of these people and at the same time, facilitates cooperation between the Member States.
Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to say something about the selected legal basis, Article 63.
The appended opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is right to see this legal basis as consistent.
This is a third-pillar procedure in which a Member State takes the initiative and Parliament has only an advisory role.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs often finds this difficult to deal with, and understandably so.
In my view, though, a political wish for more power should not stand in the way of, or slow down, effective legislation drafted on the basis of the correct legal basis.
We should let the political wish prevail, for then this will diminish our actual influence on the content.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will not be surprised to learn that my view of this differs from that of the Group of the Greens, and that I am at one with Mr Kirkhope in believing that this proposal for a directive is absolutely necessary as part of a policy on removals.
If the European Union is to establish and implement, in a credible way, a policy on legal immigration and an effective asylum policy, it must ensure that illegal immigration and the abuse of asylum meet with consequences and that those whose applications for asylum have been rejected, who have gone right through the legal system and have not been recognised as refugees, must leave the country.
This means, quite simply, that a common removals policy must form part of an EU immigration policy.
The proposal that Mr Kirkhope has submitted is a very balanced one, demonstrating due appreciation of the concerns that individuals have and taking them into account, whilst, however, guaranteeing that the rules imposed by immigration policy are actually complied with in the way that they must be.
A removal policy is an essential component of immigration policy and the proposal put forward today adds a piece to that jigsaw, enabling it to be properly implemented.
Mr Kirkhope and his excellent proposal therefore have my wholehearted support.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this House has already discussed the report by Mr Kirkhope on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air.
I am afraid to say that this issue has made the front pages in Belgium recently: let us remember the way in which Semira Adamu was treated and the fatal consequences, of which we are aware.
It is clear that these expulsion measures are, in practice, rarely carried out with the respect and dignity that each individual has the right to expect, in particular from this European body, which so often sets itself up as a paragon in the field of human rights.
On the other hand, when we send back or remove these people, we often ignore what is awaiting them on their return to their country and I think that we are showing a shameful indifference to the responsibilities that we have been given.
Underlying this text, at the heart of the expulsions there are people in transit, men and women who have a right to safety and respect.
As regards more specifically the conditions for expulsion and residence of third-country nationals, I would like to bring to your attention two very important points.
Firstly, the unacceptable, even inhumane, living conditions of some adults and children in closed reception centres serving as land transit zones.
I believe that it is equally urgent to solve the problem of asylum seekers living in airport transit zones.
These zones are not designed to accommodate them and no one can and should live in a zone where the law does not apply.
Would it not be possible to consider other methods that are more respectful of human dignity?
Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that we need to put the various directives that we have been dealing with for almost two years into practice, so as to ensure that our policies show our unconditional respect for the right to dignity, fundamental rights and our rejection of any act that could be an attack on physical or moral integrity of people and so that we can finally have a credible and honourable immigration policy at European level.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 10 p.m.)
Appointment of the ECB President
The next item is the debate on the recommendation (A5-0307/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the appointment of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank (10893/2003 - C5-0332/2003 - 2003/0819(CNS)) (Rapporteur: Mrs Randzio-Plath)
. (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, it is a pleasure to speak today on a matter of great importance for the European Union: the appointment of the President of the European Central Bank.
The creation of the euro is a considerable success in the history of European integration in both political and technical terms.
The euro is still a relatively new currency, and it will need to draw on the - widely recognised - experience of the European Central Bank to continue to be a success.
We are now replacing a President of the European Central Bank for the first time.
It is crucial for the European Central Bank and the euro that the selection of a successor to President Duisenberg is carried out transparently and that it is based only on the criteria laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community and in the Statute of the European system of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and on the agreement of the latter on the candidate most qualified for the job.
In appointing the successor, we must recognise and pay tribute to the excellent work carried out by President Duisenberg, and express our confidence that the European Central Bank will continue to perform all its functions as successfully as it has thus far.
The legal basis for the procedure for appointment of the new President of the European Central Bank is Article 112(2)(b) and Article 122(4), of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Articles 11.2 and 43.3 of the Protocol of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.
In accordance with these provisions, the Ecofin 'Information' Council adopted a recommendation on 15 July 2003 advocating the appointment of Mr Trichet as President of the European Central Bank for a term of eight years with effect from 1 November 2003.
The recommendation was forwarded to both you and the European Central Bank, in accordance with the Treaty, so that you could give your opinion before the recommendation was presented to the Heads of State or Government for the final decision.
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank adopted its opinion on 31 July and forwarded it to the Council and Parliament.
This opinion confirmed that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank is of the opinion that the proposed candidate is a person of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, as required by Article 112(2)(b) of the Treaty.
I hope that the European Parliament will agree with the Council and the European Central Bank that Mr Trichet is an excellent candidate for this important job.
The adoption of the opinion by Parliament will allow the Heads of State or Government to take a final decision on the new President of the European Central Bank's taking up office, within the time-scale set down in the Council recommendation.
Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I recommend that Parliament confirm the appointment of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet as the appropriate candidate for the office of President of the European Central Bank.
The nominee has submitted a written statement and has given oral explanations to the committee in the course of a confirmation process.
He has convinced the members of the committee not only of his personal integrity and professional competence, but also of his views on economic and monetary policy in the Eurozone.
At the same time, he has shown that he is receptive to the demand for more transparency and democratic accountability for the European Central Bank.
Five years after its foundation, the European Central Bank has come of age.
Its independence - in political, economic, financial, organisational and staffing terms - is guaranteed and is not challenged by the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
Its high measure of independence, which exceeds that of America's Federal Reserve, means that the ECB has a high measure of responsibility for macroeconomic and social development.
This requires the greatest possible transparency in the interests of democracy and integration policy.
For this reason, the transparency of decisions and the decision-making procedure is integral to the European Central Bank's role.
This effort to achieve transparency is reflected in the quarterly monetary dialogue with the European Parliament, in the regular publications and decisions, but also in reports, conferences and the inflation forecasts that are published every six months.
A kind of cultural revolution has thus taken place in Europe.
The culture of the national central banks in Europe did not have this kind of transparency.
Incidentally, transparency is also in the ECB's interests because it is still a new institution, and is thus especially reliant on establishing and consolidating its legitimacy, credibility and trustworthiness as a European authority.
Ultimately, a nation's monetary system reflects all that the nation stands for and all that it aspires to and endures, to quote Europe's leading economist Josef Schumpeter.
I believe that at the current stage of the debate, incorporating the Maastricht Treaty in its entirety into the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was the right step.
Over their centuries of existence, the role of the central banks has undergone radical change, starting with their private form of organisation in history to their changing status in the USA, the concept of combating inflation, and the role of an independent issuing bank.
It may be too early to find answers to new challenges today.
The task is to define the role of the Central Bank in a globalised world dominated by trade, commerce and international financial markets.
That means not only dynamic markets, but also more and higher risks to international financial stability.
What role, then, can and should central banks play in order to contribute to financial stability, to avoid financial crises and to provide assistance?
Is the ECB equipped for a role as a lender of last resort?
Is this what we want?
The euro has enhanced Europe's international status as well.
The ECB will have to play an ever greater role in defining and implementing appropriate policies for the global economy.
We are concerned about the dramatic imbalance in the US economy and the risks that may arise for every other part of the world in the mid to long term as a result.
Many issues relating to the ECB's future policy are tied in with the appointment of its new President.
They include the definition of price stability as much as the issue of monetary policy instruments.
Maintaining price stability as the primary goal must not result in the ECB removing support for growth and employment from its list of tasks.
Monetary policy is not neutral, so the ECB must play a role, as a macroeconomic actor, in coordinating European policies.
This is where willingness to engage in ex-post coordination is not enough.
Decisions will have to be taken on this issue, and fresh impetus must come from the new President.
The European Parliament expects other measures towards greater transparency as well, from the publication of summary reports of decisions, with arguments for and against the decisions adopted, to the (anonymous) results of voting in the ECB Governing Council.
What is important is an open and transparent monetary policy in which access to the decision-making process is a given, because this is in all our interests and in the interest of the common good.
The future President is able to build on the successful work undertaken by the first ECB President, Wim Duisenberg.
The Members of the European Parliament are confident that he will face up to the new challenges and be able to find the right solutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group has three economy and monetary policy criteria by which we also judge the proposal for the new President of the European Central Bank.
Only last week, at our study days in Madrid, we redefined and laid down once again the crucial points of our policy.
The first is a clear and unequivocal endorsement of the Stability and Growth Pact.
We regard the Stability and Growth Pact as the regulatory framework for the Member States' budgetary policies.
We regard it as a prerequisite for price stability and therefore for sustainable growth and job creation.
The Stability and Growth Pact is a driving force for reform, and it is the basis on which to achieve more transparency in the Member States' budgetary situations.
It is also an orientation aid for the new accession countries as they move towards the common currency, in order to be able to fully accept the euro.
Our second cornerstone is the independence of the ECB.
This independence must be expressed through the continuation of the policies that were guided by Wim Duisenberg's steady hand.
It must be expressed through continuity, trust, credibility, professionalism, team spirit, and vigilance towards change, as well as clarity in its decision and a considerable talent for communication.
Thirdly, our group says a resounding 'yes' to the single currency.
The single currency is the basis of a functioning internal market and the expansion of the internal market into a home market.
These are also the criteria by which we judge the candidate.
In both his written statements and oral answers, he voiced unequivocal support for the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact, price stability, independence and the single currency, and rejected any attempts to sabotage them as undermining currency stability, price stability, and a policy for growth and jobs.


When asked about the most important guiding principles, Mr Trichet said, and I quote: 'The highest level of credibility in the pursuit of the objective of price stability, independence, enshrined in the Treaty, vis-Ã -vis any power or type of influence whatsoever; lastly, realism and pragmatism in the assessment of a financial and economic environment changing rapidly, due to new technologies and changes in the behaviour of economic agents'.
Secondly, he said: 'Indeed, price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation.'
He made it clear that price stability is not enough on its own, and that it must be supplemented by a judicious budgetary policy, by an appropriate balance of productivity gains and moderate nominal compensation growth, and by urgently needed structural reforms.
He pointed out that the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall concept and the common rules for the different economic policies of the Member States.
In all his answers, he has thus clearly recognised and affirmed our principles as the correct ones.
For this reason, my group, too, will endorse his appointment.
(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vast majority of the Group of the Party of European Socialists will give its vote to Mr Trichet.
Mr Trichet was one of the architects of the Maastricht Treaty and is clearly qualified to head the European Central Bank, but because he is to some extent one of the inventors of the Maastricht criteria which led to 12 of the Union's Member States adopting the euro, he knows better than anyone that there is nothing scientific about these criteria, which were transferred largely unchanged into the Stability Pact: they are the product of a political compromise that reflects the economic reality and balance of political power of that time.
The Stability Pact is not the outcome of an exact science: like any agreement entered into freely, its terms must be complied with.
Nevertheless, this pact is not as sacred as Mr Karas would have us believe.
It can and must be improved, as Commissioner Monti stated in an interview: it is high time that we made what is an intelligent Stability Pact an even more intelligent Stability and Growth Pact.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists is in favour of a stability policy.
The fight against inflation is crucial for protecting Europe's poorest citizens in particular.
As, however, the Italian President, Carlo Ciampi underlined, there can be no stability without growth and no growth without stability.
This dual policy is, therefore, necessary.
The European Central Bank must fight against inflation, but also against recession.
The Bank has objective criteria for combating inflation, but none for combating recession.
Furthermore, the European Central Bank must support the Union's other economic policies: in this regard, combating inflation is extremely important but not enough.
Europe must pull itself together.
We cannot confine ourselves to constantly calling for stability.
We must also invest in growth and allocate more money to research and development, to infrastructures in Europe, and to lifelong learning and training.
We hope that the European Central Bank, with its new President, will give such a policy the appropriate support.
Mr President, together with the majority of my group and, in any event, all the French members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities (EDD), I will be voting against the appointment of Jean-Claude Trichet as President of the European Central Bank although I have been told that it is unusual to vote against one's fellow countryman.
Nevertheless, as we all saw, Mr Trichet renounced his nationality in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, saying 'I'm not a Frenchman' - in order to gain the good graces of the Commission, in which he appears to have succeeded.
The reason for our opposition, however, goes deeper.
Jean-Claude Trichet is, as every French person knows, one of the instigators of a policy that sacrifices, which has sacrificed and which continues to deliberately sacrifice growth to the Malthusian dogma of stability.
For ten years we have been paying for the Central Bank's monetary policy at a rate of one growth point per year and I must say that I am astonished, Mr Lipietz, that you have become such an ardent royalist.
During the work of the European Convention, we and by 'we' I mean Mr Katiforis and many others, most of the socialists and the Greens, tried to change this dogma and to propose that, in the new European Constitution, as much ambition should be devoted to growth as to stability.
We failed and I believe that this Parliament, at least those Members who took part in this struggle, would restore some pride by abstaining on Mr Trichet's appointment, because he is so emblematic of this policy which has caused and which continues to cause so much damage, as we see on a daily basis, to the European economy.
Mr President, I shall be abstaining from voting on Mr Trichet's appointment partly because, as the UK is not a member of the eurozone, I tend to act cautiously in speaking on these internal matters of organisation in relation to the euro, and partly because I have mixed feelings about Mr Trichet's appointment.
He is clearly an exceptionally talented, able and intelligent central banker.
However, at the end of our discussions in committee, I felt that despite these qualities he really did not have anything new to say about the euro.
He did not have any answers to some of the real economic problems that we are seeing in the eurozone.
There are increasing levels of unemployment in Germany and France and their economies are in trouble to the extent that neither are able to meet the rules of the Stability Pact.
It is clear that there are real economic problems in the eurozone and I have heard nothing from Mr Trichet that would indicate his ability to solve them.
It came as no surprise to me that the Swedes have decided that they do not want to abolish their national currency.
The continuing economic difficulties in the eurozone are one of the many reasons why the UK should not abolish its national currency either.
For those reasons I shall be abstaining from voting on Mr Trichet's appointment.
Mr President, I shall be no more of a royalist than Mr Goebbels or Mr Lipietz, and I will therefore be supporting Mr Trichet's appointment on the basis of his professional skills.
I believe that his qualities are unanimously recognised by the central bank governors within the euro zone.
He has all the qualities to make a rigorous president of the ECB.
He does not receive full marks for the monetary policy he will be implementing but I have yet to meet a central bank governor who is open to any other monetary policy.
I would say, therefore, that if we are looking for the Eurozone's economic and monetary policy to be overturned, we should look elsewhere.
I wish to add three observations to this statement.
Firstly, I hope, and for the moment I have no way of telling whether this will happen, that Mr Trichet will be more open to what we must call economic policy coordination.
Because he has been involved since the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, he knows very well that this is founded on two pillars: monetary union and economic union.
This economic union cannot operate without governments that are able to understand that their budgetary and fiscal policy falls within the realm of the common interest.
The role of a central bank governor today, unless he or she wishes to be a permanent scapegoat, is to remind governments of this responsibility.
Telling governments that they can avoid having to coordinate economic policies by simply having a monetary policy and instructing them only to undertake structural reform will not enable the Eurozone to tap into a real potential for growth centred on investment in research, development and education.
My second observation is that, if we want to restore confidence, we will need this economic policy coordination and not just a central bank that applies the criteria strictly.
Lastly, I shall take the opportunity provided by this morning's debate to express my astonishment and my concern to see the position adopted by the European Central Bank yesterday, calling for non-inflationist growth and price stability to be included in the objectives of the draft Constitution.
I believe that the balance of the wording of Article 3 as produced by the Convention is quite satisfactory and that it would be dangerous to follow the lead of the Central Bank on this matter.
Mr President, a hearing with the president or a governor of the Central Bank always leaves much to be desired, as this person has to be extremely careful in public on account of his position.
For the rest, I enjoyed his expertise.
Based on the response to the questionnaire drawn up by ECON, I have come to the conclusion that Mr Trichet is like a clone of Mr Duisenberg.
I think it will be excellent if this comparison continues to be true in the long-term.
The difference between the two was the use of language.
You see, psychology is important in monetary policy.
Mr Duisenberg never spoke Dutch because English is the main language of the ECB, and as far as I was concerned, Mr Trichet spoke French too much during the hearing.
I hope that this does not mean that he will still be a little bit French from a functional point of view, because one would want him to defend the case of the euro in clear language in Paris.
The euro will only exist if the people have faith in their currency.
For this to happen, we need to have strict enforcement of the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact.
I am extremely pleased that Mr Trichet is also of this opinion and is continuing Mr Duisenberg's policy.
It is of the greatest importance that we adhere to the rules of the Stability Pact without political games and without interpreting the rules to promote our own interests.
Those who argue for a flexible approach to the rules in order to stimulate growth - I am thinking here of Prime Minister Raffarin, for example, deny or do not understand, or even more seriously, do not want to understand, that the percentages mentioned in the pact already have a structural component which operates within all movements of the economy.
I expect Mr Trichet to continue to follow this line in the future and to be consistent when it comes to the execution of the rules and to speak out clearly on this matter in Paris too.
I expect the European Commission to do the same and if necessary to impose sanctions on Member States that do not abide by the rules.
A tight policy promotes the credibility of monetary union and faith in our euro.
According to the classical economy, die Massengewohnheit der Annahme [the mass custom of acceptance] is the basis for the functioning of money.
Our willingness to use the euro in the European Union must be confirmed and increased every day.
Mr President, taking Mr Duisenberg's place will be no easy task, since the current President successfully guided the Central Bank through the formative years of the single currency and, above all, since the need for a more generous monetary policy is becoming crucial for economic growth.
In his answers before the Parliamentary committee, Mr Trichet emphasised, among other things, the fundamental role of realism and pragmatism in assessing the economic and financial climate at a time of such rapid change.
That realism and that pragmatism are, indeed, exactly what is expected of the new president.
The citizens of Europe are calling for more economic growth and more employment.
Most of the politicians who represent them are calling for more budgetary flexibility and monetary understanding, given the economic crisis which Europe is experiencing.
We fail to heed or respond to these worries at the cost not merely of leaving matters unresolved, but also of giving impetus to the collapse of the single currency's credibility, in the wake of which citizens' loyalty to Economic and Monetary Union will be weakened.
The results of the Swedish referendum and the recent surveys of the level of commitment to Europe in Norway are a sobering warning.
We can no longer gloss over the fact that citizens are starting to think that the cost of the euro is too high for Europe.
The Stability and Growth Pact, of which the Commission is the guardian and the European Central Bank a fierce advocate, reflects a noble and fundamental ideal, but the way in which it is drafted is not satisfactory because it fails to address crisis situations such as we are in currently.
Defining broad guidelines for public spending is more important than the level of deficit.
The pact does not take this principle into account.
Encouraging the deficit in order to lower taxes - a policy which when implemented in isolation brings only a few economic benefits, and always creates inequalities - is one thing; accepting the deficit as the result of investment policies that really do help the economy recover is quite another.
The Keynesian benefits of increasing public spending dry up over a certain level, it is true; it is also true, however, that the launch of subsequent initiatives to promote economic growth, which is absolutely crucial to recovery, will never be possible without increasing public spending.
Besides, it is very strange that there is so much talk today of economic growth initiatives, when the reforms and goals defined for that very purpose in the Lisbon Strategy are still so far from being attained.
The ECB, then, is required to show the realism and pragmatism recognised as essential by its President-Elect if the economic system based on the single currency and the common monetary policy, which was constructed so laboriously and with such difficulty, is not to be threatened with collapse.
That responsibility, moreover, is in the hands of Mr Trichet.
Good luck!
Mr President, on behalf of the CSU, I too would like to voice support for Mr Trichet.
This is due firstly to his professional competence and secondly to his personal qualities, for he will continue the tradition established by Mr Duisenberg.
Although my highly esteemed colleague Mrs Villiers criticised Mr Trichet on the grounds that he did not have anything new to say, that is precisely what we are looking for.
We want him to stand for continuity as the head of the ECB.
This applies especially to the ECB's core tasks - low inflation, a commitment to the ECB's independence, and the struggle to uphold the Stability Pact.
In this context, I especially hope that, as a Frenchman, he will deal critically with his home country.
I also hope that the two Commissioners who are our guests here in plenary today, Mr Solbes and Mr Bolkestein, will fight to uphold the Stability Pact.
Sweden showed us how the wrong budgetary policy in the Member States can influence the vote.
What I really do not like about this debate is the constant criticism of the ECB.
The ECB is being held responsible for meeting the Lisbon objectives.
The main responsibility for meeting the Lisbon objectives lies not with the ECB or indeed with the Commission.
They can both contribute to the process, but the chief responsibility lies with the Member States, and a great deal of time has been lost here because Member States have not done their homework.
I would ask all of you who regularly hold the ECB responsible and voice criticism of it to be equally or even more critical of the Member States' failures.
I think that would take us much further forward.
. (IT) Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for their attentive and authoritative speeches on this issue.
We are proud, honoured, privileged and aware of our good fortune to be part of the transition to an enlarged European Union, and, today, we are witnessing a moment which is certainly important for the strength and the stability of Europe.
In reiterating the Council's support for the candidacy of Mr Trichet, I would like to reassure Parliament that I will pass on all the opinions you have expressed today, both positive and negative, to my colleagues in the Council.
Allow me to conclude with a word of encouragement: I would like to quote Seneca, who said in 'On Providence' that, fortunately, often 'the most dangerous enterprises are assigned to the bravest soldiers'.
I am convinced that this will be true in this case too.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0238/2003) by Mrs McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (COM(2002) 92 C5-0082/2002 2002/0047(COD))
. Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs McCarthy, the rapporteur on this complex and technical but important matter, for her excellent work on this report.
I should also like to thank the rapporteurs of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, who have also made a major contribution to Parliament's work on this issue.
Computers are becoming ever more ubiquitous in our everyday lives and, quite apart from the box that sits in almost all our offices and quite a few of our bedrooms, microchips are now commonplace in everyday gadgets, such as electric razors, cars and microwave ovens.
The question of how to define the patentability of computer-implemented inventions is thus becoming steadily more important, especially as such inventions are estimated to cover 15% of new patent applications.
Indeed, the potential patentability of computer-implemented inventions is already accepted in current European Patent Office practice.
The proposed directive does not aim to abolish this practice or extend it to cover the patenting of pure computer programs, as many opponents of the directive have claimed.
The directive is not intended to cover the patenting of pure computer programs.
Indeed, many have - falsely - claimed that the directive introduces for the first time the notion of patentability of software inventions in the European Union's patent practice.
That is not the case.
I am, therefore, all the more pleased that the rapporteur has been able to steer past these misconceptions and produce a highly constructive report which seeks to build on the objective of the Commission set out in its original proposal, namely to clarify the scope of patentability of inventions, which incorporates software, and to harmonise across the European Union, on the basis of existing practice, the proposal which seeks to achieve harmonisation and clarification.
However, nothing will become patentable which is not already patentable.
It is in this spirit that the Commission would welcome the amendments to the text proposed in the report by Mrs McCarthy as a further step to clarifying that objective.
Opponents of the directive have mounted a very vocal and, at times, even personal campaign based on half-truths and misconceptions which play on legitimate concerns over competitiveness, especially for smaller firms.
But the fact is that the proposal does not introduce software patents and will not have all the terrible effects that the prophets of doom would have you believe.
It is a prudent, cautious measure which will clarify and, if anything, tighten the rules which already exist.
I am aware that a large number of amendments to the McCarthy report have been tabled, many of which seek to reintroduce ideas and themes already considered and rejected by the committee during the preparation of the report.
There are some interesting points but, in the main, I am afraid that the majority of those amendments will be unacceptable to the Commission.
I am very concerned about this situation: many of these amendments are fundamental.
There is a very real prospect that the proposal will fail if Parliament chooses to accept them.
If that were to happen, I fear two possible consequences, neither of which, I suspect, has been foreseen by some Members of Parliament and neither of which would advance the objectives which seem to lie behind a number of the new amendments.
Firstly, in the complete absence of harmonisation at Community level, the European Patent Office and the various national patent offices would be free to continue their current practice of issuing patents for software-implemented inventions which may blur or even cross the line in undermining the exclusion from patentability of software as such under Article 52 of the European Patent Convention.
The result would be not only continued legal uncertainty and divergence for inventors, but also a roll-back of the position adopted by almost everyone in this Chamber and, above all, the Commission itself, namely to maintain the exclusion of pure software from patentability.
We do not want that. The proposal rejects that.
Secondly, in the absence of harmonisation at Community level, Member States are very likely to pursue harmonisation at European level instead.
Let me explain what I mean by that remark.
Unlike many other fields, that of patents is unusual in that, as a result of the existence of the European Patent Convention and the creation of the European Patent Office, there is already a supranational patent system in place which covers the whole of the European Union and indeed beyond.
This system can be operated independently of the Community's legislative process.
If we fail in our efforts to achieve harmonisation of patent law relating to computer-implemented inventions in the European Union, we may well be confronted with a renegotiation of the European Patent Convention.
The process of renegotiating the European Patent Convention would not require any contribution from this Parliament.
The situation is clear: there is a single objective but a choice of means.
Either we proceed using the Community method or we take a back seat and watch while Member States proceed by means of an intergovernmental treaty.
It is clear that proceeding via this Parliament would give European citizens a greater say in patent legislation, an area which is so crucial to our economy.
Mr President, the Commission proposal on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions before Parliament is not, as some opponents of the directive have suggested, a new phenomenon.
Neither does it argue for the patenting of software, nor for extending the patentability and scope of protection in this area.
The fact is that some 30 000 patents for computer-implemented inventions have been handed out by the European Patent Office and indeed national patent offices.
Computer-implemented inventions are present, as the Commissioner has said, in everyday household appliances, from safety devices such as airbags in cars to mobile phones, washing machines and an endless list of other devices with relevance going well beyond the traditional computer industries to the heart of our manufacturing sectors.
Let us be clear: without this directive, patents will continue to be filed.
Out of over 110 000 applications received at the EPO in 2001, 16 000 dealt with inventions in computer-implemented technologies.
In the USA, and increasingly in Japan, patents have unfortunately been granted for what is essentially pure software.
An EU directive, by setting limits to patentability in this area, could stop the drift in Europe towards a US-liberal style of patenting software as such, and indeed of patenting pure business methods.
One oft-quoted example of such a bad patent is Amazon's 'one-click' shopping method.
Clearly this technology is not new, nor is it unique, and patenting of software business methods such as this is not good for innovation and competition.
It is unfortunate that the EPO has granted it a patent: this is an example of bad EPO practice.
Without a doubt computer-implemented inventions - genuine inventions which, in some cases, are the result of 10 to 15 years' R&D investment - are important for the European economy.
At a time when many of our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East, we need to rely on our innovation and inventiveness to earn our living.
I have seen letters from small companies across Europe which are supportive of this directive.
A small Belgian company employing 12 people has written to me saying that it needs patents to get a return on its investment, to grow its business and to ensure that others respect its technology.
It is important for many European companies to grow their businesses through revenue secured by patents and licences.
This is also the case for a ten-person company in the south-west of England, located in an economic blackspot with high unemployment.
This company granted a licence to a US multinational for its computer-implemented voice recognition patents, which shows that in the world of global patents there can be examples of David meeting Goliath.
Without patent protection the small company could have found itself in a perverse situation where its R&D efforts would have been free for the multinational company which, with its team of patent lawyers, would have gained the patent in this area.
Consequently, the European company would not have reaped the benefits and, indeed, there could have been an infringement of a patent owned by a multinational.
I have tabled amendments in my report to underline my opposition to the patenting of software as such.
We want explicitly to exclude computer methods, algorithms and mathematical models from patentability, as set out in a new Article 4.
I have attempted to produce balanced legislation that takes account of the needs of all sectors of the industry, not just one vocal sector that is against this directive.
I would be the first to agree that we need more debate on and refinement of the proposed legislation.
I therefore ask the Commission to look at the crux of this debate: how do we get good patent law which rewards our most innovative companies for their investment in R&D while, at the same time, not allowing companies to use patents to abuse a dominant position, lock up technology and stifle innovation and competition?
I therefore ask the Commissioner to look at these amendments tabled in plenary today.
They are very clear in suggesting that we need to limit patentability to genuine inventions in Articles 2 and 4.
We want to ensure interoperability to enable computer programmers to engage in reverse engineering practices and to decompile programs for experimental purposes without risking infringement or legal action.
It is vital that we address the perception that patents are only for big business: small companies can, and do, gain from patent protection.
However, to have a fighting chance in such a competitive business they need access to affordable patents and assistance with legal fees to protect and enforce their patents.
Other amendments seek to ensure that the granting of a patent does not allow monopoly or abuse of a dominant position.
We also want to protect the open-source community which makes a vital contribution to competitiveness in the area of software development.
Therefore, I ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the amendments and to recognise them in the spirit in which they have been tabled, as a genuine attempt to ensure that Europe develops good patent law in the field of computer-implemented inventions.
This does not mean rubber-stamping bad practice in Europe, but developing good practice for the future, good law, good patent examiners, and a quick death for applications that are clearly not inventions.
We also want to ensure that multinationals do not dominate in our EU markets.
We need patents in order to protect our own companies and investments so that they can be effective global players in this fast-changing and rapidly developing software-development market.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, I would like to comment that in the nine years that I have been working in this Parliament I have never been lobbied by any acquaintance so aggressively, so often, so impolitely or so freely.
There must really be a lot at stake, although I can understand that people are worried.
The aim of this proposal is to harmonise the European regulations.
At present there is legal uncertainty on what is patentable and what is not in the area of software.
This is because the rules of the European Patent Convention are interpreted differently in the Member States and are not being tested.
This legal uncertainty has adverse effects in terms of the operation of the internal market.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is therefore positive about the aim of this proposal: recognition of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and more transparent rules.
It is illusory to think that no patents have been granted for software in Europe up to now.
The European Patent Office has awarded more than 30 000.
The directive now being proposed will not make patents for computer programs possible as such and will thus restrict the existing practices of the European Patent Office.
In general terms, nothing will be made patentable that was not patentable already.
The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is of the opinion that the directive must be strictly limited to unambiguous cases.
The condition of technical innovation is essential.
This is characteristic of an invention, as opposed to an idea.
Unlike in the USA, we want to prevent so-called trivial patents being awarded, for example on business matters.
The possibility of linking equipment in order to achieve interoperability is a method of achieving an open network and preventing the misuse of dominant positions.
I am therefore asking you to support the standpoint of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, article 6A of the report, and of course the other amendments as well.
Finally, I am asking for your support for the introduction of a grace period.
This will prevent an inventor from being cheated out of his invention if he publicises it in order to sound out interest in the market shortly before applying for the patent.
Mr President, Commissioner, this directive and this debate are horrifyingly complex, and also doubly complex, in both legal and computing terms.
The stakes, however, are extremely high: in economic terms, tens of billions of dollars, in philosophical terms, respect for human knowledge.
Throughout the 6 000 years of our history, it is by means of copying that the enormous body of human knowledge has increased.
The prerequisite was that access to the products of science, music, mathematics or of any other field should be free and without charge.
Copyright compensates the author without calling these principles into question.
When individuals use materials or harness natural forces, the costs change, the remuneration required is much higher, and patents make such remuneration possible by prohibiting the unremunerated use of the invention.
A piece of software is nothing more than a collection of mathematical formulae; the creation of new software can use hundreds of pieces of existing software.
Prohibiting or slowing down this creative development would constitute an attack on the dissemination of knowledge and nevertheless, in future, human knowledge will increasingly take the form of software.
The 1972 Convention prohibits the patenting of any software but the needs of big business, which has taken advantage of the vagueness of definitions, have led to a surge in the number of such patents.
The legal position of these thousands of patents is unclear and this is extremely dangerous for millions of individual creators or small businesses.
You were right to want to put an end to this.
We need a directive and your draft provides a good working basis, as you reiterated this morning.
You were right to insist and to write that this is not about extending the scope of patentability, as you stated in some quite recent articles.
We therefore support your motives, Commissioner, but as we have just heard, many of us, including my own group, consider that you have not followed your ideas through to their logical conclusion.
You conclude your recent article by this admirable phrase which I applaud: 'existing users of free software can continue to use this free of charge, regardless of future patents filed in this area'. Well done!
This is what we want to hear.
The technical provision of your directive, however, does not guarantee this freedom.
We have, therefore, tabled amendments that make a distinction between an invention and a pure product of the human mind.
The reference to materials and natural forces is not universally accepted and that is the subject of this debate.
And yet this reference is the only one possible for preventing companies that are powerful enough to create and protect an enormous portfolio of patents from capturing an infinitely expanding amount of knowledge.
When I read your words, Commissioner, I had the pleasure of thinking that you will agree with us and that you will thank us for having clarified your text.
Mr President, Mrs McCarthy, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my warm thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent work on this report.
Mrs McCarthy, you had to overcome two major problems not usually faced by rapporteurs.
Firstly, this is a highly complex topic, involving both legal issues and complicated technical matters.
Secondly, you also had to deal with a sometimes very aggressive, but sometimes also very irrational lobby, yet you ultimately managed to establish an ongoing dialogue, even though you undoubtedly found this difficult at times, as the rest of us did occasionally as well.
No, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want any general patenting of any software.
We do not want to strengthen the market power and monopolies of the software giants.
No, we do not want to threaten the commercial bases of small and medium-sized software companies.
And no, we do not want to undermine the successful open source community and Linux technology in any way.
So what do we want?
We want to make a sensible distinction between computer-implemented technical inventions, on the one hand - which must of course be patentable - and pure software for ordinary data processing, which should not be patentable, on the other.
It is true that in the past, the European Patent Office has handed out far too many patents far too lightly.
Mrs McCarthy has cited the most recent example of Amazon's 'one-click' shopping method.
However, only the legislator can bring this harmful trend to a halt.
It makes no sense whatsoever to be opposed to this directive, because then these practices will simply continue.
I am therefore at a loss to understand how anyone - especially the open source community - can be opposed to any form of directive in this area, as this would simply allow the current practice, which this community views very critically, to continue.
On the other hand, it is also true that an invention, in the classical sense, deserves to be protected by legislation.
The inventor has invested time and money in his invention, and it is of course quite unacceptable for the state to stand and watch while others exploit his ideas commercially.
In this area, the issue of the European Union's competitiveness must therefore also be discussed, for if we go so far in our directive that virtually every software element results in an invention no longer being patentable, we will be at a major disadvantage in the global competition for innovation.
We should be aware of this.
The proposal by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market improves the directive on key points.
It limits the tendency to issue patents too casually, which has been criticised here, and it does so more effectively than the Commission's original proposal.
The new Article 4A, with its negative examples, creates watertight protection against the patenting of software, because we are saying quite clearly that pure software cannot be patented, business methods cannot be patented, and algorithms and data processing cannot be patented either.
What we need is a European patent law to promote innovation, one that contains clear and sensible rules and draws a watertight border against pure software.
This directive achieves these goals.
Mr President, the Socialist Group does not believe that the amendments approved in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market reflect the current situation in the field of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions.
We must work on the basis that this is not a proposal for a Directive for patenting computer programs.
The system for those, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mr Rocard, has pointed out, is already regulated by means of a Community Directive.
We are talking about the field of intellectual creation, which have very different rules from those which govern the field of industrial protection.
Industrial protection, as Mr Rocard pointed out, relates to the application of industrial uses, and we already have well established rules.
What has happened here has been a very dangerous tendency on the part of United States jurisprudence, which has allowed purely intellectual creations, which do not have industrial applications as such, to be patented.
The attempt to establish a monopoly on computer programs by means of patents has caused justifiable indignation on the part of all those who are currently using the open network in Europe, and whose possibilities for action would be prejudiced.
It would represent a backward step in terms of European progress towards the creation of an information society as laid down in the Lisbon Declaration.
The Socialist Group therefore believes that the proposal for a Directive must be substantially modified, establishing very clear limitations, so as not to undermine the nature of industrial patenting.
We cannot end up in a situation here like the United States situation, in which there are currently certain companies which in practice are able to prevent all work in the field of computer programming.
As Mr Bolkestein has pointed out, the European Patent Office has allowed itself to take this dangerous route to a certain extent, as Japanese jurisprudence has also done, for example.
And that is precisely why we need a Community Directive.
We believe that intellectual property in the field of computers must be maintained and that we need a Community Directive which just regulates industrial applications, not computer programs, and which regulates it in a sufficiently clear way to prevent us from taking that route, so that the jurisprudence of the European Patent Office does not drag the countries of the European Union along the road of the patentability of computer-implemented inventions as such.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject we are discussing here is a difficult subject.
There is a big difference between copyright and patent law.
That this difference is difficult to define is evident from the amount of lobbying we have been experiencing. I therefore thank Mrs McCarthy, who has managed to clarify the line.
Particularly in her briefing to aggressive lobbyists who I think have incorrectly interpreted this and who want to achieve exactly the opposite of what is intended with this directive. That is regrettable.
The aim of this directive, in my view at least, is to prevent legal uncertainty.
Mr Medina Ortega and many other fellow MEPs have already given examples of this.
The European Patent Office in Munich is already using the United States method at the moment and is already patenting software as such.
I believe that it is necessary to put an end to this by way of this directive, if we get it.
I think that this is also what the lobbyists who want this directive voted down want.
I therefore think it is odd that they are calling for this directive to be totally rejected.
After all, this would make it possible for the US methods referred to by some fellow Members to remain in place and the Patent Office to continue to issue patents for thousands of software methods.
I think that would be a bad thing.
We have submitted a number of amendments. A large number of these have been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in the debate on the McCarthy report.
A large proportion of them relate to the protection of small- and medium-sized enterprises, while the purpose of others is to achieve improved definitions.
I therefore think that the report before us is already suitably balanced.
I would like to see a number of improvements implemented, however.
Among other things, I am referring to the grace period which my colleague Mrs Elly Plooij-Van Gorsel has already mentioned.
I think it would be a good idea to establish this in the directive.
I would even like to call upon the Commission to go further and include a grace period in all directives pertaining to intellectual property rights we may get in the future.
It seems to me to be a good thing for the not-so-powerful inventors in particular to be allowed such a period of time so that they can find out whether there is a market for their products.
I have also submitted an amendment concerning new inventions with software that is computer-implemented and which - to put it very clearly - is not patentable per se.
This amendment intends to set a limited period for new inventions, if you separate them from the software, which - to put it very clearly - is not patentable.
Why?
Because with a patent application, even if you do separate it and even if the product is not patentable per se, you have a number of legal procedures at your disposal with which you can keep businesses out of the market for a long time.
I think that would be a bad thing.
I am also of the opinion that such an approach does not conflict with the non-discrimination policy of TRIPS as it does not exclude a particular sector.
I think that it will simply be sending a clear signal.
Now a few words about interoperability.
Interoperability is necessary, but we must make a clear distinction between standalone inventions and inventions intended for use in conjunction with other inventions.
We have applied this distinction in our amendment.
I call upon fellow Members to support the directive in any event, in order to prevent legal uncertainty in the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the huge amount of work she has done.
It does sound as if we, in actual fact, all have the same intentions.
I should like to praise the Commission, and also the rapporteur, for having emphasised what the intentions are, namely to create still more development and still more investment in small- and medium-sized enterprises in this area.
What is odd is the simple fact that small and medium-sized enterprises are not pleased with this directive when those are what the intentions are.
Why are they not shouting with joy and, upon being consulted, using their answers to praise the proposal for a directive?
Why are small and medium-sized enterprises not demanding that we implement this directive in one go?
Why are all the software industry's innovators not demanding that we introduce this directive at breakneck speed?
Why are they doing almost the opposite?
That should, I think, in any case give rise to a certain amount of doubt as to whether we are in actual fact doing what we say we are doing.
The ostensible purpose of the directive is to ensure that rights can be enforced.
Being able, however, to enforce rights in this area or, perhaps, to protect oneself against others' maintaining that their own rights are being violated is so expensive that it is transparently obvious to small and medium-sized enterprises that this is not a method of progress for them.
Legal cases of this type cost approximately one million euros and are not the kind of thing that small and medium-sized enterprises can get directly involved in.
We say that we shall not extend the existing provisions.
That, I think, sounds wise, especially since the European Patent Convention does emphasise that software cannot be patented.
Let us, therefore, stick with that.
We are not in fact without rights now.
We have a legal basis in the form of the European Patent Convention.
The fact is, moreover, that the European Patent Office has extended the scope of its activities slowly and gradually.
If we were now to respond by legalising that extension, we should in fact be heading in the wrong direction.
We should then be heading in a direction in which it was more and more usual to demand patents on software, but not on pure software.
My question is therefore: how pure must software be before it is pure?
That is a question I have been in no position to obtain a clear answer to.
Moreover, it is perhaps precisely such questions that should be clarified before we take definitive action in this area.
I very much want to invite reflection.
I very much want to recommend that we allow doubts to be heard and that we listen to what the small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe have to say in this area.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will try to be brief, keep to the time available and not repeat anything that has already been said.
I will therefore begin by stating that I support, wholly and unequivocally, everything that has been said by the draftsman of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mr Rocard.
My group and I support the thrust of this directive, just as Mrs Frahm has already said.
You wanted to create legal certainty, and that is what we want as well, yet the Commission is wielding its rod against this directive's opponents and critics.
I almost heard a threat in your words, Commissioner Bolkestein!
None of us here is talking about software patentability here, oh no!
We are talking about computer-implemented inventions based on software.
You claim, and I quote, that opponents of the directive - I repeat, critics of this directive - have mounted a very vocal and, at times, even personal campaign based on half-truths and misconceptions.
In fact, what we tried to do was to avoid the massive lobbying and find some neutral and objective legal experts who could explain this very complex subject matter to us.
However, there is one simple question to which I have not yet heard an answer from you.
Even if only a tiny component within a solution - and after all, software does consist of a multitude of solutions - in a computer-implemented invention is patented, it is patented and I cannot use it freely.
As Mr Manders has said, we are running up against the border between copyright and patentability.
It is a difficult problem and I think that the proposals that have been devised in the opinions by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Culture are the basis for our decision-making.
By 'our', I mean the critical members here in this committee who want to pursue the same approach as you, Commissioner Bolkestein, but who are perhaps going further and thinking it through.
Possibly - as many legal experts have explained - this directive will not create any more legal certainty.
It may close a few loopholes, but open up others.
Let us be honest for once, ladies and gentlemen.
We all know the reality of the market.
We know how someone can use a patent as an instrument of market dominance and even as a weapon against his competitors, if he chooses to do so.
We should think very carefully about how we can protect both investment and innovation here.
We have a copyright directive dating from 1991; perhaps we should have revised it.
Perhaps there are points that can be brought up to date in legal terms.
If we had arrived at a conclusion based on the European Patent Convention in this matter, you would have my full support.
Nonetheless, I think the proposed amendments make a contribution here.
Last but not least, the European Patent Office and the unfair patents that may have been granted or that will be granted in future are primarily the responsibility of the signatory states.
It is laudable that Europe is showing responsibility here, but taking the first step on the basis of the European Patent Convention would have been enough, and then we could have given the matter further thought.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, information technology is the backbone of the future development of every country in the world and it is based on technology - hardware - and science - software.
At present, all technological innovations are protected by their patentability; but software development gives rise to copyright which protects its intellectual property.
To make this clearer, let me draw a parallel with the music world.
An electronic computer is an instrument which is used to create music, not composed of notes but of codes and commands, alternating with rhythm and a composed sequence, made by the developer, giving rise to different actions and results.
What would happen to music if, one day, you could patent scales, chords, trills and everything else that makes the world of classical music so rich and exciting?
Information technology would suffer the same fate: with patents, every command, every sequence of codes and algorithms would be protected, and the market transformed into a web of restrictions.
If all existing patents had to be validated, then all software development would be restricted, limited and increasingly inhibited, since all small and medium-sized enterprises and programmers would be forced to buy rights or licences and virtually pushed out of the market.
The intellectual property of a painting or a book is not protected by patenting the subject or argument, but by guaranteeing its distribution subject to copyright laws, stimulating other minds to produce original works, similar but not copies, improving, where possible, on the original work or reinterpreting it on the basis of different or more interesting models.
An expanding market, open to new horizons of lively criticism and fantasy, such as the European market, cannot allow itself to impose more regulations which would, in actual fact, further constrain development in the European nations.
We firmly believe that the McCarthy report cannot be accepted, since supporting it would seriously jeopardise the technological growth and development which can be generated only where people have a free spirit and mind.
Mr President, I am a trained architect and have worked as an architect all my life.
The problem we face in this case is like that which would arise from the introduction of patents in my own field.
Let us imagine that patents were taken out on stairs so that, in future, approval was needed and a licence had to be paid for before a house with stairs could be designed.
In a way, that would be a very good thing, since we should not then have all these wretched skyscrapers.
It is a grotesque idea, however, that an individual colleague of mine or a major firm within my industry should be able in some way to obstruct all development.
In the design and architectural work I have done, I have of course been protected by copyright law so that my work cannot be plagiarised.
In actual fact, it is the same with software and all other artistic activity which can of course be compared with the design of software programs in which the design itself is protected by copyright law.
Permitting the patenting of software in the EU would have negative consequences for the consumer, small and medium-sized enterprises, the whole 'open source' movement and innovation within the industry.
One would have to be more than usually naive to believe that innovation in the EU were being encouraged by allowing an American firm to take out a patent on the use of the special Danish letters ÃŠ, Ãž and Ã¥ in domain names, or that it would be of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises if, before they began to develop their product, they had to invest in a department concerned with legal matters relating to patents.
It should not be possible to patent either particular items of software or software per se.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission for the work they have carried out in all its difficulty.
The Radical Members of the Bonino List will vote in favour of the amendments seeking to restrict the margin of software patentability and will vote against the proposal as a whole if the main amendments are not adopted.
Why?
Because we do not believe in the need for European harmonisation, perhaps?
Not at all.
We support the Commissioner and the rapporteur in taking note of a situation whereby the European Patent Office has actually received thousands of applications for software patents.
In the light of such a clear violation of the spirit and letter of the European Patent Convention, what was needed, what would be needed, what is needed is clarification and confirmation that software is non-patentable.
Whilst the distinction between the patentability of software as such and the patentability of software as part of a computer-implemented invention is a subtle one - which means that we are running the risk of getting into a mess - the solution is, I believe, very clear: if a piece of software is an integral part of an invention, it is this invention that is patentable and is patented, not the software.
It is, however, already possible to do this through laws on computer-implemented inventions that are defined as such.
Software is excluded from patentability for a very specific reason, for the same reason that mathematic formulae are excluded, for the same reason that theorems are excluded, for the same reason that musical formulae and symphonies are excluded: these are all part of the field of ideas, of the organisation and transformation of ideas.
We know that a task that can be performed by software can be transformed into countless different types of codes by countless programmers using different programming languages.
This is what makes patenting software dangerous, and even more dangerous if the patent is to last for 20 years, which is a geological era in software development.
Independent programmers and programmers in general would now be authorised to use a function patented in 1983, the early history of computer software.
This is the danger.
I do not believe that it was necessary to venture into the realms of complex formulae to define the distinction between software as such and software as a part of computer-implemented inventions.
It would have sufficed to keep computer-implemented inventions as patentable and ensure respect for the regulations excluding software from patentability, which, in any case, provides for protection by copyright.
Hence our support for the amendments, in particular those on interoperability and those on the need for natural forces if software is to be considered an invention.
I also believe that we cannot adopt the proposal now because, if we do, the States will do their own thing.
We must try to do the best we can here.
I also believe that the involvement of hundreds of thousands of people who have all expressed their opinion on this issue individually should be seen as a democratic contribution, not an inconvenience.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that, of the many subjects dealt with in this term, the subject that we are dealing with this morning has, for me, been one of the most complex, and I must acknowledge the enormous amount of work that Mrs McCarthy has carried out.
I do not have all the answers and I understand the Commission's need - as Commissioner Bolkestein explained clearly - to speak on this issue.
I will, nevertheless, make a few remarks of a general nature, starting with the premise that we are dealing with an issue where identifying the subject of legal protection, and thus converting computer terms into legal terms and concepts, can already, in itself, be an extremely complex matter.
Now to a second point: we have, of necessity, to deal with a complex international legislative framework and, if we look at what is happening, not just in Europe but in the United States, in particular, the patent system is proving to have very many limitations, above all very many practical limitations.
Having said that, I believe that this directive, although there is room for improvement, has addressed a serious political issue facing the European Union.
We need to stand apart from the US positions and we may well also have to convince our main economic partners of the need for a measure harmonising all aspects of the legal protection of software in a form different from the current form.
In this, we are not starting from scratch, because the characteristics on which patents are based have already been clearly identified in the TRIPs agreements.
We therefore need to insist on the idea - from which we must not be moved - that software patents are only granted on solid grounds.
We have seen an abnormal number of applications for software patents in the United States, and there are probably just as many in the EU, and this makes it clear that we are not dealing with genuine inventive activity and that we cannot afford to grant every type of application a patent.
Furthermore, with the number of patent applications increasing uncontrollably, it will become virtually impossible to ascertain properly from the archives whether the application will genuinely lead to a new invention.
Of course, there are some legal aspects that could be improved upon; there are some discrepancies with Directive 91/250/EEC; we could certainly have reflected more from a legal point of view on Article 52 of the European Patent Convention, because one thing is certain: we will be forced to return to this issue because - as many Members have stated - development is so rapid that the European Union will have to adopt a measure in the next few years, when we will be able to revise our positions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is rare for our legislative activity to be the focus of so much public attention at such an early stage as Mrs McCarthy's report.
That has certainly not made it easier for her to complete her very demanding task, but it has generated a flood of information and arguments. Much of it was important and very informative, both for the rapporteur herself and for all of us.
However, mountains of paper were destined for the waste paper basket from the outset.
Our intensive work and the fact that it was monitored so closely by stakeholders has produced the compromise which I would encourage you to support and which is reflected in my group's proposed amendments.
It aims to release us from the pitfalls contained in Article 2 and Article 4, where a new definition of 'technical contribution' opened the way for the patenting of software.
Ladies and gentlemen, this loophole has now been closed to some extent.
Admittedly, I would have liked to have achieved more, and the small and medium-sized enterprises in particular had hoped for more.
Above all, I do not believe that we have made it sufficiently clear that we do not simply want to restrict software patents.
We actually do not want to grant any more of them in future at all. This is because software patents make life particularly difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises, to whom we have always pledged special protection and support.
To put it another way, anyone who patents software is playing into the hands of big business, not helping those with great intelligence.
Let us therefore send out a clear message which goes beyond this compromise solution. Say no to software patenting!
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I share the opinion of Messrs Rocard and Cappato and other fellow Members who think that software as such should not be patentable.
Article 52 of the European Patent Convention excludes software as such and states that ideas and theories are not suitable for patents.
It must be about technical innovation, and that is precisely the heart of the problem we are all facing.
It is also the heart of the directive.
The Patent Office recently concluded that all programs that run on a computer are technical by definition.
Under the Patent Office's current practices, it has already awarded more than 30 000 patents, many of which are not actually legally valid.
Mr Rocard has rightly mentioned that there is a difference between an invention based on the forces of nature and a product of the human intellect.
I am of the opinion that we must therefore support some of the amendments, which have also been submitted to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and also the amendments submitted to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport in the past.
These tighten the definition in such a way that, in my view, software as such is excluded.
If these amendments are not accepted, I will vote against the directive.
There is a good deal of disquiet among small- and medium-sized enterprises and the open source movement.
Human knowledge and the dissemination thereof is an important freedom which we in Europe must preserve.
This must be done if only on account of human dignity, but not solely for that reason.
We will be even more competitive than the United States and the directive will have to rule out the US situation completely.
I therefore hope that many of you will vote in accordance with this line so that we will get a directive that is workable.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning's debate follows a turbulent period in which the world of computer users, inventors and innovators has been fighting tooth and nail to protect its right to difference, freedom and creativity.
At the heart of this debate is patentability, with its advantages (when the patent rightly protects the inventor) and its major disadvantages, which involve often conservative monopolies being established to the detriment of young creators.
Personally, I still support this movement, which I believe follows the same approach as all alternative movements fighting for a less rigid and less commercial society.
Since this debate opened, we have scored points by tabling proposals for amendments that substantially improve the original draft.
Recognising that in order to be patentable, a computer-implemented invention must have an industrial application is a step in the right direction.
A statement to the effect that patents must not be granted for simple computer programs was needed.
Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the shades of meaning that have been introduced as well as the excessive vagueness.
At this point in the debate, even at the risk of seeing these amendments fail to receive the vote or then fail to be included, we must state that not all problems have been solved, by any stretch of the imagination.
I personally shall, therefore, be vigilant during voting and I remain willing to vote against the draft if the improvements prove to be nothing more than a cosmetic attempt to conceal the hold that large companies have over creative minds.
In this regard, Commissioner Bolkestein's last sentence, which smacks of blackmail, does nothing to alleviate my deep suspicion.
Mr President, many of the amendments - and certainly all those to which my group has given its name - are clearly and directly aimed at preventing any leakage from this directive into the patenting of computer software itself.
That is very important to us.
It is quite clear that a body of intellectual property law which protects computer software by copyright, and leaves patents for other purposes, works well from the point of view of the software industry, and of the creative minds which develop computer software.
Neither Mrs McCarthy nor Mr Bolkestein disagrees with me on this point.
Nobody wants a leakage resulting in the patenting of pure software.
There is some risk that genuine inventions which involve a software element would not be adequately protected without a new directive.
So be it.
But then the burden of proof lies with the Commission to show us which of Parliament's proposed amendments would over-protect us against the risk that we see and under-protect against the danger which the Commissioner is anxious to avoid, namely the danger of 'real' inventions not being adequately patentable within the European Union.
The strategy of those of us who are amending this directive is to prevent any leakage into software patents as such.
That would be a real disaster.
We have been lobbied heavily about this, but we have been lobbied heavily because we have very many able, hardworking constituents who see the leakage which I have mentioned as a threat to their livelihood.
Let us be absolutely sure that what we send back from this debate and from tomorrow's vote - and Mrs McCarthy has worked very hard on this report - really does provide a completely watertight seal against such leakage and protects what Mr Bolkestein wants to protect without creating the danger which so many of us have been taught to apprehend by our constituents.
Mr President, Commissioner, our starting point is also that we do not think that the patent is the right way to protect computer-implemented inventions.
Up to now, copyright has offered reasonable protection for this.
With the awarding of patents in this area we are running the risk of actually discouraging innovation and putting small- and medium-sized enterprises at a disadvantage, something that other people have already pointed out.
Regrettably, this discussion has actually been overtaken by the practices of the European Patent Office.
For years this office has been issuing so-called software patents, and these have already been enforced up to the highest international level.
The proposal that is now before us is really a sort of emergency measure designed to keep the awarding of patents in Europe within certain limits.
I have some sympathy for that.
The question is whether there is any point in doing so any more.
The European Patent Office has already awarded 30 000 patents on the basis of regulations which go further than the present proposal for a directive.
As far as that is concerned, this directive comes too late in the day.
On the positive side, the directive will lead to harmonisation and clarity in the Member States.
The danger that small, innovative businesses will lose out to the monopolies of the big ones will not go away, however.
This is inherent in the patent system.
We are sorely aware of this.
We therefore find the fact that the Commission and the rapporteur are laconically bulldozing over this here disturbing.
It proves that they have little affinity with European small- and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of our economy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the real issue here?
The real issue concerns protecting the intellectual property that is the result of innovations in computing.
There are two conflicting legal procedures in play: on the one hand patentability and on the other, copyright.
We and I believe the vast majority of speakers in this House, Commissioner, believe that the standard form of protection is copyright.
Whereas journalists or novelists know that their text is protected by copyright, they cannot then claim the syntax, the morphology, the vocabulary and the grammar of the language they are using as their own.
The same must apply to software, because software also uses language.
You claimed in your statement, Commissioner, which was extremely aggressive and even threatening with regard to the criticism inspired by your draft directive, that software as such was not covered by patentability.
You must not, however, treat people like idiots.
Furthermore, your directive is at best ambiguous, because your definition of a computer-implemented invention in Article 2(a), can just as easily apply to software.
Of course, in Article 4 of the draft directive, you appear to limit patentability to inventions, and I quote, 'susceptible of industrial application'.
This is a concept, however, that you have been very careful not to define.
We all know that US multinationals have managed to patent aspects as trivial as clicking a button to close a window on a screen, or the idea of alerting users by means of a tune to the fact that they have received an email, or even using a colour to underline words that need to be corrected when a text is revised - and textual revision is susceptible of industrial applications in typography or printing.
I will also mention the electronic 'shopping basket' used in e-commerce.
Young creators have even managed to patent the 35-hour working week imposed by the previous government of my country.
Why, then, is such a text being proposed in this Parliament?
Do the interests of the European Patent Office, which is funded according to the number of patents filed, have no part to play in this?
The fact is, Commissioner, that there was a strategic choice to make: either to fall in line with the patenting practice of US multinationals - which is what you appear to be starting to do - or to protect the specific characteristics of European law and refuse to let abusive patents have any effect.
You have clearly not taken the latter choice and it would be reasonable to believe that your directive does not tally with the legitimate interests of European creators.
Mr President, in all my time on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, this is the first time that I can recall that one of our major directives has received such prominence in the Parliamentary agenda.
I hope that trend will continue.
In fact the report was called so early that I was not here on time, and I apologise to both the Commissioner and the rapporteur for not being here to hear their speeches.
I have listened with interest to what Members have had to say and at this stage in the debate I would like to reflect on what this report is really all about.
We have an objective to create the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-driven economy in the world.
Patents are an indispensable part of that.
I want to remind all of you here, and everyone listening to this debate, that there are hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of people across the European Union working on inventions that have been protected by patents.
That patentability has stimulated investment to develop those inventions into products that the world wants to buy.
What we are talking about here is a regime that is legitimately going to encourage invention in all fields.
Part of the problem we have had in dealing with this is that a lot of the issues that have been raised have come from one particular direction of creativity: writing elements of computer programs.
Actually, patents are about protecting a genuine invention, a new way of doing something, something that is - as this directive says - susceptible of industrial application.
I would like to remind colleagues that when you apply for and are granted a patent it does not have to include all the details.
In today's world almost every technical and industrial innovation requires some form of computer-aided activity.
Why should we deny protection to people who are working on inventions in that field?
The Commission has made a persuasive case, supported by a lot of research, that we need a consistent framework so as to ensure that people know that they can get patents for these types of invention.
They will also know that they cannot get patents for trivial business process inventions that should not under any circumstances be patented, and will be discouraged from applying for them.
We know this is difficult to do, which is why we have argued about the wording.
That is why Mrs McCarthy has done such a good job as rapporteur on this directive.
She has consistently seen the importance of this in a knowledge-driven economy and has led us in looking at ways of improving and making this work better.
She has not allowed herself to be diverted by all the noise around her.
I hope that you will support this directive, and that you will support the thrust of the Legal Affairs Committee's amendments.
There will be some other amendments but I hope you will resist some of the complicated and abstruse concepts that have been put forward by some people which will make an inventor's life far harder.
It is invention and creativity that we are here to support and nothing else.
Mr President, this is a political chamber and I believe that as a political chamber the first question we should consider, as should the Commission, is why this proposal has caused so much commotion and so much reaction.
It is not fair to discredit any person not agreeing with it and to say that there has been aggressive opposition on the part of lobby groups.
Because, at least on the part of those who have been in contact with me, university teachers of information technology, experts in patents and industrial property and also representatives of small businesses, what I have heard, rather than aggression, has been concern; concern at the way things are progressing and the danger being faced in terms of the possibilities for inventions.
The people who advocate this initiative tell us that the only intention is to unify practice on the part of the national patent offices, in a field in which there have recently been contradictory resolutions.
And that is true; what is not true, or at least what is not certain, and please allow us to accept this intellectual doubt at least, Commissioner, is that this proposal for a Directive is going to resolve the problems which the intention is apparently to resolve.
Because it is very easy to do so, the practice of the European Patent Office, in a break with what was the traditional approach of European law, has tended towards a practice very similar to that in United States law.
All the honourable Members know, all the experts know, that European law demands that an invention must be of an industrial nature if it is to be patentable, which means that not only must the method be industrial, but also the result of the product must be industrial, while in US law it is sufficient for it to have a useful application.
This has allowed certain innovations and certain patents of software programs.
We therefore insist on this point.
It makes no sense to say that with the report of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Commission's proposal these problems are resolved, because they are resolved by means of the amendments approved in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Therefore, if the amendments such as those proposed by the Committee on Industry and the Committee on Culture are not approved, it will be very difficult for us to support this proposal.
Will we all still be able to use our computers in the future without having to pay patent rights to do so?
This is the question that is occupying all our minds.
What we do not want is the United States situation, one in which patents can be granted on simple computer languages or software.
We are, however, less able to agree with each other when it comes to describing this.
We also often lag behind reality; you just have to look at what is happening at the European Patent Office.
We cannot therefore afford to postpone this any further and must seek proper clarification of what is patentable and in particular of what is not.
Personally I think that the right balance has been found in the standpoint of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and in the amendments put forward by my colleagues Mr Manders and Mrs Plooij.
Any form of software is explicitly excluded from patenting.
Only genuine inventions must be patentable.
They must thus involve a worked-out technical process with industrial applications and not simply an idea or a language.
The piece of technology that contains this new technical process must then be protected. Not the fact that you need a computer to use it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of things I do not understand.
I am not sure, for example, that I understand the reasons for deciding to draft this directive.
If this is simply a problem for the European Patent Office and for applications for patents, I believe that this is really quite a limited starting point.
What is completely beyond me is that the European Commission, which is so concerned about preventing concentrations in industry, is proposing - if we are to believe a number of experts - support for industrial concentration.
This appears to contradict the Commission's objectives.
Nor do I understand the amnesia we are seeing here with regard to the disastrous directive on patenting life.
No one knows how to implement this directive and its validity is universally questioned.
Can one patent the cells of a leaf without patenting the leaf itself?
The problem of software and of technical contributions is identical.
The legal uncertainty we faced with regard to the directive on patenting life reappears in connection with the patenting of software, programmes and technical contributions.
I am struggling to find the right words because the directive gives no clear definition of a technical contribution.
In light of these uncertainties, I find it hard, Commissioner, to understand what is happening here.
Mr Rocard referred to 6 000 years of history, but history has speeded up as rapidly in the field of biotechnologies as in those of software and computing.
Are we going to be able to pursue these rapid developments when economists are predicting that we will have a number of problems to face?
In the field of pharmaceuticals, we are told, it is easier to see what is an innovation and it is easier to determine what is covered by copyright or a patent.
With regard to software, it is still extremely hard to tell.
Publishers and teachers fear that this type of directive threatens the knowledge-based society, transparency and the circulation of information.
I thought that the European Commission and Europe had made preventing such threats one of their aims.
I do not understand what is going on here.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been heavy lobbying around this report because there is much at stake.
I understand this very well and I share this concern.
This directive, which is probably well-intentioned, is a threat to scores of small- and medium-sized enterprises in Europe who are at risk of losing their creativity as a result of all these patents.
These small- and medium-sized enterprises are the avant-garde of the business sector.
We must nurture these small- and medium-sized enterprises because they deliver innovation.
This innovation enables us to maintain our position in the world market.
We are against this directive because it represents over-regulation.
The present protection offered by copyright is sufficient.
We Greens are often reproached as being busybodies.
Well, here is the proof that we are not.
As a matter of fact, there is talk in the USA of toning down patent laws, which are regarded as counterproductive.
So why should we have to approve an outdated law in Europe?
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and the rapporteur from our group, Mr Wuermeling, for the effort they have made to reach a consensus and, in the case of Mr Wuermeling, to explain the complicated proposal within our group.
The protection of computer-implemented inventions by means of patents is not a new problem and it must be made clear, as other Members have said in this House, that there is no intention to establish rules allowing computer programs to be patented, but to extend the classic doctrine of patents to computer-implemented inventions.
We want to apply the existing arrangements for patents to computer-implemented inventions.
It is clear that we must expressly exclude, as certain amendments do, the patentability of inventions solely because they use a computer.
With regard to the scope, I would like to focus on a very specific aspect: that of interoperability.
Interoperability and communication between programmes should be excluded from the scope of this Directive.
This aspect should be reviewed in a few years time.
The exclusive use which the law allows holders of patents obliges the holder to explain their invention so that it may be comprehensible to an average expert in the field.
I believe that in this case as well we must stress this aspect and oblige the person applying for a patent to sufficiently explain the object of that patent, though perhaps not until the publication of the source code, as Mr Harbour has said.
That would be excessive.
As I have said, it is especially important in this field to oblige applicants to describe their invention.
Finally, many people have criticised this proposal and have said that it may harm small- and medium-sized businesses.
However, what we are doing is applying traditional patent law to small- and medium-sized businesses, in the knowledge that patents have increased growth and have made it possible for all types of companies - including small ones - to carry out research and invest in new developments.
We are competing today in a globalised market in which the United States and Japan develop many patents and inventions.
We cannot be left behind and we must regulate here in Europe as well the possibility of registering computer-implemented inventions as patents.
Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for her work because I feel that - as this morning's debate has confirmed - this is a very complex, sensitive issue.
As has already been said, software plays an important role in countless industries; it is a basic form of creation and expression.
Software is, in addition, a field of specialised engineering and a basic human activity, with more than ten million professional developers throughout the world and tens of millions of people creating software.
Independent software developers and small businesses play a fundamental role in innovation in this area, above all in Europe.
Europe is at the forefront of the culture of information technology: 71% of open source software developers work in Europe and only 13% in the US.
Patents should not, therefore, permit the monopolisation of tools for the expression, creation, dissemination and exchange of information and knowledge, must not hold back the development of research and knowledge.
The stakes are considerable because this is a matter of guaranteeing that research and innovation continue to be free and - according to the spirit of Lisbon - to stimulate economic growth based on knowledge, to bring about the stimulation of software-based innovation and inventions at all levels and to avoid production and trade monopolies for products that use the software.
Thus, some fundamental points of the Commission proposal need to be modified and improved on, so that the regulation is a step towards clear, severe limitation of the conditions for patentability.
A great deal has been said about technical contribution, industrial application, the meaning of computer-implemented invention; the conditions for the industrial use of an invention based on software filed for a patent must be extended to the product as well as the method.
This is why Commissioner Bolkestein said that he is concerned that the amendments tabled in this House will be adopted, For my part, I have to say that I am concerned that, if they are not adopted, we will not be able to support the proposal on the table.
Mr President, our debate today is of the utmost importance not only for software developers in the European Union, but also for all those with an interest in knowledge.
This is because, by proposing the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, the Commission is preparing the ground for the patentability of human knowledge.
It goes without saying that human knowledge cannot become the birthright of large multinationals, which are almost synonymous with Microsoft in this case.
We all know that this proposal for a directive responds neither to the economic, scientific and cultural challenges facing the software sector, nor to the imperative to promote innovation, technological development or the interests of SMEs.
We know how important it is to maintain a supply of free software, and how important it is to give the public sector tools for developing a content and service industry, in order to protect the common interest.
For that reason, and to give voice to the strong opposition of scientists and software publishers, this proposal for a directive must be rejected.
I hope that this plenary will send a clear message by approving the proposal for a rejection, which I endorse and which was tabled by my group.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a directive which regulates the uniform application of the law by patent offices and patent tribunals is to be welcomed unreservedly in the interests of a well-functioning internal market and for the sake of avoiding distortions of competition.
However, we must not forget that the development of new software must not be impeded, the position of SMEs must not be made more difficult, that we must create legal certainty, and that we want to prevent new distortions of competition.
I took every letter and every discussion very seriously.
Some fears are rooted in misinterpretations.
Some points of criticism are based on American realities and not on the content of the directive.
However, I do endorse some of the arguments.
The European Patent Office is violating the laws between EPAT, the Member States and the European Patent Convention.
The definition of 'technical contribution' is too vague.
A clear distinction between technical and intellectual inventions is required.
I therefore support some of the amendments and compromises proposed by my friend Mr Wuermeling and the rapporteur.
I would like to thank my fellow Member Mrs Echerer for the large quantity of material that she supplied.
I support some of the amendments proposed by my colleague Mrs Kauppi: Amendments Nos 107 and 108, which clearly define the term 'field of technology', Amendments Nos 112, 114 and 117, which make it clear that computer programs do not, in themselves, constitute patentable inventions, Amendment No 116 on the limits of patentability, and Mr Wuermeling's compromises in which reference is made to the current EPAT legal framework and there is a clarification to the effect that trivial inventions and business methods are not patentable.
I hope that we can all live with these amendments.
Mr President, in the absence of a clear legal framework, the rise of the abusive and opportunistic exploitation of legal provisions designed to protect patents, with the aim of profiting from advances made in information technology to do business, constitutes an unacceptable way of privatising human knowledge.
Privatising knowledge in a field which cannot, even in the broadest terms, be confused with that of technical and industrial inventions simply means creating new business opportunities.
Progress in information technology results, by definition, in advances which are as a rule unpatented, or which cannot be patented by anyone in particular, being added to the sum of knowledge.
The right to make a profit of those who are most assiduous in appropriating common property should not be protected by law, much less should their interests take precedence over the interests of the general public, the interests of the economic and scientific communities, and the interests of civilisation, in knowledge not being commercialised.
The application of true software inventions, resulting from investments, to the process of production should, of course, be protected.
There is a world of difference, however, between protecting these legitimate interests and using that protection as a pretext to patent software indiscriminately.
The proposal on the table today, with the compromise amendments suggested by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, manages to reconcile these different concerns in an acceptable way.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to start by expressing my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, and our shadow rapporteur.
Ladies and gentlemen, do we really need this directive?
Like many other Members, I too have received many worried letters expressing serious concerns about the Commission proposal.
I have taken these concerns very seriously, because no one wants to stand in the way of innovation in Europe or impose additional burdens, especially on the small and medium-sized IT companies.
After weighing up all the pros and cons of this directive, however, I am convinced that we will make the right decision tomorrow if we adopt this directive with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and various other clarifications.
We need this directive.
It is simply designed to harmonise existing practice governing the granting of patents in Europe, and in this context, more stringent criteria are to be adopted, particularly for the granting of patents.
I have a number of reasons for supporting the directive.
