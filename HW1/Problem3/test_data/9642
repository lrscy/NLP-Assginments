I should like to thank the Socialist Group in this European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, who have signed this agreement, for their support, and let me say that I hope that other groups will follow suit.
Unanimity is important if we are to send out a strong message to the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  Madam President, Minister, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, ladies and gentlemen, if we are on the verge of reaching agreement with the Council on such a sensitive proposal in second reading today, it is mainly thanks to the excellent work and, if I may say so, perseverance of your rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool.
My warmest congratulations to you, Madam.
May I remind you of the approach underlying the proposal for a directive.
Its main purpose is to find answers to the imbalance and potential inefficiency facing the European transport system today.
These problems were identified in the White Paper on the common transport policy.
Our response is to say that if transport users are gradually made to carry the costs of the transport they use, that will help to reduce pollution and congestion and release further funding for investment in transport infrastructures.
The text we are examining today amends the present directive, which dates from 1999 and provides a framework for the imposition of tolls and user charges on Europeâs motorways.
The present directive is both restrictive and ineffective.
Restrictive because it prohibits the imposition of tolls on any road infrastructure other than motorways.
It also stipulates that infrastructure costs are the only factor to be used in calculating the level of tolls.
It is nevertheless ineffective because it does not specify any method for implementing these provisions.
The lack of a method of calculating infrastructure costs is detrimental to fair competition and encourages discriminatory treatment of users.
The Commission has proposed several amendments in response to this situation.
First of all, a geographical coverage extending to all the trans-European road network.
Then, a start should be made â only a start, it is true, but a start nonethelessÂ âÂ at taking account of external costs: restrictions on the practice of discounts, and the introduction of the principle of earmarking toll receipts.
While Parliament was able to give its opinion swiftly in first reading, the Council, Minister, found it more difficult to reach a decision.
It took four meetings of the Council to come to an agreement, and I in turn would like to thank you.
It is understandable that transit states want to pass more of the external costs of road transport on to users.
Peripheral states, for their part, want to ensure that transport will play its part in integrating their national economies into the single market, and this difference in stance between transit states and peripheral states makes discussion difficult, but it has also enabled us to find this compromise.
Since then, the three institutions have been working very hard to reach an agreement in second reading.
Thanks to the European Parliamentâs amendments and thanks to you, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, significant improvements have been made.
The text that is now on the table brings us back to the concerns to which the Commission has drawn attention in the form of declarations.
The first is about the stage you have reached on the road to internalising external costs.
Under the new directive, a toll mark-up will allow a partial internalisation of external costs and may be applied in mountain areas.
The proceeds of this mark-up will have to be used to fund alternative transport infrastructures.
The new directive will also allow greater variation in tolls to take account of vehicle pollution or road congestion.
Finally, on the subject of analysing the internalisation of external costs, I am pleased to say that the Commission will be able to prepare and publish the models and impact analyses requested by Parliament in the next two years.
The Commission will be able to assess the need for further Community action on that basis.
The second concern is this directiveâs geographical coverage.
On this point, the new directive will allow the Member States to apply tolls and user charges to all roads.
Your amendments also seek to ensure that when the Member States apply tolls they follow clear principles for their calculation so that they are fair, non-discriminatory and consistent with Community law.
So far as the possibility of a toll mark-up in urban areas is concerned, the compromise you propose is reasonable.
It is perfectly clear that if the Member States wish to introduce urban charging systems in order to reduce pollution and congestion, they are free to do so, and the example of London seems most interesting in this regard.
Finally, on the question of the vehicles covered by the future directive, you have defined the timetables for including vehicles over 3.5 tonnes within the scope of the directive and the exemptions from it.
These are wise proposals that will allow the directive to be implemented better.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has no difficulty in welcoming Parliamentâs amendments, which reflect the compromise negotiated between our three institutions.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am very pleased to be here in Strasbourg to represent the Council at your last part-session of 2005.
I am grateful to you for the opportunity to say a few words in your debate on the Eurovignette dossier.
When Mr Darling addressed the Committee on Transport and Tourism in June he said that the UK would do all it could to secure an agreement between the Council and Parliament during our Presidency.
However, he also warned that this would not be easy because the Council had little room for manoeuvre.
I know that this is also true for Parliament.
I am therefore very pleased that Parliament and the Council have been able to work together to bring this important and highly political dossier to what, I hope, will be a successful conclusion.
I particularly congratulate Mrs Wortmann-Kool, your rapporteur, for her hard work and the dedication to find an agreement acceptable to both Parliament and the Council.
The amendments to the existing directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles will make a real difference.
In particular, they will allow Member States to do the following: levy charges on all roads rather than just motorways; charge goods vehicles down to 3.5Â tonnes and not just vehicles of more than 12Â tonnes; benefit from much more scope to vary tolls to influence hauliersâ behaviour to reduce congestion and pollution; impose a mark-up in mountainous regions to combat congestion and pollution and raise new funds for major trans-European network projects.
The directive will provide for the Commission to develop a model for the assessment of external costs in no longer than two years.
This model, together with an impact assessment, will, if appropriate, allow the Commission to bring forward a proposal for further amendment of the Eurovignette directive.
I am sure that I do not need to say that these are important achievements on a new directive which will balance the interests of the peripheral states and transit countries, hauliers, environmentalists and, most of all, will benefit the citizens of Europe.
I should like to congratulate all concerned once again for managing to find a compromise that satisfies both the Council and Parliament.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I have here the draft voting list for the Wortmann-Kool report on the charging of heavy goods vehicles.
The draft is extremely simple, and I hope that it remains so.
We can say âyesâ to the compromise negotiated by the rapporteur during the informal trialogue.
Doing so will enable us to conclude one of the very difficult European transport dossiers this year, at second reading, whilst striking a balance between Europeâs requirements as a business location â with free movement of goods in the internal market of 25 and more â and an infrastructure costs directive that also takes very much better account than previously of environmental concerns and the health of the people having to live along European transport routes.
If we say ânoâ we shall see a different situation; there would then be a great risk of our dismissing the legislative mandate as a failure and returning to national level.
My group, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and, I hope, most of the other political groupings in this House will support the rapporteurâs proposals, both because they are good and in recognition of the rapporteurâs work.
With this dossier, she has shown that even Sisyphean tasks can be completed successfully.
I am much obliged to MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool.
I am also much obliged to Commission Vice-PresidentÂ Barrot.
He and his staff have brought great expertise and even greater commitment to bear to promote and facilitate this compromise.

I am also much obliged to the British Presidency.
I cannot imagine that it has received much praise over the last six months, but here it is deserved.
In conclusion, I should like to say a few words as an Austrian.
Fifteen years ago, we set ourselves the objective of reshaping European transport policy to include regard for environmental and health concerns.
At that time, we received pitying smiles.
Now, the day has come.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, politics was once defined as the art of the possible.
If this definition is true, Parliament has made full use of its possibilities in the face of the widely differing interests in our countries, and also in our parties.
We are particularly obliged to the rapporteur for her excellent negotiating skills.
Why is this legislation so fundamentally important to us Social Democrats?
It brings about a Europe-wide changeover to a system of transport infrastructure costs and thus to fairer user financing of the infrastructure that is calculated on a uniform basis.
Differing toll rates and arbitrariness will now be a thing of the past in Europe.
At the same time, the legislation means embarking on the âpolluter paysâ principle, with which we wish to make progress, including by charging for external costs, by the end of this parliamentary term â as both the Commissioner and the Council have told us.
Embarking on a system of traffic management via variable toll rates and the fact that these are to be variable fromÂ 2010 is important to us in transport-policy terms.
This constitutes a real gain in quality.
Toll mark-ups in sensitive regions can be used for cross-subsidising environmentally friendly modes of transport, and it is also possible to add toll mark-ups in conurbations and charge tolls on parallel and diverted traffic, which is a current problem in Germany in particular.
From 2012, charging tolls on lorries weighing 3.7Â tonnes or more will be the rule.
The burden of proof for exceptions rests with the Member States, and we have defined these fairly narrowly.
I am sure that good transport-policy sense will rule out any exceptions, as the shift in the volume of freight transport to lorries weighing under 12Â tonnes in Germany has now resulted in an artificial increase in traffic volume there.
I think that we can support this compromise, which we have all achieved together, as a whole, and I eagerly await the next steps we shall take and the discussions we shall hold together here in Parliament on the internalisation of external costs.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am here above all to state my support for the compromise achieved and to recommend colleagues to vote in favour of it.
Obviously we could â or perhaps should â have gone further.
Charging for infrastructure will yield all its benefits only when two principles can be fully combined: the principle of âthe polluter paysâ â and on the roads negative effects arise in terms of the environment, safety and congestion â and the broader principle of 'the user pays'.
Only by combining these two principles can the two aims be made to converge, namely allocation, which in our case means influencing the modal shift, and recovery of the inherent cost of charging.
Todayâs compromise only provides for application of the âuser paysâ principle.
In terms of âthe polluter paysâ we shall just have to be satisfied with the fact that the shift from financing infrastructure out of general taxes to financing it at least partially out of tariffs is a precondition for any internalisation of external costs, which we have been promised after yet another in a long series of evaluations by the Commission, which, as we have been repeatedly told, will be completed within the next two years.
However, there are also other types of reference in the measure to the principle of âthe polluter paysâ.
The reference is clear where variations in the amount of the toll are permitted in relation to the emission category to which the vehicles belong and to the day or time of use of the infrastructure, or rather less obvious where the possibility of a toll mark-up is allowed where a route crosses sensitive areas such as mountainous regions.
Incidentally, this latter rule can certainly help overcome difficult situations such as that currently affecting the section between Turin and Lyon in the Susa Valley.
Paradoxically, however, this directive addresses environmental problems, congestion and safety most effectively through a surrender of competence: it has been decided not to treat urban areas in the same way as sensitive mountain regions, yet on the other hand the full compatibility of the Eurovignette has been recognised, with urban tolls Ken Livingstone being used directly to regulate congestion and combat pollution.
It is a first step; let us just be grateful for that.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision on a ceiling for tolls that we shall be taking on Thursday is also a decision on a missed opportunity: that much must be made clear.
Tolls are a hot issue.
We also had very heated debates and close votes in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
One issue was central, and that was transport costs; that was the issue that most inflamed passions.
In particular, it encountered the strongest resistance from Transport Ministers.
It is essential to charge for these external costs if we are serious about wanting to protect health and the environment; these costs have to be charged to polluters at long last.
For, currently, the European taxpayer is paying these costs and, furthermore, for this very reason, the railways find it difficult or impossible to make themselves competitive.
We did make some progress during our negotiations with the Council, but too little.
Nevertheless, I should like to thank the rapporteur and also my colleagues for this progress.
We shall be able to support a large proportion of what has been negotiated, but not the loopholes, of which there are the following: Germanyâs derogation from the obligation to charge tolls for vehicles weighing up to 12Â tonnes â that will be a lengthy job, I fear â and Italyâs multiple-driver bonus, which will also be a lengthy job.
All of this just because the Transport Ministers did not listen to the man on the street, but only to lobbyists from the HGV transport industry.
Â Â  . Madam President, lorry traffic has kept on becoming cheaper for the users, but society as a whole is paying an ever-higher price for it.
We pay for it in the shape of air pollution, noise pollution and the excessive space that it takes up.
That is why a drastic shift away from roads to rail and water is necessary, as is the reduction of needless transport.
One of the means of achieving this is for road transport to pay for all pollution itself and thus to become more expensive than rail transport.
Switzerland is a good example in this respect.
The compromise proposal for charging toll is better than the directive we have at the moment, but too many loopholes and exceptions have crept in.
There is every likelihood that Member States will wait for the Commissionâs promised calculation model, which will require the go-ahead from the Council and Parliament in two yearsâ time.
As a result, interested governments will try to put off passing on the environmental costs .
The most polluting trucks are exempt until 2010.
Smaller lorries under 12 tonnes fall outside of the directiveâs scope until 2010, and Member States can simply exempt these lighter vehicles.
There is also no guarantee whatsoever that the toll proceeds will be ploughed back into sustainable means of transport, such as freight railways.
Member States can, if they so wish, invest the full amount in asphalt.
My group would have liked to endorse amendments that are geared to more and quicker results, which this compromise does not cater for.
The main thing is that at least now a start has been made on the introduction of this desperately needed toll charge on lorry traffic.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Eurovignette dossier contains a few tricky areas, including the 3.5 tonne lower limit, extra taxes, external costs and profit spending.
In my view, reference to external costs is this dossierâs key asset, without which it would be impossible to calculate the integral costs for all modes of transport in a bid to achieve the desirable goal of a level playing field.
I am pleased to see that the Councilâs sense of reality has prevailed over considerations of strict business economics.
The agreement on external costs is at the same time the greatest loss.
After all, the Council has not yet given 100% confirmation in respect of whether external costs will be included in future pricing.
For that reason, I would like to urge the Commission to do what is necessary and go full speed ahead with the study into external costs, so that this discussion can be continued on the basis of more specific material and brought to a satisfactory close within the foreseeable future.
Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result achieved and on the way in which this was brought about.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I cannot support Mrs Wortmann-Koolâs report.
Despite all her valiant efforts, her work is a series of assumptions which clearly do not support the introduction of the Eurovignette.
This is a worrying new tax which the Union is seeking to impose â this time on commercial road transport â in the absurd belief that it will help to re-level the competitive playing field with rail transport, producing those environmental benefits to which we all aspire.
I would also like to take this opportunity to condemn what is happening in the Susa Valley in Italy, where those who should be giving energetic support to rail transport, as they did with the decisions on corridors, are now trying to place obstacles in its path, moreover using somewhat questionable methods.
Basically, I view the Eurovignette as the first obvious direct tax which the European Union wishes to impose and which could open the door to other unacceptable taxes.
I shall therefore vote against the proposal.
Â Â  Madam President, yet again I am forced to rise in this House to speak on a report which will increase costs for both consumers and businesses alike.
The problems I have with the Eurovignette are both technical and relate to reasons of principle.
In issues of taxation of this nature the European Union has no competence.
These matters are rightly the purview of Member States, and, before I am corrected, let me say that the Eurovignette is a tax, not a toll, since the Commission proposes hypothecating revenue from what can only be called a stealth tax.
This goes way beyond its remit.
I am sure the President-in-Office will confirm that in the UK alone over GBPÂ 40Â billion is taken in road-related taxes, yet only GBPÂ 8Â billion is reinvested in the transport infrastructure â far from being tax-neutral.
If I know national governments well, the end result of this proposal would be tantamount to double taxation.
This is only the thin end of the wedge.
The Eurovignette is the precursor to tolling on all vehicles.
I fundamentally oppose such measures.
We already have iniquitous levels of taxation in the road sector, and this is no different.
Not to mention the âbig brotherâ approach that is being taken to how this will eventually be implemented.
On technical matters, the internalisation of external costs offers no verifiable scientific evidence to support the claims being made.
To try and build into legislation arbitrarily such issues as environmental damage, which cannot be calculated with any confidence, is plainly ludicrous.
The European Union is consistent in its claims to promote competition and competitiveness, yet it is just as consistent in failing to do so.
Mr Barroso is keen to tell us he wants to scrap many existing and proposed regulations.
Here he, and you, Mr Barrot, have one of the most excellent opportunities to do so, by scrapping this whole proposal.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, we shall not, of course, be following MrÂ Bradbournâs suggestion.
I am pleased that you, a skilled environmental politician, are present to see us make good progress with a European sustainable transport policy by adopting the infrastructure costs directive.
Of course, we have not yet reached the end of the road; we are a long way from achieving our objective.
The fact that we have come as far as we have, however, is due in large part to my colleague MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool.
Therefore, I offer her my compliments and my sincere thanks.
I should like to discuss two important points.
We are discussing freight transport, and we cannot restrict ourselves to lorries weighing 40, 12 or 7.5Â tonnes or more here, but want vehicles weighing 3.5Â tonnes or more to be subject to tolls.
It is then up to the Member States, too, to meet their responsibilities.
In addition, we know that the costs of freight transport far exceed those of just constructing and repairing roads.
The external costs for users must be calculated at long last, therefore, and can no longer be dressed up.
It is quite possible to calculate these external environmental, noise, congestion and health costs, even if my colleague MrÂ Bradbourn takes a different view.
According to a study, transport by road incurs external costs of EURÂ 88 per thousand tonne-kilometres, whereas the figures for transport by rail and inland waterway are EURÂ 19 and EURÂ 17, respectively.
According to very conservative estimates, external costs make up at least 60% of infrastructure costs.
The compromise envisages that we meet again in two yearsâ time.
Therefore, the compromise entails a very great responsibility and obligation for the Commissioner.
That is, we are expecting to see not only the model, but also legislative proposals in two yearsâ time, and I can already anticipate the quarters from which he will have to fend off the arrows.
We shall hear arguments along the lines that this is not serious, is scientifically untenable and, if need be, puts jobs at risk.
That is why I ask the Commissioner to make courageous proposals.
The vast majority in Parliament will support you in this.
Â Â  Madam President, in order not to repeat what other Members have said, I would like to stress a couple of collateral aspects.
Firstly, this directive responds to the profound imbalances in the transport system, within which road transport is progressively increasing its share and is in danger of collapse.
Meanwhile, there are certain other forms of transport that are losing share and volume, as in the case of goods by rail.
I believe that railways are a more sustainable and less polluting means of transport than lorries, and that we must discriminate positively in their favour until they can manage by themselves.
Goods transport by rail is still subordinate to passenger transport by rail and its average speed is therefore not very competitive.
We must construct more sections of line exclusively for goods and, if we do that, we will enjoy clear economic and environmental benefits in the medium term.
The second aspect relates to the need to promote the interoperability of European toll systems.
There are stretches of our network in which, within little more than twenty-five kilometres, there are five motorway toll stations, which inevitably increases congestion.
We are still awaiting the proposed legislation in this regard from the Commission.
Let us hope that it does not take five years.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as a German MEP, I strongly condemn Germanyâs veto on the internalisation of external costs with the âeurovignetteâ and on the extension to all lorries weighing 3.5Â tonnes or more.
It harms the railways, which cannot withstand the unfair competition between rail and road, and whose market share, according to the McKinsey study, will fall from 14% today to 9% if the privileges of the roads are not dismantled.
The German right-left coalition government has pushed through huge loopholes enabling each Member State to charge the toll only on 12-tonne lorries, which make up only 10% of such vehicles.
The railways will be decisively weakened as a result, because in Germany there is a railway toll for all trains on all tracks in the form of train-path prices.
On the roads, this applies only to lorries weighing 12Â tonnes or more, and that only on the motorways.
Unfair competition is not being ended, but reinforced.
Neither Germany nor Europe will achieve the Kyoto objectives like this.
The German blockade renders the shift from road to rail impossible.
This directive means that there is no future for the European railways.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, by drafting a report on this extremely complex directive, the rapporteur has very ably guided us through an area of legislation that at times resembles nothing so much as a minefield.
One question remains, however.
Has the rapporteur led us to the goal we have set ourselves?
Needless to say, this goal is to improve transport infrastructure, and by this I mean not only improvements to road infrastructure.
Related goals include cutting traffic jams, reducing the number of accidents and limiting emissions of harmful substances.
We would only be able to answer this question in the positive if there were a guarantee â I repeat, a guarantee â that all of the revenue from the Eurovignette would be earmarked for transport-related objectives.
Yet no such guarantee has been given.
Those Members who have commented, both today and on other occasions, that these charges may well be used as a stealth tax by the Member States were therefore entirely right to do so.
It goes without saying, of course, that the rapporteur could not do anything to settle this issue, since it is unquestionably covered by the subsidiarity principle.
At the same time, however, if we suffer a defeat on this matter, and if the Member States bail themselves out by using revenue from the Eurovignette to plug the holes in their budgets, the whole point of these new regulations will be undermined.
I would therefore call on the European Commission to monitor the way in which revenue from the Eurovignette is spent as closely as possible.
It would also be a good idea for Parliament to be informed of any irregularities in this regard.
At this point, I should like to remind Commissioner Barrot that this directive is his brainchild too.
He should attend to it with particular devotion, and lavish care and attention on it.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank Mrs Wortmann-Kool for her dedicated and remarkable work.
I will be voting in favour of this text tomorrow, albeit with some reluctance.
We are in fact talking about the financing of our ambitions, which appear in the 2001 White Paper and are meant to stabilise transportâs modal shares or even to finance alternative modes of transport.
Those considerable ambitions were expressed in the 30 priority projects.
We now know, however, that the TEN budget will not be as much as the Commission is asking for to finance the large-scale projects.
We might have expected the âEurovignetteâ directive to be much more ambitious.
Unfortunately, it, too, is a subsidiary tool.
Member States who do not want to apply it will not be required to do so.
It is also a tool designed mainly to use road transport to finance road transport.
It would only finance other modes of transport occasionally.
I am very much afraid that, in order to reach a compromiseÂ âÂ and we should perhaps have used the conciliationÂ procedure âÂ the European Parliament will drop some of its ambitions tomorrow, that it will not be firm enough on external costs and in particular on the sunset clause that Mr El Khadraoui has tabled in an amendment.
That means that if the Commission and the Member States fail to propose a directive within the time required, the automatic clause will apply.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I am very much obliged to the rapporteur, who inherited this report, as it were, and has made quite outstanding progress with it in this parliamentary term.
I think that it is right that we have uniform rules at long last.
After all, the 21stÂ century should not go down in history as having robber barons still practising in Europe.
It is also important, however, that the money generated from the infrastructure flows back into the infrastructure and is not just used for plugging budgetary holes.
Allow me to say a few things about the external costs.
We also have to ask which costs are already internalised today and which are not.
Is it possible that there is an external benefit against which they must be offset?
The congestion costs have been internalised: they are paid by transport operators, because their lorries are not moving and thus cannot generate any gross national product.
The social costs have been internalised via insurance premiums: may I make that very clear.
In addition, as far as the environmental costs are concerned, we should not forget that every lorry and every car also pays vehicle and fuel tax.
It is unacceptable, therefore, for the transport sector to have to pay for everything, for funding, and on top of this for the money to flow into general budgets.
I am a little surprised by what MrÂ Cramer says.
I would recommend he take a look at the trend in the freight transport volume of Deutsche Bahn AG from SeptemberÂ 1998 to OctoberÂ 2005.
In the seven years in which his party shared power in the German Government, the volume of freight transport by rail fell by half.
His party also imposed the environmental tax on the railways.
I would advise him, therefore, not to give any speeches here about things for which, in essence, he is partly responsible.
That is unacceptable.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, for the work she has done and, above all, for the result that is on the table today.
A result that, if all goes well, will be the end, for the time being, of a long and laborious negotiation process.
It is provisional because a great deal of homework is yet to be done in terms of external costs, one of the key bottlenecks.
The Commission will need to develop a calculation method for the external costs within two years, upon which a fresh initiative will need to be taken.
Some will claim that compromise Amendment 37 does not go far enough.
Needless to say, I have a great deal of sympathy for this viewpoint, having myself tabled, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, an oral amendment that goes much further with a view to keeping the pressure on in order to make quicker progress in terms of external costs, the well-known 60% rule.
We scrapped this in the compromise, which means that things will all take a little longer.
This may be a concession, but this is offset by the fact that the Council, in its common position, had not made any reference to external costs, and had to make a U-turn without there being any turning back now.
The principle of external costs in toll charges will be accepted and applied.
This is surely considerable progress on the road to fairer competition between the modes of transport, with the underlying principle being that the polluter pays.
Combined with the fact that the revenue from toll charges will be used for investments in the whole of the transport system, and thus not only roads, means that possibilities are being created for alternative modes of transport, such as rail transport and inland shipping, which is a giant leap forward.
Â Â  Madam President, it is important not only for environmental reasons but also for reasons of competition to have a non-discriminatory kilometre tax system on European roads.
At the same time, it is important for the new Eurovignette to take account of the different conditions prevailing in Europe, for example in the peripheral Member States.
It is therefore good that this compromise first of all takes account of different geographical situations, secondly makes it possible to fix the price of infrastructure in ways that accurately reflect the cost to national economies and, thirdly, makes it possible to have different tolls for different euroclasses.
This is important in countries where long distances and light traffic mean that it is never possible to bring about a situation in which costs are fully covered.
I think, then, that the compromise is acceptable, since it takes account of countries in Europeâs outer circle.
Thank you, Madam President, and thank you everyone for your constructive work over a long period.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, first of all, I should like to express my deep respect to the rapporteur for her work on this truly difficult job.
The current status of discussions on the infrastructure costs directive is more or less satisfactory.
The most welcome results are primarily due to the pressure by Parliament and the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, within our institution, to the refreshing, committed approach of the rapporteur and also, in particular, my fellow Members towards the left and in the centre of this House.
In any case, the âEurovignette Directiveâ signifies a decision for the future, which we see as moving towards a more people-friendly and environmentally friendly transport policy, as indeed it must.
In this regard, it is of course essential that the Directive be usable â apart from the peculiar German derogations for lorries weighing 3.5Â tonnes or more mentioned by MrsÂ Lichtenberger â and that tolls be permitted not only on roads forming part of the trans-European transport network, but also on diversion and parallel routes.
In particular, however, the inclusion of external costs was much more important and indeed should have progressed faster.
This would have been a major step; one that we unfortunately failed to take.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool, for her excellent work.
This directive is of key significance for road hauliers.
This is firstly because we are taking a step that is little short of historic, by putting an end to the era of free roads in Europe.
Secondly, we are introducing charges that are in proportion to road usage.
Thirdly, the directive will mean extra costs for road hauliers.
At the same time, however, the directive is crucial as a source of funding for road construction.
This is vitally important for the new Member States, including my own country, Poland.
The directive is absolutely essential for the sustainable development of branched transport infrastructures.
I should like to remind CommissionerÂ Barrot, however, that we must carry out a systematic impact assessment for this directive.
This assessment should cover both the directiveâs impact on hauliers and on the road haulage market, and its impact in terms of furthering our goal of increasing the market share of railways.
Â Â  Madam President, I warmly congratulate Mrs Wortmann-Kool on her tenacity and flexibility, which are the greatest virtues in terms of achieving fair and balanced agreements such as the one that is being presented to us.
I would also like to congratulate the Council and the British Presidency on their dynamism and on the efforts they have made to achieve a good agreement.
We would like the same kind of results to be achieved in other fields as well.
It is also proper that I should congratulate the Commission and, if Commissioner Barrot will allow me, I would like in particular to congratulate the Director-General, Mr Lamoureux, who will be greatly missed and whose great contribution we wish to acknowledge.
The truth is that the impressive European achievements and progress in the field of transport now carry his mark.
We thank him in particular.
With regard to the Eurovignette, we welcome the political signal represented by breaking the taboo of external costs.
It is a small step, certainly, but it is essential to the future.
We are impatiently awaiting the Commissionâs study and we hope that it will be credible and acceptable to everybody, and also to the outlying countries, whose special circumstances and distances we hope will be taken into account.
Â Â  Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament as a whole for this rewarding debate, which has confirmed the broad support that the compromise negotiated between our three institutions enjoys today.
I would like to congratulate everyone, more especially your rapporteur, on this outcome, which represents undeniable progress, although I know that some of you would have liked to obtain even more.
This agreement is an important step forward and, thanks to Parliament, the next stages for the formal internalisation of external costs have been defined.
The Commission will have to model the best approach to this question, and then it will make an evaluation to analyse its impact.
It will do this over the next two years.
The Commission will use that analysis to make whatever proposals seem appropriate so that external costs can be borne internally.
This agreement is in keeping with our strategy for sustainable development while encouraging our economies to be competitive and guaranteeing the principle of equity: if the user pays, he must not pay twice.
Moreover, the sums raised will, so far as possible, have to be used for sustainable transport.
One of you spoke of a compromise, but it is a compromise that may be considered a commitment.
That is the word I will use.
For me as Commissioner, this compromise is a commitment for the future, a commitment to work for a mobility compatible with the demands of sustainable development.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0317/2005) by MrÂ R.Â Evans on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air (COM(2005)0047 â C6-0045/2005 â 2005/0007(COD)).
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, once this regulation is adopted, it will bring about a considerable improvement in conditions for our fellow citizens with disabilities or reduced mobility.
It aims to protect the rights of passengers when travelling by air and the major principle of our Community policy on non-discrimination against disabled people and those with reduced mobility.
I would like to thank the European Parliament, particularly your rapporteur, MrÂ Evans, who cooperated with the Council and the Commission to facilitate the speedy adoption of this proposal.
This is not the only initiative that aims to improve protection for people with reduced mobility in the transport sector: the Commission has made a commitment to look into the need to improve and guarantee these same rights in other modes of transport.
People with reduced mobility must be guaranteed appropriate assistance, regardless of where they are going, and regardless of what mode of transport they are using.
The Commission has already put forward a proposal for rail passengers and I intend to do the same for people with reduced mobility who use maritime transport and international coach transport.
I think, MrÂ Twigg, ladies and gentlemen, that in 2005 we really have made progress to the benefit of all people with reduced mobility, thus helping them to truly feel part of the European Union.
The proposal before you today meets this objective of non-discrimination.
It aims to set up ways of prohibiting operators from unreasonably refusing to transport people with reduced mobility by denying them the assistance they need.
In this proposal, to be presented on 16Â February, the Commission is pursuing four aims: there must be no discrimination against people with disabilities or reduced mobility; they must not be directly charged for the assistance they receive; this assistance must comply with a set of minimum standards and must be seamless; and responsibility for providing such assistance must be given to those best able to provide itÂ âÂ airports and airlines.
In order to achieve these aims, assistance on the ground, around and within airports, remains the responsibility of the airports, while the air carriers must be obliged to provide assistance on board aircraft.
Ladies and gentlemen, assistance for people with reduced mobility must not be watered down.
It must be organised by a single body responsible for ensuring that it is applied comprehensively, consistently and effectively.
In terms of concrete implementation, the proposal includes all the flexibility needed to design appropriate solutions for the airports and airlines.
As you know, the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council agreed on a general approach to this proposal in October.
Thanks to Parliamentâs constructive contribution, we hope that this important text can be adopted quickly, so as to provide disabled people and those with reduced mobility with the real possibility of assistance, throughout Europe.
That demonstrates the importance of this text in terms of society and solidarity.
I would like to thank you in advance, MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, for acting to ensure that we can give this advance as a giftÂ â if I may put it that way during this festive seasonÂ â to all disabled or elderly people and to everyone with reduced mobility, so that they can make use of all our modes of transport, just like able-bodied people.
Â Â  . Madam President, I congratulate the European Parliament for bringing this important proposal from the Commission to a speedy and successful conclusion.
This regulation, on the rights of disabled people and those with reduced mobility when travelling by air, will make a real improvement to the lives of those members of our Community, by giving them the security to take full advantage of the opportunities for air travel â for business and leisure â which have so transformed our world in recent years.
I particularly congratulate Mr Evans, the rapporteur, for his hard work and dedication in steering this dossier so fluently along its legislative path.
It is a fine example of how, when a legislative proposal offers real and tangible benefits to the citizens of the Community, the institutions can collaborate effectively to ensure that these benefits are delivered in the shortest possible time.
For the first time, this regulation sets out in clear terms what assistance disabled persons and those with reduced mobility are legally entitled to expect from airports and airlines and under what conditions.
By placing a clear responsibility on airport managing bodies to organise the necessary assistance for disabled passengers from the time they arrive at the airport until they board the plane, the regulation will give disabled persons travelling by air the assurance that their needs will be met seamlessly by one responsible body, backed by the force of European law.
Of course, many airports and airlines already provide excellent services to disabled people and are rightly proud of their achievements in this area.
The regulation recognises that fact by explicitly providing that airport managing bodies may, while retaining their overall legal responsibility, contract with other bodies, including airlines, to deliver services on the ground.
Thus, those airlines that already deliver a high level of service to disabled passengers should be able to secure contracts with the airport managing bodies to enable them to continue to do so.
In short, I consider that this regulation pulls off the difficult trick of ensuring that disabled people get the legal right to an acceptable standard of service when travelling by air, without placing undue and onerous burdens on the industry that has to provide these services.
I congratulate all concerned.
Â Â  . Madam President, I am very pleased to be able to present my report to Parliament tonight, the first major piece of disability legislation for air travellers.
I should like sincerely to thank the shadows, the Parliament and Group staff, my own staff, the Commission, the various disabled organisations and aviation groups with which I have been privileged to work and the UK Presidency, without whose sterling efforts my anticipated historic first reading agreement would not have been possible.
Too many people â the elderly or those with disabilities â complain of being neglected or, worse still, maltreated at Europeâs airports.
Fundamental rights for disabled passengers when travelling by air ought to be something we take for granted.
However, the reality can be very different.
One example is Ryanair and the insulting manner in which it treats disabled passengers.
It is probably the best-publicised culprit, but there are plenty of others and not just the low-cost carriers.
Madam President, you and I were speaking recently about your issues with Lufthansa; I have had other issues with Iberia, to name but two.
Only yesterday, on my flight to Strasbourg, Air France blamed the one disabled passenger for the one-hour delay in boarding people.
Of course, against this, as Mr Twigg has said, many peopleâs experiences are positive, and many airlines and airports offer a good service.
However, it was against a background of complaints and a service which can at best be described as patchy that, earlier this year, as the Commissioner said, his Commission presented proposals for improving the rights of persons of reduced mobility, to which, despite some opposition early on, I am very pleased we have now been able to add disabled people.
During its passage through the European Parliament I have also been pleased to be able to present other improvements.
Most importantly, ensuring that the proposal is for a seamless service for passengers, from any point of arrival at any of the airports in the European Union, to destinations â including transfers, which are often the most traumatic experiences for people.
At my suggestion, the committee also amended the Commission text to give airports the overall responsibility for ensuring an efficient and effective service with, as Mr Twigg again mentioned, the ability to contract it out if they so wish.
I am also very pleased to be able to amend the proposal to allow guide dogs or service dogs on long-haul flights, because I am advised that the owners of those dogs are in the best position to judge how long a flight the animal can cope with.
In the report we also requested that planes and airports be better designed in consultation with disabled peopleâs organisations and that the airport and airline staff be given real disability awareness training.
In addition, I think there is a real need for reservation systems, including websites, to be much more user-friendly and effective.
The aim is to ensure that people with reduced mobility and disabled passengers enjoy the same rights when travelling by air as you or I, without incurring any additional costs â the costs being spread across every passenger handled by the air carrier and included in the price of the ticket.
Airline statistics suggest that up to ten million passengers in this category are assisted at Europeâs airports every year.
Therefore, it is essential that the guidelines are clear and agreed at European level.
It would be pointless if one or a few of the 25Â EU Member States had good legislation and the others had poor legislation or none at all.
Travelling by air is now almost as common as travelling by car, with up to half the population expecting to fly at least once a year.
Without this sort of watertight legislation, some airlines will look for loopholes to avoid providing for disabled people and those who need a little extra help at busy airports where the distance from check-in to the boarding gate can be up to a kilometre.
Many airlines have made improvements under a voluntary agreement.
However, without proper legislation, there will always be some who, by negligence or indifference, ruin the holidays or trips of vulnerable people.
I hope colleagues will support this proposal, because it is long overdue.
It is much anticipated and, above all, it is a good news and positive European story.
I repeat my thanks for the incredible endeavour of the UK Presidency, because I know the vast amount of time and effort that has been put into it.
I thank the President-in-Office warmly for his presence here tonight at nearly 10.10 p.m.
All 25Â EU governments and all the major parties in the European Parliament are in support of this package that will be presented.
We should be very proud when we vote on this report on Thursday and achieve, as I hope and expect, an agreement at first reading.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have recently seen the latest in a long series of examples of discrimination against a disabled passenger by a low-cost airline.
This is a situation which, regrettably, is recurring with worrying regularity and which requires this regulation to be approved urgently.
Thanks to the hard work of the rapporteur, Mr Evans, and to cooperation by the Council and Commission, we have achieved a good compromise which will allow us to approve the regulation at first reading and to have it implemented rapidly.
This is an important regulation for disabled and elderly passengers as it guarantees a series of fundamental rights.
Firstly, it enshrines the right to assistance free of charge and prohibits any refusal to allow passengers with reduced mobility to embark.
It will put an end to abuse and discrimination.
Secondly, it identifies the airport operator as the single point of reference with general service responsibility to which passengers can turn, and will also enable those airlines which have hitherto provided high-quality assistance to continue to do so, on condition that they comply with the standards set out in the regulation.
Rules are set for providing uniform assistance for all, irrespective of the size of the airport.
Assistance must be guaranteed from the point of arrival outside the airport, not only from the check-in desk as is the case today.
Compensation will be payable in the event of loss or damage to wheelchairs and other equipment, and there is provision for mandatory training for staff providing assistance.
Information must be available in a form accessible to all and the protection of privacy will be assured.
These are fundamental guarantees to protect the right to mobility without discrimination, and it is therefore an important step forward in the defence of human rights, of which the European Parliament is the guarantor.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if a regulation is concluded at first reading, the rapporteur deserves double the praise, especially if it was not a very easy one.
The unacceptable practice of some airlines of refusing carriage, on cost grounds, to people with disabilities will be impossible in future.
There will be comprehensive, uniform rules at European level for the rights of air passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility; which represents great progress.
This is a further step towards the passenger rights for all modes of transport that are so important to us.
It will also enable us to take due account of demographic development in our countries and of the increasing mobility of the European public.
In future, airport operators will bear clear responsibility for the services to be organised.
Some airlines have already put such services in place themselves, and any solutions of theirs that function well will continue to be possible, by agreement and subject to contractual rules.
Â Â  . â The proposal tabled by the European Commission on the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air was timely, and I, as a shadow speaker for the Liberal and Democratic Alliance for the Europe Group of the European Parliament, agree in principal that the rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air should be regulated on the European Union level.
It is no secret that disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility are discriminated against in respect of other passengers, not only whilst booking flight tickets but also when boarding planes.
Therefore, I believe that implementation of the new directive will prevent such discrimination.
I also believe that by approving this report we will ensure equal travel possibilities for disabled persons and those with reduced mobility and will regulate the provision of such services at the European Union level.
Persons with reduced mobility will no longer be groundlessly refused to book a flight or board a plane.
Furthermore, specially trained personnel will provide such persons with assistance tailored to their personal needs, and, most importantly, such services will be provided free of charge; the responsibility will lie with a single institution which will ensure that such services are provided continuously and to a high standard.
I congratulate Mr Evans and I thank him for the possibility of constructive cooperation.
I believe that the compromises achieved will contribute to passing the legal acts at first reading.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficulties faced by disabled persons â those with a sensory or physical incapacity â on flights could have filled whole books.
We knew of and were familiar with these difficulties.
In fact, it is a sad reflection of a society that it has to pass its own directive to clear the obstacles to the journeys of people who are disadvantaged enough in their lives as it is.
I should like to thank my colleague MrÂ Evans.
He has done a tremendous job, and we enjoyed a marvellous working relationship.
I should also like to thank the organisations representing disabled persons, which stood by our side and gave us good tips.
In addition, I wish to ask the Member States to drive the implementation and entry into force of this directive forward as quickly as possible at airports, in particular, and make it a real Christmas present.
Â Â  â Madam President, the Committee on Transport and Tourism succeeded in reaching a compromise on the issue under discussion, which was made abundantly clear in Amendment 49.
Disabled people and people with reduced mobility have the same rights as the rest of the community to freedom of movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination.
These rights extend to all areas of peopleâs lives and air transport is no exception.
All subsequent content stems from this positive principle and we welcome this, not least the extension of the original plans to cover not only those with limited mobility but also people with physical or mental disabilities, something that deserves to be highlighted.
This extended concept could be more stringent for operators or lead to further costs, but the problem is not the peopleâs problem, and must not be seen as such, but should be viewed as part of a broader need to ensure accessibility to infrastructure, transport and services, for which fair solutions must be found.
Ladies and gentlemen, one does not remove barriers by creating other barriers.
We must therefore congratulate the rapporteur on his ability to broker compromises in adopting amendments, for example those relating to the distribution of responsibilities between airports and airlines.
The report acknowledges that there are airlines already offering this service to a very high standard, an aspect that often sets them apart from their competitors, and at no extra cost.
Madam President, I have two more brief remarks.
I wish firstly to highlight the attention to detail in the drafting of the proposal; the changes made to the Regulation certainly make it more difficult to practise discrimination.
Secondly, I would like to praise the explicit introduction of the principle of transparency in the calculation of attendance rates charged by airports to the airlines, which will ensure proportionality and direct correlation with the actual service provided.
To conclude, I welcome this report and congratulate Mr Evans and those who helped him to reach the excellent compromise.
Â Â  Madam President, I believe that disabled people with reduced mobility in the European Union â this being something that we will all experience sooner or later â have been extremely lucky to have a Labour rapporteur, Robert Evans, and a British Presidency of the Council which, in a laborious â not to say labour â fashion, have been able to invite them on board without discrimination and with guaranteed facilities.
In close cooperation with the Commission, which, we must acknowledge, is doing exemplary work in terms of facilitating access for disabled people to all forms of transport â they have already done so in the case of trains, now aircraft, and tomorrow buses â have succeeded in drawing up rigorous legislation, which is demanding but applicable, and suited to the new circumstances of the airports and companies.
To put an end to all kinds of discrimination and to propose legislation that shows solidarity will move us further in the direction of a more social, accessible and democratic Europe.
We in the European Parliament recently received a group of visitors made up of blind and disabled people, belonging to ONCE, the largest Spanish organisation in this field, which acknowledged not just that their opinions had made an active contribution, but that this experience had convinced them that the European Parliament and the European Union are working seriously for the citizens.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this legislation, we are most clearly deciding on the rights of more than 50Â million Europeans with particular needs when travelling by air.
We may even be deciding on our own lives, as anyone could be affected â whether it be as a result of an accident or of illness.
In fact, we shall probably all be affected; that is to say, as a result of old age.
After all, we all want to live to old age.
We do not want to be old, however, and certainly not to do without mobility.
I am confident that we shall succeed in pushing through equal opportunities and non-discrimination for travel, too.
We are starting today with air transport, and tomorrow we shall be discussing similar aspects in rail, bus and waterborne transport.
I am proud of the European Union for creating â in the shape of this regulation â the first legislation especially for people with disabilities.
The proposal provides that an air carrier or tour operator may not refuse to accept a reservation for a flight on the grounds of reduced mobility of the passenger.
It does, however, permit certain exceptions.
For example, the reservation can be refused if the size of the aircraft or the absence of cabin crew do not permit the carriage of persons with reduced mobility.
In that case, however, the person concerned must be offered alternatives.
The second key point in the proposal after the carriage obligation consists in the establishment of the quality and quantity of high-level assistance.
In future, this will also â but not exclusively â be available from the airlines operating out of EU airports.
It is good that there is a consensus that the cost of particular services for air passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility must be shared equally by all air passengers.
I would ask my fellow Members to support the Evans report tomorrow.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, MrÂ Twigg, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank MrÂ Evans once again for his excellent work and I would also like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
The amendments proposed enhance the Commissionâs objectives.
They enable us to put the emphasis firmly on the need to prevent any discrimination against people with reduced mobility and on the need to assist them when they travel by air, throughout Europe.
These amendments serve to clarify the text by reaching a compromise that is positive for everyone, and I would also like, MrÂ Twigg, to thank the Council for having enabled us to reach an agreement at first reading.
The Commission accepts all of the amendments in this compromise.
It also adds a statement, enabling it to confirm its commitment to look into the possibility of extending the rights of passengers with reduced mobility to compensation if their wheelchairs, the equipment enabling them to be mobile, is damaged, destroyed or lost when being transported.
I would like to thank Parliament one last time for its support and I must say that the text you are going to adopt will have a practical impact on more than 40Â million people with reduced mobility in Europe, a figure taken from the communication that CommissionerÂ Å pidla has just published.
That is all I have to say, MadamÂ President, and I would add that it is now up to the Commission and to the Commissioner responsible for transport to ensure that this text is properly implemented.
I do indeed commit to doing so following the excellent work done by Parliament and the Council.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0378/2005) by MrÂ Kristensen on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the promotion and protection of consumersâ interests in the new Member States (2004/2157(INI)).
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I was very pleased to be rapporteur for this report.
Consumer protection and consumer policy in general are important issues, and I am also pleased that the European Parliament is involved in putting them high on the political agenda.
A large proportion of the work that goes on in the EU at the moment is of course about getting the internal market to operate more smoothly when it comes to both goods and services.
It is ultimately for consumers that companies produce goods and services, so it is quite crucial to competition in the internal market that consumers make demands of such goods and services.
In order for them to do so, it is essential, firstly, that consumers know what demands they can make of companies and that they be used to being percipient and critical when they shop.
Secondly, it is important for consumers to have the right channels available to them for making these demands.
In this connection, it is crucial that we turn our attention to the new Member States.
Just as there are big differences from one old Member State to another, we cannot, of course, lump the ten new Member States together.
There is, however, no doubt that what might be called consumer culture tends generally to be weaker in many of the new Member States than in many of the old ones.
Consumers are often not especially demanding with regard to the quality of the products and services they buy, and institutionalised procedures for complaining about defects in, or problems with, products or services either do not exist or exist to only a limited degree.
If we are to change this situation, it is essential that we try to strengthen consumer culture.
There are several places where intervention is possible.
I believe that one of the most important things to do is to direct our attention to the consumer organisations.
In many of the old Member States, independent consumer organisations play a central role in placing consumer issues on the political agenda and in helping and representing consumers in disputes with businesses.
The consumer organisations are, unfortunately, often very weak in the new Member States, and they therefore rarely constitute the necessary counterbalance to businesses and governments.
One major problem in this context is the consumer organisationsâ lack of financial resources.
Only in a few countries does the ministry responsible make resources available and, in those cases in which financial resources do exist, the amounts are often very small.
Over and above government funding, another possibility is EU funding for projects through the Commission.
The conditions for winning a tender or obtaining support from the Commission are, however, very strict and, at least in a number of cases, it is difficult for the consumer organisations to meet the Commissionâs requirements.
A second problem is that the political influence of consumer organisations is often quite limited.
This can be explained in a number of ways.
Firstly, many organisations have difficulty securing enough support from the public, due both to their weak economic situation and to the publicâs relatively low awareness of consumer issues.
Secondly, there are often not very many formal channels through which the NGOs can influence the political decision-making process.
Moreover, there are great differences as to how consumer organisations in the new Member States are structured.
Often, there exist many small consumer organisations, competing against each other instead of pulling together.
It is very difficult for the organisations to convey their views with sufficient force in the decision-making process and, thus, in the public debate.
Moreover, there is the problem that most consumer organisation employees work as volunteers.
Undoubtedly, they are enthusiastic, but they are difficult to hold onto in the long term.
These are problems that we must sort out if the internal market and consumer protection are to operate at their best.
Responsibility for solving these problems is not located unambiguously in the one place.
The governments of the new Member States have a responsibility for taking consumer issues far more seriously than they do at present and, at the same time, for providing the necessary support to consumer organisations.
It should be understood, however, that a high level of consumer protection and an efficient market economy are not mutually exclusive but are, on the contrary, dependent on one another.
At the same time, the Commission and the other EU Member States have an outright political responsibility for giving priority to these issues, especially in the new Member States.
It is a responsibility for taking the lead and ensuring that consumers become more aware of their rights and role as consumers in the internal market.
Last but not least, the consumer organisations in the new Member States also have a responsibility themselves.
I would therefore hope that we might have a constructive debate on the report.
I think that we have a good opportunity for strengthening the consumer organisations in the new Member States.
Â Â  . Madam President, I shall try to be as brief as possible.
Usually I am the last on the list in these late debates, so I know exactly what we are talking about!
I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating MrÂ Kristensen and Parliament for this initiative.
It is very important to identify the special situation regarding new Member States and consumer protection.
Even though a lot has been done already, and I will talk about that later, a lot still needs to be done.
We have come a long way, but extra effort is still needed.
I know that some of you have already heard me speaking to the Intergroup, but I shall echo what I said here with one word: how?
How are we going to do all the things you are suggesting?
Most of them I agree with, and we are going to try and see how we can adopt in practical terms, but the problem is that to do all those things we will need adequate funds, and that is a problem.
It is true we have reached a very high level of legislation.
This is a fact.
But there will always be room for improvement.
As you know, we have the review of the very soon, but at the same time we have reached the point where we need to enforce, to implement.
This is usually done through training, education, capacity-building â largely through consumer organisations.
This is even truer for new Member States.
The question is how this is to be done without sufficient funds.
We have a more demanding situation now.
We now have 25Â Member States, soon to be 27, and not 15Â Member States.
Yet at the same time, in practice, we will have fewer funds than we had for the EU-15.
Based on last weekâs latest proposal on the budget, if we fund the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Control, as envisaged in the programme, there will be no money left for anything else.
New Member States or old Member States, new initiatives or old initiatives, we will not have any funds left.
Therefore, we will have to re-evaluate our priorities and limit the areas in which we are going to work to make sure that we make an impact with the limited funds we will have.
It is true that we have a lot to do in the new Member States, but we have gone a long way.
There are very interesting suggestions in the report.
We will try to find the best ways to apply them.
However, I can tell you that we have already achieved a lot: we offer training courses especially for consumer organisation staff in new Member States.
More than 60% of the trainees come from new Member States. We give priority to calls for specific projects.
EU co-financing is higher and the criteria are more favourable for the new Member States.
We have already had information campaigns in Poland this year and will have them in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia next year.
With regard to European consumer centres, which are very important institutions â you have supported the idea many times â we already have them in seven out of the ten new Member States and next year will be establishing them in Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia.
We will continue in the meantime to work on finding the means to make operational some of the calls in Mr Kristensenâs report.
To do our job properly, we will need to have the right data and information.
We will need to have objective criteria to be able to evaluate and assess the situation in each Member State and, in particular, in the new Member States.
Finally, I have to say that we have limits: not just financial limits, but also competence limits.
What we do complements but does not substitute for national responsibility and national initiatives.
Many aspects, such as the financing of the day-to-day operations of national consumer organisations, are the responsibility of national governments.
That is the main reason why I always emphasise in my meetings with the ministers responsible for consumer protection that consumer policy has to become a priority.
I believe that Members of the European Parliament can also play a very important role in this respect.
I shall conclude by making two points.
Firstly, I can assure you that in the consumer strategy we will bring forward in 2006 there will be a more detailed, elaborate proposal that we will develop and present to Parliament.
It will give a greater focus on new Member States, taking into account as many of the suggestions in the report as possible.
I should like to announce to the House something that you may find interesting.
We have circulated a questionnaire.
We are building a country profile for all Member States in the consumer protection area, containing all the data on the situation, and this will be published on the website.
This will make it more transparent, so that both consumer organisations, Members of Parliament and anybody interested will be able to see.
If there is anything incorrect, I would be very happy to know, because most of the information will be given to us by the Member States.
But at least it will be the first step towards being able to compare the situation between the various Member States.
I will stop there.
I apologise if I have spoken for too long.
I will now listen with great interest to the debate.
Â Â  Commissioner, you do not have to apologise.
You were very precise and it was very interesting.
I can assure you that Mr Barrot spoke for much longer!
Â Â  . â Commissioner, I found your words most encouraging, and I would merely like to stress the importance of this report in terms of raising confidence in the internal market.
Consumer protection and the internal market are intrinsically linked.
According to the analysis carried out by my colleagues in the CPP, the new Member States came under pressure during the accession negotiations to make their consumer protection laws more modern and in some areas more stringent than those of the old, and in particular the founding Member States.
It also came through in our discussions in committee that politicians on both sides were unaware of this.
It is clear to all, however, that the crucial difference lies in the level of consumer culture between old and new Member States.
The citizens as customers are unaware of their rights and do not assert themselves sufficiently in this regard.
Given that over the past 40 or 50 years they have not been used to fighting for their rights, the provision of information about such rights and assistance in claiming them, both in and out of court, are the key elements of the implementation of consumer protection, as the Kristensen report emphasises.
Consequently, citizens in the new Member States are also easy prey to unscrupulous business practices, even from the old Member States, in which such practices are not permitted and where there is in fact a more highly developed consumer culture, for example the restriction of users' rights in the case of goods covered by intellectual property protection, attempts to distribute untested goods from non-EU countries, and so on. In the report, we urge the Commission to establish measurable quality indicators for the purpose of benchmarking, because we feel that in order to ensure high quality it is extremely important â and this is not only true of the new Member States â to establish publicly objective standards.
I would also like to highlight the fact that consumer organisations differ from those in the old Member States and that there is a need to enable them to allow for the work of volunteers ...
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank MrÂ Kristensen for his outstanding report, which really does address exactly the right issues.
He has shown a great deal of creativity in drafting this report, which provides us with many excellent starting points, as MrÂ Kyprianou has just confirmed.
In my opinion, it is crucial that a high â and indeed an equally high â level of consumer protection be achieved in all EU Member States.
This is the goal we must set ourselves, and this is why the idea of a consumer culture is exactly the right place to start in order to demonstrate the need for us to ensure a high level of awareness of consumer rights in all Member States, in order for citizens to be able to demand these rights, which is a prerequisite for achieving this high level of protection in reality.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, our group very much welcomes this own-initiative report, which is of great value.
It will allow Parliament to send an important political message to the Commission, as well as to the Member States, to industry and to the public.
Consumer protection organisations and consumer rights belong to the European Unionâs key fundamental values.
I am delighted that the fruits of many years of work in the 15Â old Member States, which are now taken for granted in these countries, are also to be reaped by the 10Â new Member States, in line with the principles of partnership and solidarity.
At the same time, however, the old Member States could learn a lot from the new Member States in this field.
I would also call on the old Member States to ensure that consumer protection continues to be given its due priority.
Budgetary cuts, such as those planned in Thuringia, for example, send out the wrong message.
We should be doing exactly the opposite, and ensuring that the voice of consumers is heard more clearly during our decision-making processes.
Â Â  . Madam President, this report foreshadows the recruitment and subsidy of selected consumer agencies with a view to promoting the EUâs consumer product legislation and preparing consumers for the adoption of the euro.
In other words, the EU institutions are planning to use taxpayersâ money to hire advocates of their own policies.
This is nothing but a propaganda exercise of the worst kind because in this way, the state becomes both judge and plaintiff, and independent thought or opposition becomes an underground activity.
Is there no substantial understanding of the dangers of this among the Members who sit here now, or in Parliament as a whole?
Are they so utterly blind to all but the cosy platitudes of the EUâs carefully engineered, hugely bribed sectoral lobbies?
Mr Kristensenâs contribution is scarcely more than a tiny pebble in a landslide of such similar instruments, but it illustrates well enough what is going on.
One day Members who now gape at me uncomprehendingly will experience the icy chill up the spine that I experienced today, and the sooner the better.
I have said on many other occasions that if the EU was the answer, it must have been a silly question.
We can now also see how very dangerous it is.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for his excellent report, which is first and foremost a key political message to the European Commission, to the governments of the Member States, to the business world and to consumers.
We must not forget the specific conditions in the new Member States when formulating European consumer policy.
The report contains comprehensive descriptions of the situation and standing of consumer organisations in these countries.
Their consumer organisations are only just starting to gain a foothold in the internal market, and they are plagued by a constant lack of money and expertise.
It is therefore crucially important for the various groups and institutions providing funding and training, with the aim of ensuring that strong and independent consumer organisations can be set up, to join forces.
At the same time, we should not forget that consumer organisations in many new Member States are financially dependent on the state, which means that we can hardly expect them to be independent.
It is for this reason that the proposal to simplify EU funding and to make it more flexible is entirely justified.
In addition to funding, further important fields of action include the training of staff, the establishment of umbrella organisations and the setting up of twinning projects and other projects, such as those involving the provision of advice.
Measures of this nature will help to strengthen consumer organisations, and consequently to raise public awareness and to promote a consumer culture.
I should like to conclude with one last comment to the House, regarding the provision of information to consumer organisations and the maintenance of contacts with these latter.
As a new Member of the House, and as a member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I have to admit that I am only just starting to make contact with consumer organisations in my own country and work with them.
These organisations often have no access to up-to-date information or to the Internet, which makes it a great deal more difficult for us to keep in touch.
I therefore believe that it would be a very good idea to publish monthly magazines targeted at the new Member States and containing analyses of current EU consumer policy.
This is in fact one of the proposals made by the rapporteur in his report.
Â Â  I too welcome the report of Mr Dam Kristensen, and I recommended that the report be translated and sent to all members of national Parliaments in the new Member States, because it indicates that considerable assistance can be given to new Member States even without money.
This report could be an action plan standard for new Member States.
At the same time, I obviously agree with Commissioner Kyprianou that the resources available to us are not sufficient, and I am deeply convinced that our most important task is to include consumer protection issues in the compulsory curriculum for very young children (I also say this as the mother of three children).
Therefore I congratulate Mr Kristensen and ask the Commissioner to treat the issue of consumer protection as part of the development process of the internal market in new Member States, as the internal market cannot operate in a balanced manner if consumers in Scandinavian and Eastern European countries cannot exercise their rights to the same extent.
Â Â  This report is historically the first to deal with consumer protection in the new Member States.
As a Member representing Slovakia, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a fine and consistent report, and also for his cooperation.
With reference to the report, I would like to mention the satisfactory results achieved by the new Member States in transposing and effectively applying Community legislation in practice.
A good example of this would be the swift implementation of a directive dealing with certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and related guarantees.
On the basis of this directive, sellers in the new Member States provide consumers with a minimum two-year guarantee for the goods sold since accession to the European Union.
To my surprise, sellers in Belgium and France, for instance, provide no such guarantee, and consumers are not informed of their rights.
The reason for this situation is a lengthy delay in the implementation of this directive in certain EU-15 countries.
Some of them have implemented it only after a ruling from the European Court of Justice, and awareness of it is still poor among sellers and consumers.
The key point of this report is its emphasis on the financing of consumer organisations.
Despite lack of funding, consumer organisations in the new Member States make considerable efforts, mainly through volunteers, to improve consumer culture.
They contribute greatly to the education of young people in schools and encourage them to form good consumer habits.
For instance, the Consumer Diary is an excellent activity that is helping young Europeans understand their consumer rights and obligations.
I am convinced that only professional organisations of a high standard focusing on the protection of consumer rights and supported by sufficient funding will be able to bring about the development of a European consumer culture without borders.
Â Â  . Madam President, in the strategy for 2006 we will have special initiatives for the new Member States, taking the report into account.
It is a basic policy that consumer protection is an integral part of the internal market and we cannot have completion of the internal market without consumer confidence and consumer protection.
Therefore, I emphasise to those Member States that usually need more encouragement that this is also an investment, not just a human rights obligation that we owe to our citizens.
We also make an investment in the growth of the economy by investing in consumer protection.
The situation in the consumer organisation area is problematic in many new Member States.
Some Member States have too many organisations â about 100 â while others have too few.
Therefore, without interfering with the right of assembly or with private rights, we need to encourage stronger organisations, maybe federations, but this is something on which we can only advise; we cannot enforce it.
That applies to financing too.
The responsibility for most of the financing of the operational costs of the consumer organisations lies with the national governments.
We can encourage, we can suggest, we can try to convince, but it has to be decided by the national governments.
The European Consumer Centres, which play a great role, can carry out that function.
I am happy that, by next year, all the new Member States will have their own European Consumer Centres.
I agree that the issue of volunteer work is very important for the consumer organisations.
In our calculations, when we award projects, we take volunteer work into consideration as part of the contribution in kind.
In that way, we help the organisations cover their part of the contribution to their financing through this volunteer work, which is a great help to the consumer organisations.
On training, we can train the trainers.
We can train the permanent staff of organisations who have to train the volunteers.
As regards logistical â and especially language â problems, we do not have enough specialised people who can train in all the languages.
So we train the consumer organisation staff who then can train volunteer workers.
I agree with Mr Kristensenâs suggestion that we have to remind ourselves that the new Member States have no derogation on joining the eurozone and adopting the euro.
If this is an obligation for new Member States, we might as well work with them and their citizens so that they can properly prepare, and in a timely fashion, for the adoption of the euro.
With regard to education, I agree.
We have the Consumer Diary, as you know, which is distributed in schools. It was very well received.
I have figures from the new Member States.
Of course, there is still room for improvement next year.
I encouraged the Ministers for Education to increase the number of diaries that will be distributed to schools and students.
Hopefully, we will soon be introducing the concept of a Masters Degree in consumer protection, which will be an incentive for young people to study this specialised area.
Once again, I congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for this interesting debate.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0281/2005) by MrÂ Lehideux, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime (COM(2005)0266 â C6-0210/2005 â 2005/0117(COD)).
Â Â  . Madam President, on 24Â November the Council reached a political compromise on the reform of the EU sugar regime.
From the beginning of the reform debate, the Commission has been well aware that any reform leading to a more market-oriented sugar regime will require the Sugar Protocol ACP countries to adjust.
The Commission is committed to helping those countries through this adjustment phase and has therefore proposed accompanying measures.
Before drafting the proposal for a regulation on accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries, the Commission had produced an action plan setting out the principles of its proposed support for the Sugar Protocol countries.
Discussions have taken place with the ACP countries concerned and this assistance scheme is designed to respond as closely as possible to the needs identified by the countries themselves.
It recognises the diversity of impacts between countries and offers support both to the sugar sector and to strengthening alternative economic activities.
Social and environmental mitigation measures are also included.
I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Lehideux, on his commitment and very constructive engagement in support of the Protocol countries.
The Commission welcomes the amendments proposed in his report.
The Commission understands the complexity of the challenges facing the ACP countries concerned.
The Commission has proposed EURÂ 40Â million for initial investment in 2006, taking into account the Communityâs budget availability and the lack of information on the precise needs, which are estimated at this stage.
Substantial additional funding will be provided from 2007 onwards.
The reform of the EU sugar regime will only start being implemented from July 2006 onwards.
However, it is important to start supporting the countries concerned from next year onwards, before the maximum impacts of the sugar reform are felt.
Anticipating these effects and starting to adapt to the expected changes as early as possible is likely to be the most successful coping strategy.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has links with the 18 ACP countries via some very old agreements on sugar.
It would obviously be inconceivable to sever these close links brutally under the pretext of reforming our sugar regime, however necessary it may be.
Reform of the CMO in sugar will, of course, have extremely serious economic and financial consequences in countries that have, until now, been able to export to the EU markets.
However, its effects will also go far beyond that.
For most of these countries, sugar is not just a product like any other.
The reform will have an extremely serious social impact in these countries, due to the very special role played by sugar cane cultivation: a social, economic, cultural and environmental role.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is an urgent matter and it is out of the question to wait for the 2007-2013 financial perspective before acting.
It is therefore our duty, as you just said, Commissioner, to take measures now that will be applicable from 2006 and may be renewed in 2007 to assist the initial efforts of these countries to restructure their sugar industries or to diversify their economies.
Commissioner, now is certainly not the time for Parliament to make pronouncements on the definitive measures that should be put in place, but allow me to formally request that the measures put to the ACP countries be up to the challenge.
In view of conversations I have had with the Council and with the Commission while drafting this report, I can assure you that this request is not simply a rhetorical one.
I would just like to backtrack briefly, if I may.
Parliamentâs Committee on Development unanimously called for the aid provided by the Commission forÂ 2006, which it considered to be completely inadequate, to be doubled from EURÂ 40 to 80Â million.
I bitterly regret the attitude of certain Member States who did everything they could to block this proposal, particularly by refusing to take part in any dialogue on any increase of the 40Â million proposed.
They would not allow this amount to move by a single euro, and some of them even talked about reducing it.
I also find the Commissionâs attitude regrettable, as it turned a deaf ear to the incessant and unanimous calls from the ACP countries for a larger sum.
The Commissionâs refusal to re-examine this figure, which is obviously far too low, meant that the Council would have to take a unanimous decision to increase the proposed amount, which was pretty much mission impossible, despite the efforts of the UK Presidency, I would emphasise.
Unfortunately, I can only regret having been defeated in this very place, during the budgetary discussions.
One day, this Parliament will have to take a look at the unacceptable way in which the Committee on Budgets deals with the political priorities issued by the other thematic committees.
I really cannot understand how a figure of 80Â million proposed by all the members of the Committee on Development can just be dismissed out of hand by the members of the Committee on Budgets.
Be that as it may, we were obliged to accept this arrangement hatched without us.
Indeed, in order for this regulation to be implemented normally, and in view of the timescale for examining the action plans to be submitted by the ACP countries, it is vital for it to be adopted at first reading.
This situation therefore caught us in an impasse: if we took the risk of pushing through a sum of 80Â million, that would have lead to a second reading, which would have threatened the very existence of the text.
True, as I said before, the level of aid is clearly inadequate, but these countries need this money now and cannot be made to wait under the pretext that the Council, the Commission and a number of our fellow Members are not prepared to keep the European Unionâs commitments or its word.
MadamÂ President, one time does not make a habit.
This attitude is, in my view, a very short-term one.
At a time when the EU is taking part in the difficult negotiations at the WTO, tomorrow in Hong Kong, the day after elsewhere, I am afraid that the ACP countries risk remembering how flippantly we have treated them.
In conclusion, Commissioner, once this regulation has been adopted, the development of this matter will be in the hands of the European Commission and will ultimately depend largely on the welcome it gives to the projects of the ACP countries.
I hope that Parliament will be kept regularly informed, via its Committee on Development, which I would like to thank for its constant support, on developments in this important matter.
Â Â  .Â Â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to extend my wholehearted thanks to MrÂ Lehideux for his report.
Unfortunately, it was all we could manage in the circumstances.
By this I mean that we have had to face facts, and to accept that only EURÂ 40Â million will be available to the 18Â Sugar Protocol countries as compensation in 2006.
Although this compensation will at least be approved at first reading, which we can only hope will mean that it will be paid out in good time, we are all aware that it is nowhere near enough.
Our own sugar farmers, on the other hand, will receive extremely generous compensation, to the tune of over EURÂ 5Â billion.
Hundreds of millions more were added at the last minute in order to reach an agreement, with money apparently no object.
While I do not begrudge our sugar farmers this compensation in the slightest, I would be willing to bet that our policies will directly contribute to the future political and social destabilisation of some of the ACP countries, most of which are small island states.
These countries are prepared to carry out reforms, to diversify and to modernise, but they will struggle to cope if the total subsidies they receive are cut by 36% in four yearsâ time.
I myself have visited Guyana and various other countries.
Nearly two thirds of jobs in Guyana depend directly or indirectly on sugar.
It would be impossible for anyone to deal with cuts of this magnitude in only four years, and so noÂ one should be surprised if the country becomes politically or socially unstable.
Such instability would be a direct result of our policy-making in this Chamber.
I ask for my words to be taken down, so that noÂ one can claim to be surprised when the inevitable happens.
Only 10% of jobs in Jamaica depend on sugar, but the crime rate there is already incredibly high, with 1Â 400Â murders having been committed this year alone in a country that numbers twoÂ million inhabitants.
If this figure were extrapolated to Germany, it would mean over 50Â 000Â murders, whereas the actual number is only around 300.
This is a good indication of the social situation in the country, and if we cause the unemployment rate to rise by a further 10%, then it should come as no surprise if Jamaica, too, becomes unstable.
Â Â  .
Madam President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that we are getting near Christmas and it is a time for giving and generosity, but I think she is getting the message here that EURÂ 40Â million is not very generous at all.
If my group supports the report tomorrow it will be with a heavy heart, as the rapporteur has said, because we feel that the EURÂ 80Â million that the Committee on Development voted unanimously for was the minimum.
Now we are going to halve that and put only EURÂ 40Â million on the table.
We are doing this to get a first reading deal and to ensure rapid disbursement.
It is a paltry sum and even more paltry when compared with the EURÂ 7Â billion we managed to find to support our own producers and companies affected by sugar reform.
Perhaps I would not mind so much if I really believed that the money would go to small farmers, but I am not sure that it will. Looking at evidence from the past, I do not believe it will.
In the last two years Tate [amp] Lyle sugar has had GBPÂ 227Â million from the CAP budget.
NestlÃ©, in the UK alone, has had GBPÂ 11Â million, and even more in Belgium and Holland.
I understand that KLM has had money because it put some runways on some former farming land.
We need a lot more transparency about where the CAP funds go.
French farmers at the moment are getting just 10% of the CAP subsidies.
In Spain 18% of the top farmers received 76% of the funding in 2003.
We must get away from the idea that it is our farmers versus the farmers in the developing world.
As far as I can see, the little people everywhere are not getting very much at all from the CAP at the moment.
To return to the EURÂ 40Â million, it can only be the beginning.
I realise this is not your dossier, Commissioner, but I believe you said that there will be substantially more support in the future.
If we are going to make poverty history we really must do much more than that in the future.
Many of the 18Â protocol countries are not the poorest countries in the world, but they are not the richest either.
In fact, they are pretty poor and many of them have just taken the first step on the way to development.
I do not think this is the time to pull the rug from under their feet.
They need time to adjust to sugar reform and they need money.
When we talk about money we should talk about new money from the EU budget.
Let us not talk about taking some money off the development budget to give it to the sugar protocol countries; let us not rob the very poorest to give to the slightly less poor.
The Commission President has talked a lot about Robin Hood in the last couple of weeks.
Let us not play Robin Hood in reverse.
Let us find new money to aid these countries.
Let us remember that we have sugar reform and banana reform.
These are very small island economies, small states, and they need our support.
I hope the Commissioner will take that message back to her colleagues.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should like to start by echoing the words of Commissioner Kroes, who congratulated the rapporteur on the sterling work she has done.
It is indeed true that a reduction in the sugar price in Europe will lead to a drop in the income of the 18 ACP countries, but the sugar price that they receive will still be twice as high as the world market price.
What I see as particularly important is that this extra money will not end up in the pockets of a handful of traders, but will mainly benefit the poorest farmers, the ordinary farmer.
That is why the Commission needs to keep us up-to-date.
Secondly, not only is it important for the countries in question to export sugar, but sugar cane can also be used for different purposes.
In Brazil, about half of the sugar cane is currently used for the production of alcohol.
Well, if cars can run on alcohol there, then so can they elsewhere in the tropics, and I think we ought to offer those countries as much expertise as possible in order to achieve this.
Sugar cane can even be used as cattle fodder.
The 40 million that has been mentioned before is probably the maximum, in my opinion.
If it were to transpire that more than this 40 million were required, an additional budget should be submitted if the money can come from different sources.
I am not as optimistic as Commissioner Kroes about the level of funds that will become available for foreign aid in the next financial perspectives.
I am familiar with the Commission proposals, but if have interpreted the latest noises from the Council correctly, then the Commission might well end up being somewhat disappointed in this area.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, this report is proof that qualified market access is urgently needed for products from developing countries.
By this I mean that these countries should be paid on our terms, so that they can develop their national economies.
The report also reveals that liberalisation, which follows the colonial principle whereby the former colonies supply us with cheap food while we then sell industrial products to them, is both disastrous and dangerous.
Liberalisation of this kind causes hunger and poverty, and it costs billions.
The necessary reduction in quantities could have been achieved equally well by administrative means, without any need for this money.
I would ask MrÂ Gahler to take a closer look at the figures; sugar beet farmers will receive only 10% of this billion-euro sum, with the rest channelled into the restructuring fund for the sugar industry.
This is absolutely scandalous, since an enormous amount could have been achieved with this money had it been spent on development aid, or on fostering economic development in the rural areas of these regions.
Â Â  . Madam President, the changes to the sugar regime will achieve the double whammy of destroying the livelihood of sugar producers in Member States and in the developing world.
According to in the UK, next season, British sugar beet growers will start facing deep price cuts and the possibility of factory closures.
One of the ACP countries, St Kitts and Nevis, has already stopped sugar production and it will not be an isolated case.
The chairman of the ACP Sugar Group, Mr Arvin Boollel, has said that, following the EU decision, it is very likely that we are all going to suffer from the St Kitts and Nevis situation.
He said: âWe have been shot in the legs and asked to run the marathonâ.
His country knows all about being shafted by the EU.
He is the Agriculture Minister of Mauritius, one of the many developing nations subject to the EUâs scandalous fishing agreements.
Only EURÂ 40Â million is on the table.
The ACP countries call it peanuts.
The Jamaican Foreign Minister, MrÂ Knight, described it as a miserly approach, a very evocative and relevant thing to say at this time of year.
It will not be a sweet Christmas for sugar producers, be they in East Anglia or East Africa.
They all know that if the EU and its Scrooges are the answer, it must have been a stupid question.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
Once again the European Union is in the difficult position of having to reconcile compliance with its international commercial obligations and the introduction of policies to foster the development of its poorest partners and to defend the interests of its citizens, particularly those working in sectors at risk.
I therefore applaud all the measures taken by the Commission to limit the negative impact of sugar imports from producer nations and to compensate any losses resulting from it.
As a member of the Committee on Development and sensitive to problems affecting the poorest countries, I agree with the proposal to back the reform with additional aid for the 18 ACP Protocol states.
It is extremely important to assist our partners during the transition period to enable them to overcome their economic dependency on a single product, a dependency which makes the economies of entire countries highly vulnerable not only to market fluctuations but also to the natural disasters which hit the Caribbean and Pacific regions with increasing frequency.
I also agree with the proposal of the rapporteur â whom I should like to thank â to give priority to converting the sector to other non-food products such as bio-ethanol.
Once again it is important to ensure the consistency of such proposals by making adequate financial resources available.
Â Â  Madam President, perhaps Mr Wise might support an amendment to shift EURÂ 40Â million from the compensation package for UK farmers to the ACP countries to provide us with the EURÂ 80Â million we are asking for in this report.
The reform of the sugar regime has caused considerable turmoil in a number of Member States, including my own country, Ireland, but they have been bought off with billions of euros.
Whatever dislocation the reform of the sugar industry is causing in the European Union, the impact on ACP countries, and people there who are already poor and barely subsisting, could be catastrophic.
Like many others in this House, I am deeply concerned that the financial reference amount of EURÂ 40Â million, earmarked by the Commission for 2006, is grossly inadequate.
Commissioner, a promise of more in 2007 is simply that: a promise.
It carries no weight whatsoever in this House or anywhere else, given the turmoil the financial perspectives are in at the moment.
We must avoid robbing Peter to pay Paul.
The money we find for the ACP countries has to be new money.
It should be made available immediately and it should be complementary.
Our declarations of wanting to make poverty history have to be backed up with actions and with hard cash.
Â Â  Madam President, there are three points I should like to emphasise in this context.
Firstly, the sugar reform really is not nearly thorough enough and does not even come close to rectifying the scandalous imbalances that exist in the relationship between the EU and the sugar-producing countries.
Secondly, compensation for the ACP countriesâ sugar farmers should be at the same level as for the EUâs producers in the sugar industry. This is something that the financial benefits resulting from the reform could easily pay for.
Thirdly, it is quite wrong-headed of us to want to meet the challenge presented by the sugar reform by allowing the developing countries to produce bioethanol.
The ACP countriesâ dependence on Europe will probably only be exacerbated if they are now locked into producing sustenance for our cars instead of food for people.
The consequences of such a strategy for global food production could be quite disastrous.
Â Â  Madam President, it is only right that the changes to the EUâs sugar regime should go hand in hand, as they do, with accompanying measures, for the reduction of guaranteed prices affects not only our own sugar industry, but also the sugar exporters from the ACP countries.
What is important is that aid from the European Union should make a considerable contribution to greater competitiveness of the industry in the ACP countries, particularly by higher efficiency and greater diversification.
After all, those countries need no longer be so dependent on their sugar production in nine yearsâ time.
It is also important for the ACP countries to become competitive to such a degree that they can, in time, hold their own in the face of competition from third-country exporters, such as Brazil, without the EUâs guaranteed price.
This is the transformation in respect of which the EUâs sugar policy can, and indeed must, give guidance to the ACP countries and the European sugar industry.
The funds required for this must come from Chapters 4 and 1 of the European budget, as this is, after all, a matter of development and agriculture.
Â Â  . Madam President, the message from nearly all the honourable Members is loud and clear and makes sense.
I am grateful for the constructive and very positive involvement of nearly all of you.
I can assure you that the Commission welcomes the amendments proposed by your rapporteur.
That said, I wish to make a few comments about your remarks.
Firstly, Mr Mulder wants to be kept informed about the whole project.
I am sure the Commission will be able to do that.
He is very negative about how things will progress during the next few days.
Let us hope things will progress well.
In any case, the future for the financial perspectives looks positive.
Mrs McAvan made some very inspiring remarks.
However, I wish to correct her on one issue concerning KLM.
I think I know that airline a little better than her.
Even if there were a subsidy for the runway, it would never be given to an airline but to the airport.
I am not sure whether that is the case, but I wanted to make that remark.
Nearly everyone commented on the sum of EURÂ 40Â million for 2006.
Some were more enthusiastic about the amount of money than others.
However, that is the amount available.
What happens after 2006?
That is when the real work will begin, because that is when we have to fulfil our promises to those countries.
I can assure you that when, and only when, an agreement is reached on the financial perspectives, the Commission plans to allocate a figure of EURÂ 190Â million in addition to the existing development budget.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The June List welcomes the reform of the EUâs sugar sector and finds it encouraging that this sector too is being adjusted to the market.
This should have happened earlier.
We are critical of the EUâs export subsidies to domestic sugar producers and take a positive view of the fact that it will be possible for the sugar trade to take place under fairer conditions in the future.
Without going into details of the budget, I wish to emphasise that extensive financial aid alone will not solve the problems that sugar sector reform may entail for the ACP countries.
Financial aid does not guarantee longer-term conversion and restructuring of the ACP countriesâ sugar sectors and industries.
I am also looking for clearer strategies and priorities governing those things for which the financial resources are specifically to be used.
Otherwise, there is a significant danger of our only offering the ACP countries a form of artificial respiration and of the aid being given by the EU not having the intended effect.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0364/2005) by MrÂ Koterec, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the role of direct State aid as a tool of regional development (2004/2255(INI)).
Â Â  . The provision of state aid is an issue that has long been the focus of attention in the European Union, for the reason that differences in approach and in the resources deployed by the various Member States have led to unfair competition, favouring some companies and distorting economic development across regions and even states of the European Union.
Uncoordinated state aid has also distorted the Communityâs basic objectives in the area of cohesion.
It was therefore only natural that the Union should start to regulate state aid and that the bodies of the Community should increasingly strive, within the context of such experience, to develop a unified approach in this area.
When the opportunity came along of producing a report for the European Parliament on the Commissionâs draft guidelines dealing with regional aid as a tool of regional development, I viewed it as an invitation to contribute towards improving the way the Community functions in this area.
It is an area that attracts widespread attention not only because of the practice of providing significant cash injections for private companies, but also because of the way that taxpayersâ money is used for what may be seen as private purposes, albeit where there is a clear public interest.
The long process of negotiation between the Commission, the Council, Parliament and other interested parties, which eventually took a year despite the modest scope of the issue, provided confirmation of the complexities involved in the task of seeking to balance regulation in this area.
In July of this year, the Commission presented the revised proposal which forms the basis of my current report and which itself is based on the second informal draft and on the previously mentioned negotiations.
I can say that I broadly welcome the Commissionâs decision to pursue a philosophy of providing less and better-targeted state aid, in fulfilment of the Barcelona and Gothenburg European Councilsâ conclusions concerning reductions in the level of state aid and its focus on subjects of common interest, including economic and social cohesion.
Taking account also of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, I have concluded that the Commissionâs interest is to provide clear support for the fulfilment of cohesion objectives. I say this because I am convinced that the provision of state aid and assistance programmes through structural funds are two complementary instruments for the EU to employ in pursuit of cohesion.
That is why I think also that it is so important to support the Commission proposals for providing state aid under the process of convergence with EU standards to regions located mainly in the new Member States.
It is fanciful to think that state aid can be properly regulated in the interests of fair economic competition without taking full account of all the aspects of cohesion.
In my original draft of the report I sought to emphasise the above-mentioned approach, along with the need for an equitable distribution of state aid throughout the whole of the EU.
I also stressed that we must not neglect any region or sub-region where state aid is needed in order to achieve cohesion.
My aim was to back those proposals that would make the Commissionâs regional aid guidelines a real tool for the support of regional development.
During the approval process I was happy to accept any amendment proposals that coincided with these aims, and that is why I supported the idea of including statistical regions in the category under ArticleÂ 87(3)(a) for the provision of relevant state aid to all regions with natural handicaps or disadvantages that make it impossible for them to initiate development, or regions that have for various reasons fallen into the group of poor areas, as well as proposals restricting the destructive relocation of enterprises receiving state aid, and others.
I was also happy to add proposals requesting that the criteria for determining the entitlement to state aid for individual regions and firms be defined as precisely as possible, and I expect the Commission to make a thorough assessment of the negative impacts of inappropriately provided aid and to draw the appropriate conclusions.
In my report, I fully supported the idea of taking regional factors into account in the horizontal guidelines for the provision of state aid.
It will not be possible, however, to implement effectively all of the Commissionâs well-intentioned proposals for the regional aid guidelines or the related recommendations from the European Parliament unless the procedures are simplified, which the Commission has to a large extent suggested as well.
Implementation will also require complete transparency over the provision of state aid both at the national and European levels, including the integration of state aid for regional development into the national reference framework.
The recommendations for integrating regional self-government into the process of state aid distribution, for the publication of all cases of state aid on the Internet, and for public access to the assessments of the implementation of state aid instruments for regional development carried out by the Commission will certainly contribute to this.
Madam President, I must say that the final text of my report differs somewhat from my expectations.
Along with many fellow Members who participated in the creation of the final text, I have had to cut back my plans for an objective assessment of the Commissionâs proposals.
Some of the recommendations may go beyond the frame of reference defined in the principles set out by the Commission, but I trust that the Commission will examine all well-intended recommendations from Parliament.
Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the regions affected by poverty and inadequate development are looking to the guidelines we are proposing in the hope that they will contribute effectively to their development.
Only then will they be able to say, along with all of us who are working for the successful advancement of the whole European Union together, that Community instruments are the right means for ensuring the welfare of all citizens of the Union.
Â Â  . Madam President, the review of the regional aid rules is an integral part of the general reform of state aid policy, as was mentioned by the rapporteur.
The overall objective is to adjust the state aid rules to the new approach to the structural funds for 2007-2013, and to give practical effect to the conclusions of the European Council, which call for less and better targeted state aid.
Regional aid reform implies strict control of the more distortive aids by limiting the scope for investment aid for large firms to the regions most in need, in particular, as regards very large investment projects.
The reform also allows Member States a sufficient degree of flexibility to design aid matters to promote the realisation of the Lisbon objectives and targets.
That additional flexibility is just one of the elements which was introduced into the package as a result of consultation, including my discussions with the Committee on Regional Development.
Our approach is coherent with the state aid action plan, which recognises the need to allow regional aid in order to promote cohesion and convergence but emphasises that this should be targeted on the regions most in need.
Let me reiterate the importance of the principle of concentration.
If the aid is spread too thinly and too widely, it simply will not help the regions most in need.
We also provide for limited additional coverage, which is put at the disposal of the Member States concerned.
Naturally, we expect Member States to target that aid on the areas most in need at national level and it is up to them to identify those areas.
When I read the report, I feel bound to say that we are being asked to spread this form of aid too widely.
The assumption seems to be that areas which are not eligible for regional aid are not eligible for any form of state aid.
Allow me to correct that impression: according to the latest state aid scoreboard, the type of aid we are talking about today â regional aid â makes up less than 20% of all state aid granted in the EU, excluding the agricultural, fisheries and transport sectors.
Those regions not eligible for regional aid will continue to receive other forms of support through the horizontal aid measures that are covered by the state aid action plan: aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, research and development, innovation, training, employment and risk capital.
Following a very extensive consultation process, I believe we are moving towards a global compromise that should meet the legitimate concerns of the vast majority of Member States.
No compromise is perfect and some limited adjustments to the text are always possible.
However, I will study your proposals very carefully before putting a final package before the College next week for adoption.
However, it will not be possible significantly to modify the overall balance that has been struck in the guidelines; otherwise we would risk upsetting the large majority of Member States which welcome and support our text, and might call the whole exercise into question.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the factors that influence businesses when they are deciding whether or not to invest in a particular region is the extent to which they will receive support in the form of State aid.
This aid therefore also contributes to economic growth and job creation in the region in question.
It is entirely natural that most State aid is granted in the European Unionâs neediest regions, since it helps to reduce regional disparities, similarly to the Structural Funds.
The priority should therefore be to use State aid inÂ convergence regions, pursuant to ArticleÂ 87(3)(a).
The same Article must also, however, apply to regions affected by the statistical effect, as demanded in the Third Progress Report on economic and social cohesion, and it must continue to apply until the end of the programming period in 2013.
The obligation to maintain investment within the relevant regions must remain in place for at least five years â I repeat, five years â after the investment.
Seven years would have been preferable, but five years is the absolute minimum needed in order to prevent âinvestment hoppingâ wherever possible.
This five-year period should be enforced in the case of both large companies and SMEs, in order to avoid State aid being used as an incentive to relocate jobs to other areas of the EU, and as a source of funding for large-scale redundancies and plant closures.
If State aid is used, monitored and analysed correctly, it can be a useful tool to boost growth and job creation.
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â MadamÂ President, I should like to focus on merely two aspects of this complex and highly sensitive issue.
The first of these is the relocation of businesses.
It goes without saying that noÂ one in this European Union of ours wants businesses to relocate their operations with the sole purpose of qualifying for aid.
There have already been cases in every Member State, however, where the regions were glad to have the opportunity to provide State aid for investments, with the support of the European Union.
What we need here are regulations that are not only clear and transparent, but also fair and guided by the principle of solidarity.
This is what the report calls for, and I hope that the Commission will play its part in achieving such regulations.
The second aspect relates to the regions affected by the statistical effect, to which MrÂ Berend has already referred.
I fail to understand how it can be possible, given that CommissionerÂ HÃŒbner has always supported our decision to treat the statistical effect regions as ObjectiveÂ 1 regions for the entire 2007-2013 period â and this decision was backed by a large majority â for MrsÂ Kroes now to put forward an entirely different idea, namely that this period should be divided into two parts.
I hope that the Commission will start to realise that Parliament can also have good ideas now and again, and that it is entirely justified in wanting to provide support to the statistical effect regions.
Â Â  . â Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report.
I was a little disappointed to hear the comments of the Commissioner that only minor changes will be accommodated.
I was certainly pleased that our committee supported the amendments to maintain as ArticleÂ 87(3)(a) the status of the statistical effect regions for the entire programming period.
I also fully supported the call for the economic development regions to be entitled to the maximum levels of aid intensity with their transitional arrangement for these regions.
In the case of my own region, the BMW region in Ireland, this will help to ensure that there is not a sudden fall in aid levels but rather a gradual change, which will not cause too severe a shock to the system.
Furthermore, I commend the proposal to create a safety net, to ensure that no Member State loses more than 50% of its population covered during 2000-2006 because that will allow Member States the flexibility to intervene in certain areas where necessary.
I want briefly to raise another issue in the context of state aid, which is not dealt with by this report but is critical nonetheless.
Sometimes state aid rules hinder EU regions from competing with non-Member regions and states for mobile investment projects.
The Commissioner referred to Lisbon and, in order to achieve the objectives of more and better jobs, EU regions must be competitive within Europe but equally competitive with the rest of the world.
We do not exist in a vacuum and we must look outwards as well as inwards.
It should be possible for the EU to devise a system whereby Member States and regions can compete with non-Member States for mobile projects, while at the same time ensuring that Member States do not attempt to outbid each other.
In this context, I believe that we need an assessment of the impact that state aids have in determining if a project can be located in the EU with state aid, or outside the EU without state aid.
Â Â  . â Madam President, in my one minute I have little time for context or subtlety on this convoluted report, although I will say that I hope colleagues will take the opportunity tomorrow to clear up some slightly regrettable inconsistency and imprecision that have crept into it.
If that chance is not taken tomorrow then, with regret, I suspect that my group will be unable to support it.
The key points for us are: the safety net, the period in which investment has to be maintained within the region, and the de minimis criteria.
Although there have been some welcome steps forward on the position of statistical effect regions, we believe we could have done somewhat better in this field.
I would urge colleagues to support our amendments, which bring some much needed clarity to this report.
I would echo Mrs Harkinâs disappointment at the words of our Commissioner this evening.
I would urge you, Commissioner, to pay heed to the opinion of this House, which I believe has worked productively in this business.
I hope that we can continue in that manner.
Â Â  . â We welcome the compromise that has been reached and trust that it will not be amended; in other words, the arrangements regarding state aid that apply to the regions affected by the statistical effect will continue to apply to convergence objective regions, as is being proposed for the outermost regions.
As the report confirms, cohesion policies and state aid policies are complementary.
State aid is a key instrument available to Member States to promote regional development and genuine convergence between the various countries of the EU.
It is also an important lever in promoting public investment and sustainable economic development, and in ensuring that public services are provided in the least favoured regions.
High quality public services are a crucial factor in implementing the objective of social, economic and territorial cohesion.
Each State must define its public sectors and services, its suitable financing and its organisation.
Under no circumstances, therefore, must these areas fall within the scope of the implementation of rules on state aid.
Member States must be able, in compliance with the subsidiarity principle, to use this instrument to respond appropriately to the specific needs relating to the development of the least favoured regions.
Competition in international trade is putting increasing pressure on the least favoured regions, by causing the closure and relocation of companies and increased unemployment, which has a terrible impact on the development of many regions, not least in countries such as Portugal.
We therefore say once again that the Member States, with EU backing, have a duty to take action to address these situations, be it through state aid or other funding measures.
We also feel that the obligation to maintain investment in the regions for a minimum period of five years is woefully inadequate and must be increased.
State aid must not promote the relocation of companies, either in full or in part, within or outside the EU.
We believe that the state aid awarded to companies should be subject to a long-term commitment in terms of the duration of the investment, the number of jobs created and guarantees on workersâ rights.
Money should be returned in the event of non-compliance.
Furthermore we believe that the relative wealth of the regions and consequent eligibility for this aid should be based on GDP per capita.
With new indicators being incorporated, we believe that the populationâs level of qualifications is a relevant factor.
These are just some of the proposals that we put forward.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is very tempting to offer all of Europeâs poorer regions vast subsidies, but perhaps we should remember that West Germany has already spent some EUR 900 billion trying to create a level playing field for their relatively small neighbour, East Germany.
That should ring serious alarm bells, but we are turning a deaf ear.
The eight eastern European countries that have already joined the EU, plus Bulgaria and Romania, have been promised EURÂ 139Â billion out of the total structural funds budget of EURÂ 336Â billion for the period 2007 to 2013.
An exhibition that the Dutch Presidency put on in Brussels last December predicted that another ten impoverished countries will join the EU by 2022.
Based on Germanyâs experience, the costs will be absolutely astronomical and attainable only if the big three Member States â Germany, Britain and France â are prepared to impoverish themselves in the process.
It is about time we scrapped this whole crazy idea and helped out those poorer countries by creating opportunities for increased trade, tourism, etc.
I can well believe that Tony Blair will agree to impoverish Britain in his quest for European popularity, but I cannot imagine Mr Chirac doing the same thing to France.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when discussing the role of State aid as a tool of regional development, we should not forget that such aid always comes out of taxpayersâ pockets in one way or another.
It should therefore be distributed on the basis of clear and transparent criteria, and targeted at areas where it really will produce the desired results.
If these principles are followed, State aid will help individual EU regions to develop more rapidly.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to present an annual report on the actual amount of State aid granted by each Member State.
After all, this type of aid is a clear-cut case of interference in the free market.
It goes without saying that this interference is more often than not justified, but it is certainly not justified when it is used to support inefficient companies.
We should bear this in mind in view of the growing interest in the use of public-private partnerships to implement a variety of infrastructure investments.
Although such interest is otherwise legitimate, these partnerships offer a great temptation for all sorts of abuses, which we can only hope will be resisted.
According to the information at my disposal, around EURÂ 62Â billion was spent on State aid last year in the EU as a whole. EURÂ 17.2Â billion of this figure was spent in Germany, EURÂ 8.9Â billion in France, EURÂ 7Â billion in Italy and only EURÂ 2.9Â billion in Poland.
I have my doubts as to whether this money was spent in an entirely rational manner.
There are not enough forms of aid for what are known as horizontal investments, examples of which include support for small and medium-sized enterprises, environmental protection measures, the development of research and the stimulation of innovation.
The Commissioner herself said as much a few moments ago.
This should be the main focus of State aid, as it is only by prioritising such goals that it will contribute to the real development of individual regions.
Sectors or large companies that perform poorly should only receive public funds on a temporary basis, and only when these funds are genuinely used for restructuring activities and to increase the profitability of businesses.
If this is not the case, public funds will simply go to waste.
State aid that directly or indirectly supports regional development should promote territorial, social and economic cohesion.
It should serve as a unique tool for implementing a policy of alignment, which would be an expression of solidarity between the Member States and within the Community as a whole.
In this context, I believe that the initiative of the Polish Government, aimed at launching a programme for Eastern Poland, is eminently sensible.
Eastern Poland covers regions that have the lowest GDP per capita in the EU, such as Subcarpathia, Lubelszczyzna and Podlasie.
Urban conurbations act as metropolitan centres for local regions, and merit particular attention.
The recent events in French cities are proof that the consequences of social exclusion can be truly dramatic.
In addition, we should not neglect regions suffering high unemployment, which is an affliction that is sometimes passed from generation to generation.
Rural areas are another key focus of action, since an increasing number of challenging economic, social and demographic problems are encountered there.
In my opinion, it is essential that a clear definition of âeligible costsâ be provided, so that the Member States are in a position to take final decisions.
I should like to conclude by voicingÂ my support for the report that has been tabled on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, provided that the additional amendments to it are adopted.
Â Â  â Madam President, I am pleased to see that the new rules on state aid no longer contain the deliberate and disgraceful undermining of undertakings in border areas of the Czech Republic, which Germany tried to foist on the Commission.
The original proposal did not measure the difference in aid on the basis of GDP levels, but only on whether two different regions had state borders.
This supremely discriminatory and inconsistent rule has been replaced, under pressure from Member States, by a different, rule, which one can say is at least consistent.
The state borders between regions no longer play a role.
The problem was supposedly solved by bringing in regions affected by the statistical effect of enlargement.
This technical terminology is misleading in the extreme, however, in that it covers enormous differences in the development levels of individual regions.
In the Algarve region of Portugal, for example, or the LÃŒneburg region of Germany, GDP stands at over 80% of the EU average, whereas in the South West of the Czech Republic the figure is only 60.5% of the EU average.
Yet all of these regions will have a right to a virtually identical level of aid, which is neither fortunate nor fair, and which is certainly not in keeping with the spirit of solidarity.
The new rules on national regional aid were also intended to strengthen the EUâs competitiveness and economic growth, and that is something that the Commission has not come close to achieving.
The rules on aid in place before, which were workable on the whole, have been drastically watered down.
There is no doubt in my mind that the new rules will lead neither to economic growth nor to the creation of new jobs.
Â Â  â Madam President, I believe that Parliament understands the Commission's intention of less and better targeted state aid, obviously with the emphasis on the poorer regions of the European Union.
Nonetheless, these restrictions on state aid must also have a limit.
A large and simultaneous reduction in the appropriations received by the regions through the Structural Funds, on the one hand, and in state aid, on the other, risks turning out to be a disaster for their essential development.
Obviously, one such example, as already pointed out, is the regions which fall victim to the statistical effect and see subsidies through the Structural Funds limited as a result of enlargement, on the one hand, and the European Commission saying they may be able to get state aid up to 2009, but that from 2009 onwards there will be problems, on the other.
This is unfair. This has been pointed out repeatedly by Parliament and in the Koterec report.
This is the third time that this has been pointed out and the Commission needs to take it into account.
Similarly, the problem of the islands needs to be addressed, especially in relation to the additional cost of transport for island regions.
I have examples from Greece which illustrate that the cost of transport on the islands is three times that needed to travel the same distance on the mainland.
My final comment is that we need to look carefully at the risk of company relocations.
It must be made clear both by us and by the Commission that companies which receive state aid need to stay where they were when they received the subsidies for at least five years.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, in the light of MrÂ Hatzidakisâs proposals, I would like, if I may be so bold, to use a well-known phrase that you may remember: âFear notâ.
Fear not, Commissioner.
Do you believe that, in these financially difficult times, there are governments with sufficient resources to distribute funds generously among all the regions?
Do you believe that there are governments crazy enough to allocate money to the regions, in the knowledge that their investments will be frittered away over the next few years?
Fear not, Commissioner.
As you said just a moment ago, these sums make up less than 20% of State aid.
Fear not, Commissioner.
You personally stated just now, at the start of your speech, that strict controls would be put in place, and MrÂ Koterec, whom I congratulate on his high-quality work, stressed that there were indicators such as unemployment levels and so on.
Rest assured, Commissioner, that, if the safety net is increased to 25%, the Member States will make good use of the indicators you have put in place, in the interests of Europe and of our fellow citizens.
Madam President, I thank Mr Koterec for his work and commend his report to the Commissioner.
State aid is consistent with structural fund policies and it can contribute to social and economic cohesion.
More flexibility would be important in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, to allow for a proper response to the specific development needs of individual, less-favoured regions.
I want, in particular, to welcome the reportâs assertion that the natural effect regions and the economic development regions should be eligible for a more flexible regime of state aid in the future.
It is particularly important to ensure that such regions can receive the maximum for a time and maintain their positive economic development trajectories after 2006, and that areas are not left behind as the economy improves and develops.
I would also like to stress, as others have, the need for firms to remain in the region for which they have received the aid.
Â Â  I should just like to remind the House that Mrs de BrÃºn sometimes starts and ends her speeches in Irish, for which there is not yet any interpretation.
She knows that, we know that.
Â Â  It is now five minutes to midnight, both literally and figuratively speaking.
A key aspect in the debate over direct state aid as a tool of regional development is the threatened application of the British proposal to reduce financial assistance for new members from the European Unionâs structural funds for 2007â2013.
A reduction in assistance would increase the risk of failure in terms of the desired aims of state aid in the new Member States, as it is often the case that these states simply do not have any funding of their own for these purposes.
If they did, we would be approaching state aid, the problems of less advanced regions and the issue of cohesion in a completely different way.
In addition, there is a lack of proper analysis and of verifiable studies into the impact of the decisions under consideration.
Ladies and gentlemen, the proposed resolution of the Committee on Regional Development and rapporteur Koterec is good, but it will be meaningful only if the level of assistance for new Member States remains unchanged.
Â Â  Â Â Â MadamÂ President, todayâs debate is not directly concerned with European solidarity, the cohesion policy or the sharing out of EU funds.
In reality, however, it is not too far removed from debates on the solidarity principle or on the factors driving economic development, in particular those factors that promote or hinder the existence of functioning economies in the Member States.
Decisions on State aid granted at regional level fall entirely within the jurisdiction of the European Commission.
At the same time, however, Parliament cannot merely be a passive observer of developments in this field, given that it is working actively on a legislative package on cohesion policy.
Particular emphasis should therefore be placed on a point made in the report, namely that we expect the Commission to delay its adoption of a position until the new Financial Perspective is agreed on, and until the budget for cohesion policy is adopted.
Regulations on levels of State aid should, if they are formulated correctly, heighten the impact of structural interventions rather than curtailing economic freedoms, by which I also mean business activity.
State aid should not become an alternative means of artificially prohibiting such measures as the relocation of businesses.
Economic activities in the Member States should also be targeted at creating an environment that is conducive to investment in the EU, and at establishing favourable operating conditions that enable forward planning for businesses, rather than at imposing artificial prohibitions that disrupt relations between EU Member States.
The consultation of regional and local authorities on the criteria for identifying aid-recipient regions is also absolutely essential.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to thank Mr Koterec for his work.
We are talking about a reduced level but improved targeting of state aid in order to provide an effective response to the challenges of economic globalisation, enlargement and the need to restore the Unionâs competitiveness.
However, there is the risk that some areas will be penalised: state aid must be used to promote competitiveness and innovation, research and development across the whole territory of the European Union.
In that context, it would be particularly desirable to create a transition mechanism for the statistical effect regions.
I would therefore ask the Commission to take account of the new wording of paragraph 7 of the text of the Koterec report, as approved in the Committee on Regional Development.
I invite the European Commission to take note of this and to take the appropriate action, and also to take greater account of the rate of unemployment in a region when determining its status.
Â Â  â State aid is normally seen as something detrimental to competition.
The Treaty of the European Union acknowledges, however, that such aid is acceptable when it is intended to contribute towards the economic development of those regions in which the standard of living is well below the European average.
The principle whereby active public policy is justified when it is intended to boost social cohesion is thus enshrined.
While the free functioning of the market brings benefits in terms of economic development, it alone cannot ensure development.
In terms of regional policy, therefore, this kind of state aid could serve to support the least favoured regions.
Accordingly, given that state aid and regional policy are complementary, they need to be brought closer together.
In this regard, I agree with the rapporteur that regions affected by the statistical effect should be subject to the same arrangements as the convergence objective regions.
I turn now to globalisation, which has brought a fresh problem to the EUâs table, to which I have repeatedly drawn the Houseâs attention.
The problem centres on the fact that regions and sectors built, economically speaking, on manufacturing, run the risk of being wiped off the map.
In order to redress this trend, the EU has put forward the idea of the globalisation adjustment fund, an initiative that I support, albeit on the proviso that it be implemented only in regions that, according to likely trends, are at acute social risk.
This fund must therefore be highly selective and applied only in exceptional circumstances.
The focus must be on those regions that fulfil three key characteristics at any given time: high rate of population concentration, high unemployment and specialisation across a range of sectors.
Â Â  Commissioner, the Commissionâs latest proposals on national regional aid constitute a step forward, as each Member State can retain zones eligible for national aid thanks to the creation of a safety net.
Nevertheless, this measure results in a considerable reduction in support, which is inconsistent with the trends in the macroeconomic indicators in some of our regions.
It would therefore be a good idea to increase the safety net.
Indeed, reducing minimum coverage by considerably less than the 50% proposed would enable us to do justice to the situation in States where the statistical divisions do not take account of regional disparities.
On the same note, although I am pleased to note that the outermost regions are still eligible under ArticleÂ 87(3)(a), I find it regrettable that the new proposals are not able to compensate for the announced reduction in aid.
The level of aid in the outermost regions must be looked at in a quite specific way, because it is vital to the survival of their economies, not just a competitive adjustment.
It is illogical to ask the outermost regions to cooperate with neighbouring countries that have much, much lower salary costs, while at the same time drastically reducing the aid provided to their businesses, which is a vital tool in re-establishing fair conditions for regional competition, which has been distorted.
The overseas territories absolutely must continue to benefit from a level of aid equal to that currently in force.
I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Development for adopting my amendment stressing that the guidelines should expressly provide Member States with the possibility of notifying aid projects and the Commission with the possibility of assessing the compatibility of these aid projects using more flexible criteria so that they can take account of any specific issues in the sector or region, and of innovative approaches.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, I support the basic premise of these reforms, which can be summed up as less, but more effectively targeted, state aid.
Ineffective state aid has a detrimental effect on the internal market and economic competitiveness.
The text under discussion is a balanced one, taking account of the needs of the poorest regions and those regions affected by the statistical effect.
I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission has retreated from its original proposal to reduce the intensity of state aid in neighbouring regions to the wealthiest countries, not least the Czech-German and Czech-Austrian border regions, which, as neighbours of the former Iron Curtain, have for many years lagged behind.
