This year, we expect three million tonnes' under-usage, so what is the great rush in this regard?
Secondly, in terms of the much talked-of soft landing, we need to have particular regard for those regions which have built their structure and their strategy supplying other regions which are currently limited in their production - regions such as my own constituency, which supplies across the border to the Republic of Ireland.
In terms of a soft landing, we need to find a long-term strategy and alternative outlets for regions such as this.
Mr President, I am wondering what producers who might be listening to this debate would think - it is so complex.
I congratulate Ms Jeggle for miraculous work in getting consensus.
However, those of you who have flown into the storms this week know that a soft landing depends on which way the wind is blowing and none of us know which way the wind will be blowing in a few years' time.
I would think that giving a 2% increase in quota - and the voluntary bit in my view does not rest with the Member States, it is the producers who decide whether to take it or not - will allow us to test the market, and we need to do that.
2% is not a massive increase for individual producers.
As for the concerns - and perhaps the Commissioner has thought too deeply about the balancing mechanism - you are heavily taxing producers who can produce while at the same time Member States do not want to produce.
We have had this argument already from other colleagues, so we need to do something about it.
Lastly, the WTO deal might make ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Jeggle very much for getting a difficult report together.
Can I just quickly say that 'faint heart never won fair maiden', and I think we need to be much bolder here.
Milk quotas are like a pressure cooker: you cannot keep the pressure on right to the end and then take it off, because it just bursts.
I am quite clear what a soft landing means, and that is to increase quotas significantly before we get to 2015, so I very much welcome this 2%.
I would say to the Commission and to the Council that we should be much bolder when we get to 2010.
Let us not look just to 1%, let us look to 2% and make sure that we do have a genuine soft landing for milk quotas.
Young farmers and new entrants have all been restricted over the years.
Now is our opportunity to give them this production.
At last milk trade is increasing in the world...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, milk is a highly sensitive product and I should like to thank Mrs Jeggle most sincerely for an effective compromise.
I particularly welcome the voluntary increase in milk quotas in the Member States.
I should like to point out the following, however. Anyone who continually cites the price of food as justification for an increase in quotas or overproduction completely overlooks the fact that dairy farmers do not receive even 30% of the sale price in the shops.
I believe we ought to be discussing this.
It is also essential that milk production can continue in mountainous regions and disadvantaged areas because it is often the only form of production taking place there.
We need a special programme here.
(NL) I shall skip the words of thanks and move on to saying that I welcome the proposal to increase the quota by 2%.
Personally, I would have preferred 3%, as the European Commission itself admits that 2% amounts to a mere 1% in practice, as not all countries make full use of their quotas, but I shall in any case support Mrs Jeggle's compromise of 2%.
To the European Commission I would say that this is not before time, as we were overtaken on the world market by New Zealand back in 2006.
Demand increased, so there was scope for exploiting opportunities, but we could not exploit them as we were constrained by the quota system.
This system had a role to play when there was overproduction but, now that demand has increased, we should develop another system that enables us to exploit those market opportunities.
In this context, I also think it a shame that the Health Check is evidently now looking at four 1% increases.
In my opinion, a real soft landing requires more of an increase than 1%.
Let us have the courage to do that.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would first like to thank all those present at the debate.
As always in Parliament, it was very complex and rich and highlighted all the problems and differences that exist among the Member States.
I would like to stress that the Presidency, and of course the European Parliament, undoubtedly gave this proposal enough time to be looked at from all sides.
If the conditions for adoption of this proposal are satisfied, taking into account the opinion of the European Parliament, this 2% increase will be used as from the next quota year, that is to say from 1 April 2008.
However, I would like to emphasise that this will not end the debate on the future of the dairy sector in the European Union.
Without doubt, it will continue in great depth within the framework of the so-called common agricultural policy health check.
I can guarantee here that the Presidency is firm in its decision to lead this debate and to reach our common goal, that is to say - and this has my assurance - a balanced long-term strategy for the European dairy sector.
Thank you again for taking part in this debate and my special thanks to the rapporteur.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think that, after the discussion here today, we can all agree that dairy production is still a very important part of our common agricultural policy.
It seems to me that today you could pick and choose between different opinions, covering the whole range from zero up to more than we have suggested in our proposal.
I think it has also shown the diversity that can be seen in different Member States, and that is perhaps a reason, in response to Mr Parish's remarks, for not being bold enough.
But at the end of the day we need to find a compromise between the various opinions.
I would just like to make a few comments on some of the issues that have been raised.
On this increase in quota, it is voluntary for Member States either to distribute it to the producers or to keep it in the national reserve.
My clear preference will be to distribute it.
Member States can give special preference to young farmers and those who are suffering as a result of the prices that they have to pay for the quotas.
I think that, if we want to introduce an increase as from 1 April, we need to do so with a fixed percentage in all Member States.
If we now start to discuss special figures or increased percentages for different Member States, there will be a battle that will go on for months.
So let us agree that what we are discussing now is a 2% across-the-board increase.
I actually do not think that we are so fundamentally divided in our opinions on where to go.
I think we can define our goal, but there may be some differences of opinion between the Commission and Parliament on how to get there.
I think we can all agree that we should not put the sector at risk.
This is exactly why I have proposed this soft landing.
A 'soft landing' actually means that we increase the quotas over the years and maintain a situation where, at the end of the quota system, in 2015, we do not see a very steep drop in prices overnight, which would be the result if we did nothing.
I therefore think we have chosen a proper and acceptable approach.
I do not underestimate that there may be regions in Europe - mountainous regions, vulnerable regions - where a total abolition of the quota system could put the continuation of milk production at risk.
Therefore, we will be prepared to look, during the health check, at solutions to help those regions.
I think the most proper tool is Article 69, a possibility for Member States to top-slice the direct payment to the farmers and use it for specific areas.
I do not consider the idea of setting up a milk fund for restructuring to be a solution. Where do we get the money from?
How much money do we get?
How do we distribute the money between the different Member States?
I think there are so many unanswered questions concerning this fund, and we have limited money.
We would have to take it from our own budget, and then other producers within the agricultural sector would have to pay for this restructuring fund.
So I do not think it would work.
In my opinion, the main reason for increasing milk production is the fact that we have emerging markets in Asia.
Why should we not take our share of those growing markets?
We know how difficult it is when others already have a foot in the door and we come afterwards and try to get our share.
We should be there from the very beginning with our high quality products.
Those dairy producers - dairies, industries that are doing well - are those that are producing high-quality products; here, in particular, it is cheese.
We have an extraordinary brand in Europe on high-quality cheeses, so why do we not use it and take our share?
As the Minister said, we will look again at this issue in the health check.
I am sure that will be as animated a debate as we have had today, because I think dairy production will never be boring.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard a wide range of opinions.
We were also able to detect that, for everyone here today, this is a serious issue not to be trifled with, that everyone has many concerns and that we are all, of course, accountable at home - to consumers on the one hand and to milk producers on the other.
To come back to the markets once again: whether I ought to believe in the Chinese market, I do not know.
We see a great deal in this European Union and on this market today.
However, we have an internal market here and this internal market helps us to be strong, even in the face of globalisation and general liberalisation.
Let us therefore make a European internal market out of this milk quota.
We used to be able to do this.
The agricultural markets can face up to the challenges and particularly the routine fluctuations of the world market only from a strong, stable and organised internal market.
For sustainable management, the economy, ecology and social aspects must be in harmony.
All three components must be equally to the fore of any action we take.
The European agricultural model represents sustainability and consumer safety - and that still applies!
Farmers do both very well.
They look after the landscape and therefore form the basis of tourism, contribute to energy security, produce top-quality food and maintain the economic basis for rural areas by providing employment.
The social benefits are offset less and less for farmers by what are referred to as compensatory payments.
Foodstuffs must increasingly have their fair price!
Our overall political responsibility is greater than merely treading the path of liberalisation with open markets!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) The report drafted by Mrs Jeggle is extremely important not only in terms of the proposals concerning the increase in milk quotas, but also in terms of defining certain principles that we must take into account when discussing agricultural policy as a whole.
Following the discussions of the Commission on agriculture and rural development we agreed that an increase in milk quotas is necessary for the Member States starting as soon as 1 April 2008.
In the EP, I represent Romania, a new Member State which was confronted even from the first year of accession with a crisis in the milk quota, which quota was insufficient to satisfy market demand and inconsistent with current realities.
The milk sector in Romania recorded major progress from the negotiation of the milk quota in 2004 to accession, through investments in modern technology, extension of production capacities and employment of new personnel.
Maintaining a milk quota at the level now provided would mean bankruptcy for investors, unemployment in rural areas specialised in the production and processing of milk and an increase in imports and the price paid by consumers.
The report represents a turning point as the European Union shows flexibility in solving a problem that several Member States are faced with.
After all, the beneficiaries of this report are European citizens.
The health check is an important process for reforming agricultural policy, particularly agricultural policy in mountainous regions.
The increase in the application of the milk quota is essential in these areas.
Special regulations must be decided here that are responsive to the particular circumstances of farming in the mountains.
The work of farmers is being made more difficult owing to reduced accessibility and steep transport routes and these must be included in the discussions.
For Austrian farmers, the milk quota regulation is essential.
EU-wide balancing out or trade in quotas should be considered.
Were it actually to come to an abolition of the dairy quota system in 2015, appropriate financial compensatory measures would be needed with additional budget funds in order to maintain milk production and processing in mountainous regions and on grazing and pasture land.
When checking the efficiency of market support instruments and their reorganisation and adaptation to the current situation, the particular situation of farming in mountainous regions should not be disregarded in any instance.
Milk production and processing is a very important component of agriculture in these regions and has a very high value.
Particular attention must be paid to the economic, social and ecological consequences of an increase or abolition of quotas, particularly in mountainous regions.
The complete abolition of the EU dairy quota system is the wrong path for Europe's common agricultural policy.
CAP 'Health Check' (debate)
The next item is the report by Lutz Goepel, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the CAP 'Health Check'.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the first round of parliamentary discussions on what is referred to as the health check of the common agricultural policy will conclude tomorrow.
This health check is not a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy.
It should further update the existing policy where appropriate, based on the experience gained since 2003, and adapt it to changed circumstances.
The Commission should take very serious note of our position.
It is a good basis for the upcoming negotiations on the legislative package, as well as for the budget review after 2013.
We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have supported the continuation of the reform towards greater personal responsibility and market orientation while at the same time emphasising the aspects of food safety and of social and environmental responsibility - particularly with regard to current market development and the new challenges of climate policy - more strongly than we have done in the past.
We also want greater flexibility for the Member States when changing the system - in other words, more opportunities to introduce further decoupling and the loosening of historical reference levels.
The debates in our committee have also revealed, however, that this is not sensible in all sectors, at least not before 2013.
For livestock premiums or for states with full decoupling, but which have a strong livestock sector, a sudden change of system would result in negative structural interruptions in view of the current market situation.
The same appears to be true with some of the smaller market regulations in the plant sector, such as, for example, the market regulations for potato starch, dry green fodder or rice, on which a regionally significant processing industry depends and has invested a great deal in recent years and has to service this with high interest rates.
The committee voted in favour of the introduction of a new, flexible instrument to promote dedicated environmental and region-specific production or particular sectors - in other words, Article 69 - and we have at the same time demanded that new measures be devised to protect the land against environmental crises and crises that are increasingly to be expected in view of the changing climate and increasing cross-linkage of agricultural markets.
A new form of public-private risk management should also be tested with this instrument, which is urgently needed in view of other instruments being returned and the new imponderables.
A few brief words on degression and modulation: our farmers expect planning to be reliable and it is simply inappropriate to once again curtail and redeploy between 8 and 53% of direct income aid with a compulsory 5% modulation only four years after implementation of the last reform.
By any understanding of the financing of the development of rural areas, confidence is being destroyed here and structural interruptions provoked.
These proposals specifically concern full-time farms and those that have improved their competitiveness in recent years through mergers into legal entities.
We have put forward proposals, however, for how the general policy targets and the economic requirements can be aligned with each other.
We have to break new ground in the interest of sustainability and competitiveness.
Above all we are grateful to all those who have cooperated on this own-initiative report and I would like to thank my colleagues and fellow Members across all the Groups in the Committee on Agriculture.
President-in-Office. - (SL) The Presidency of the Council welcomes the report by the rapporteur, Mr Goepel, as a very measured and resounding contribution to the debate.
The Council also worked hard to prepare the response to the Commission's report.
As you know, the ministers debated it at three sessions of the Council, namely in November, January and February.
Next week we, the ministers, will attempt to reach some conclusions regarding the report on the common agricultural policy health check.
We will start from some general principles.
For example, when the reform of the common agricultural policy was adopted in 2003, the Council clearly expressed its intention to evaluate the efficacy of the adopted reforms in the future and particularly to assess their effect on the set targets, as well as to analyse their effects on the agricultural markets.
It is also important to know that, when deciding on the common agricultural policy health check, we will take into account the conclusions of the European Council on the financial perspective for 2007-2013 and the European Council's appeal to the Commission to carry out a comprehensive EU budget and expenditure review for 2008-2009.
The Presidency agrees with the Commission that the common agricultural policy health check is an important part of the planned activities within the budget review for 2008-2009 and that it does not define its conclusions in advance.
We have established that the 2003-2004 reforms have largely achieved the set targets in terms of response to market conditions and in terms of making the common agricultural policy more accessible to the citizens.
Ministers are also convinced that, in its report, the Commission correctly assessed the main developments that followed the reforms adopted in 2003-2004.
The Council will pay special attention to three key questions: the single payment scheme, the role of marketing tools in assisting the market and, of course, the response to the present and future challenges of climate change risk management.
We will work to find the right balance between adapting the policy to new challenges and changed conditions and preserving a clear and stable framework.
On the subject of simplification, I would like to say that the European Union considers this question to be of key importance and we also expect the Commission to define concrete measures to reach this target.
As I have already said, the Council will try next week to adopt conclusions on these and many other issues, such as risk management, milk quotas, transition to the elimination of milk quotas, and questions regarding the second pillar.
Undoubtedly, your report will be a valuable contribution to a future debate on this matter.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, once again I want to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Goepel in particular for their hard work, resulting in an excellent report.
We are at the stage in the first round where we have consulted many stakeholders and different organisations and individuals to have their opinions and to collect different ideas.
The opinion of the European Parliament is crucial, together with the expected conclusions of the Council next week, as we work to finalise the legislative proposals scheduled to be adopted by the Commission on 20 May.
Immediately thereafter, on the same day here in Strasbourg, I will be presenting to the European Parliament the legal texts.
But, basically, I am quite happy to see that all the three institutions - the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission - although we have different 'shopping lists', are all in the same shop.
I will not go into detail on the different issues, but will give my view on the three most important ones.
Firstly, on direct payments: these are inevitably linked to the long-term security that we want to give to our farmers.
I therefore agree with the statement in your report that direct payments remain necessary as a basic income guarantee.
The single payment scheme gives a real lift to the competitiveness of our farmers, but we must make the system more effective, more efficient and simpler.
Therefore, I advocate further decoupling.
Our experiences with the 2003 reform show that the decoupling has been working quite well and, therefore, I think we should move further and extend the benefits of decoupling, except where coupled payments have a very solid justification.
I have also noticed that you support the idea of a more flexible Article 69 as a valuable tool.
However, we should not expect Article 69 to solve all the different problems, and I will fight any attempt to re-introduce coupled support through the backdoor using Article 69.
I will not go into detail about the dairy sector again, as we have already had this discussion.
However, I will just mention some of the market instruments: intervention and private storage.
Like you, I recognise that some of our market instruments still have a place, but we must keep them relevant to the European Union as it is now.
I am glad that we agree that they should play their role in the future as genuine safety nets.
Risks related to bad weather and outbreaks of animal diseases, as you highlight, are certainly a focus point in our discussion.
However, we are not starting from zero: the Council discussed this issue in 2005 and concluded that new measures at EU level should not interfere with what is already available in the different Member States.
We have to be sure that new measures do not interfere with farmers' ability to react to market signals, and they have to be compatible with the WTO system, where there has to be a loss of more than 30%.
Concerning modulation, I have made it clear on many occasions that we need to have for the future a very ambitious rural development policy.
I was very disappointed with the fact that, during the discussions on the financial perspective at the end of 2005, the Heads of State and Government agreed to take a significant part off the rural development funding.
However, I must say that your report is rather cool about my ideas in this area.
But I think that we can justify the fact that our rural development policy is financially overstretched.
If we have high expectations for our rural development policy, including the need, as the President-in-Office rightly said, to use it to meet new challenges, like water management and bio-diversity, then it does not work to load more tasks on to it without putting in more money.
I think modulation is the best way to provide more funding.
I have read with interest what you are proposing and I am sure we will come back to this issue.
If your report is cool on modulation, I would describe it as extremely chilly on reductions of payments to large farms - you call that 'degressivity'.
This is not an issue that can be simply ignored.
We know that with our transparency initiative, there will be a strong focus from all sides on the large sums of money going to single farmers and single landowners.
On the other hand, I take everyone's concerns on this issue very seriously.
And I have looked with interest at your report's concept of 'progressive modulation'.
I think there are some good ideas there that we would consider carefully on the legal proposals.
If I have been a little too long, it is only to show clearly my dedication and my huge interest in having the opportunity to discuss here in Parliament the future of the European agricultural policy.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (NL) I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Buitenweg, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, who is ill and has sent her apologies.
The Committee on the Environment drew up 17 recommendations, of which I shall highlight four.
1.
The Committee on the Environment welcomes the fact that, in its Communication, the European Commission intends to respond to the challenge of climate change and to support less intensive farming practices.
2.
The Committee on the Environment stresses the need to develop in the direction of sustainable, multifunctional agriculture, and in so doing takes a stand for conservation farming and organic farming.
3.
The European Commission is urged not to weaken the existing measures on cross-compliance - that is, measures on the environment and animal welfare and the compatibility of these - through so-called simplification.
On the contrary, in our view, cross-compliance should even be strengthened in certain areas, such as water use and management and water quality.
4.
The Committee warns the Commission to show a little more restraint regarding the concept of 'biofuels'.
Their benefit is questionable, and they are certainly not unequivocally good in either environmental or social respects.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Goepel for his report.
I believe he has brought together the whole committee and Parliament in a very good report.
I would suggest that the reform of agriculture is evolution, not revolution, and we are carrying on very much with the Fischler reforms.
I welcome much of what the Commission has put forward, along with Mr Goepel's report.
I think that one of the keys to the reform was to reduce bureaucracy to farmers and we still have some ground to cover.
Commissioner, yes, we are in the same shop but I think some of us believe we could spend the money on different things and that is probably what the arguments are now about.
Food security has come back on the agenda again very strongly, especially with the Far East in particular now buying more and more food.
Cereals have gone up almost two or two and a half times in price, so I believe we can start to re-evaluate as we move forward with reform how we spend the money.
We have to look again at modulation.
In my opinion we have to get rid of set-aside once and for all, because this common agricultural policy is a policy that is not supposed to be linked to production.
You cannot possibly carry on with set-aside which is exactly that.
We have to look at milk quotas and abolishing them by 2015.
Decoupled payments: that is the whole crux of the reform, and you are quite right to push that forward.
Again, I think that now is the time when agriculture can start to look towards a market-oriented price.
Yes, the common agricultural policy is necessary, but also the market is there and we should take much more advantage of it.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I should like also to welcome the President of the Council and the Commissioner.
The common agricultural policy always gives rise to heated debates and it is always difficult to reach consensus, but I note that we are all unanimous on the need to maintain a common agricultural policy whose objectives have just been confirmed in the Lisbon Treaty.
The PSE Group made great efforts in this debate, within the parliamentary group, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and with farmers' organisations, and we tabled more than half of the 600-plus amendments to the report by Mr Goepel and signed 15 of the 17 compromises encompassing dozens of amendments.
We worked hard and made significant concessions in order to achieve as broad a consensus as possible within Parliament and I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Goepel on his willingness for dialogue and on the real spirit of compromise he showed; I would also like to congratulate Mr Parish on the way in which he led our work in committee.
This is therefore the best compromise but it is not a socialist report.
This is not the report we would have drawn up; we find it quite backward looking and conservative in the face of the expectations of society and of farmers.
However, the overall trend of the report does not close the door to a more in-depth debate on the legislative proposal.
I hope we can retain the same spirit of compromise but be more ambitious in setting a new direction for European agriculture.
I am referring to the most sensitive issues, such as the direction and pace of the decoupling of aid, a mechanism for a fairer redistribution of support, the responsible approach for the future of the dairy sector, the new challenges, in particular the role of agriculture in combating climate change and the production of agrofuels, etc. We will be voting on this debate tomorrow with our eyes fixed on the future.
I call for a vote by a large majority in favour of this report as well as the improvements that the socialists will be introducing to make it a still more comprehensive report.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, in his characteristically competent way, the rapporteur, Mr Goepel, has prepared a report that contains the instruments necessary for clarifying and simplifying agricultural policy.
The case for maintaining a common agricultural policy after 2013 also comes across strongly - for which I am obliged to the rapporteur.
We support his positions on continued decoupling, so that the 2003 reform is implemented in all Member States.
We support the rapporteur's positions on market instruments and risk management in terms of crises, epidemics, animal welfare and the environment, modulation and degressivity.
We also support the further development of rural policy and increased focus on biofuels.
Substantial efforts should be made regarding cross-compliance and simplification, as the current situation is taking farmers out of their fields and stalls and into their studies to draw up diagrams and respond to monitoring.
Milk quotas should be abolished in 2015, so there is cause to increase milk quotas now by at least 2% and cushion the landing in 2009.
The growing demand for milk products will create the basis for European milk production, so that we shall be delivering what the market wants.
The report contains plenty on liberalisation and market economy that the Commission should use as a basis for its proposals in May, when the CAP health check will be on the table.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are among those who believe in and defend the continuation of the CAP even after 2012.
We feel that this report is a step in the right direction, but we cannot accept that the full decoupling of aid should not allow for the possibility of maintaining a partial coupling of aid for some specific sectors, to prevent the complete abandonment of production.
There are, in fact, whole sectors, such as the tobacco sector, that would disappear with the application of full decoupling, creating unemployment and various economic and environmental problems in particularly disadvantaged areas.
We consider the progressive modulation of aid rather an excessive and probably counterproductive measure if the objective is still to safeguard European agricultural production.
We recognise the importance of rural development, but we feel this cannot be achieved at the expense of the first pillar of the CAP.
Furthermore, it is necessary to continue to implement policies to support individual common organisations of the markets where this is necessary.
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union needs a common agricultural policy that manages to...
(The President cut off the speaker)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, you have attempted in a strategy paper to carry out a health check of agricultural policy, not so much in terms of agriculture, because that is going relatively well as the moment, even if not in all sectors.
The question was: is the agricultural policy up to date?
I have to say here: feverish displays on their own are not sufficient; we also have to develop appropriate treatment if deficiencies are diagnosed.
In fact you have diagnosed deficiencies; you have said as much yourself in your speech.
I do not want to go into details now, as that wastes too much time.
It now therefore depends on measures being taken that will also be socially acceptable.
What is essential is that agriculture has to contribute, of course, to the stabilisation of the climate.
It is doing so, but there are areas of agricultural production where it is becoming difficult to put forward proposals without restrictive intervention.
It is particularly important, however, that we ensure that public funds are distributed in such a way that the measures we consider necessary can be financed.
It is a disadvantage that what is referred to as the second pillar - rural development - has been curtailed in medium-term financial planning and has had to come to terms with cutbacks of more than EUR 20 billion according to the Commission's proposal and that of Parliament.
Consequently, we urgently need to reassign funds.
We also need to do this because we need social acceptance in 2013.
You have now put forward some proposals and here it must be to the credit of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and specifically the European Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Goepel, that he has bestowed practical relevance on the proposals you have put forward, which will subsequently lead to equal treatment among businesses that compete with one another.
You have proposed the introduction of degressivity of up to 45%.
On the suggestion of the rapporteur, the Committee on Agriculture has adopted this, but with the amendment that businesses with a large number of employees now also have an opportunity to evaluate their wage costs.
We were together in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania; we saw these businesses and you know that distortion of competition can be eliminated and justice created only if we introduce these measures.
I hope that you will also abide by this rule in your legislative proposal.
If not, we would still have the opportunity as Parliament to save ourselves in 2009.
Commissioner, we are in a codecision process and we therefore have a quite different and, for us, very comfortable position!
Mr President, this is an important moment to evaluate the consequences of successive reforms of the common agricultural policy, whether in terms of agricultural production or consumer supply, taking as the basis the protection of Member States' self-sufficiency in food, securing adequate supplies of healthy and safe food at low prices, respect for the environment and biodiversity, and maintaining rural areas and their populations, who need adequate incomes and access to public services that guarantee them decent living conditions.
Unfortunately the European Commission did not follow that path.
It does not acknowledge that the common agricultural policy has led to a paradoxical situation.
On the one hand, food prices are continuing to rise, and on the other hand family holdings are still being destroyed and more and more small and medium-sized holdings are abandoning production because they are not guaranteed decent incomes whereas speculation continues, driving up the prices of increasingly scarce food products.
It is therefore a mistake to insist on decoupling aid from production and employment and it is unacceptable to continue to pursue a policy of support for large-scale landowners and multinational food corporations whilst failing to value the farmers who maintain agricultural and livestock production on the basis of protecting biodiversity, food safety and product quality.
The 2003 reform exacerbated the situation.
The subsequent reforms of the common organisations of the markets in sugar, fruit and vegetables, tobacco and wine maintained the unfairness of the CAP in all areas.
We therefore call for fundamental changes that respect the specific characteristics of each country's agriculture and support the maximum linking of aid to production, and for there to be a fairer distribution of direct aid accompanied by a ceiling and modulation.
Incentives should be set for small and medium-sized holdings as instruments of economic and social cohesion and with a view to curbing the intensive approach and supporting associations of such farmers, including agricultural cooperatives and wine cooperatives.
We are also in favour of setting up a public farmers' insurance fund financed by the Community which would enable farmers to be paid a minimum income in the event of natural disasters such as drought, storms, hail, fire, epizootic diseases, etc. We also stress the need for the European Commission to take account, in the context of the World Trade Organization negotiations, of the specific characteristics of agricultural production as a food production sector, and a structuring element for territorial balance, preservation of the environment and the safeguarding of adequate quantitative and qualitative levels of food safety.
Finally, we call on the Commission and the Member States to take the necessary measures to prevent speculative activity, capturing of the market in food products and the formation of cartels by food companies exploiting the lack of legislation or controls, producers' and consumers' lack of organisation, and the lack of suitable infrastructures, with the sole aim of boosting profits, reducing producer prices and imposing high prices on consumers, as happens now, particularly in Portugal, for basic products such as cereals, potatoes for human consumption, and milk.
Mr President, for many years now, despite its underlying principles, the common agricultural policy has been giving more support to rich farmers to the detriment of poor farmers.
The freezing of the agricultural budget in 2002 and the subsequent reforms of the CAP did not improve that situation.
On the contrary - the huge differentiation in the funding provided to farmers became yet greater.
For example, the total subsidies per hectare varied in 2005 between EUR 68 in Latvia and EUR 756 in Belgium, in other words a tenfold increase.
Unjustified differences in agricultural funding are also borne out by the proportion of direct payments, which is now some 70% of all subsidies provided for agriculture.
In its Communication, the European Commission proposed a partial reduction in payments to beneficiaries receiving more than EUR 100 000 a year.
These amount to just 0.34% in the EU, but include megabusinesses, food concerns and golf course owners.
Paradoxically, this timid proposal, which infringes on the interests of such a narrow group of people, was thrown out by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Many motions have been accepted, but they have not done away with the errors in agricultural policy.
The only amendment that offers an opportunity for a fairer split in subsidies is Amendment 19 tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, which is in line with the European Commission's proposal.
I do not suppose, however, that it will find many adherents.
Naturally the amendments that I and my colleague Mr Wojciechowski submitted, which are aimed at a radical alteration of the CAP, were also rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The vote on Mr Goepel's report will be an expression of your responsibility for the shape of agricultural policy for the next few years.
If you are in favour of the sustainable development of EU agriculture and protection of the interests of family farms rather than protection of the interests of a narrow group of business people, you should reject this report, otherwise you will be supporting the further depopulation of rural areas, high unemployment, loss of EU food supply security, discrimination against the new Member States and processes that constitute a threat to the natural environment.
By accepting this report you are violating the main aims of the European Union which are so often forgotten, namely: economic cohesion, social cohesion and solidarity between Member States.
(The President cut off the speaker).
(SK) I very much appreciate the work of the rapporteur, Mr Goepel.
The drafting of the report was particularly difficult in part due to the absence in the background documents analysing possible solutions, relevant case studies and vital data.
The Commission proposes reductions in direct payments to large agricultural holdings, stating that such companies do not require similar assistance.
Figures, however, show otherwise.
In the Slovak Republic, my home country, most agricultural firms fall into the category of large enterprises.
More than 75% of their machinery is over 20 years old: hence the urgent need to provide these companies with financial assistance.
The example of Eastern Germany shows that where these companies received adequate investment, they joined the ranks of the some of the best operating companies in the world.
In the post-socialist countries, on the other hand, these companies were at an administrative disadvantage, resulting in the large-scale destruction not only of agricultural sectors, but also rural areas and entire regions.
The Commission meanwhile has not responded adequately to a highly dangerous increase in the volatility of the global agrifood market.
We must be aware that a repetition of last year could have real adverse effects on food security within the EU.
Doing away with the natural instability of the agricultural market is surely the most important task of any agricultural policy and as such it should also be reflected in this report.
I cannot therefore agree with the existing situation characterised by chaotic measures implemented every year, such as the change in energy crop premiums, elimination of set-aside, production quotas changes, etc.
Speaking of examining the common agricultural...
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his outstanding work.
It also appears that the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development came to 82%, even with the 17 major compromises it has created.
The reforms in 2003/2004 were important stages in the CAP reform process.
An exhaustive check of the CAP, which does not involve any fundamental reform of the existing policy, however, is another important step towards securing a modern, multifunctional and competitive common European agricultural policy.
It has been scientifically documented that good agricultural practice is the basis of this, regardless of whether large or small enterprises are involved.
The first priority is still food production, the second priority animal feed production and the third priority the supply of energy.
As regards the environmental relevance of biomass energy, it can be said that Austrian agriculture, for example, has reduced CO2 output by 14% since 1990 and has therefore actually reached the Kyoto target.
I also welcome the abolition of degressivity.
The model of progressive modulation is the right path and I also support the figures here.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for her statements on milk.
I should therefore like to say on this that we need not only a soft landing and a gentle transition towards 2015, but also sustainable solutions after 2015.
For mountainous regions and disadvantaged and peripheral regions, we have to ensure that a form of agriculture involving dry-feed livestock units is able to exist beyond 2015.
I therefore eagerly await the Commission's legislative proposal on 20 May, Commissioner, and I hope that we rediscover a great deal therein that the Goepel report now delivers, so that we do not have a repeat of this long discussion...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank Mr Goepel for his work, because it is important for the European Parliament to express its opinion on the general guidelines arising from the CAP 'Health Check'.
Personally, I have serious reservations about full decoupling, which carries high risks of the abandonment of production for stockbreeding and even for certain crops.
I do not share the optimism of some people who believe that the current situation on world markets guarantees a steady and secure future for European agriculture and that we should continue heading for complete liberalisation.
Furthermore, not all agricultural sectors are benefiting equally from price rises, as the particularly serious crisis currently being experienced by European livestock farmers shows.
The total abandonment of any market regulation mechanism would seem to me to be hazardous for our food security and that of the world.
I think we need to make sure that we maintain intervention stocks so that we can react in the event of food shortages and speculation, maintain common market organisations ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Goepel most sincerely on his balanced report.
We should not be penalising emergent, competitive structures in agriculture.
We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have therefore rejected the Commission's proposal on degressivity in this form.
We should not be discriminating according to the size of the business in the case of direct payments, otherwise jobs would be jeopardised on a large scale.
Furthermore, I would argue that a final phasing-out of the milk quota system in 2015 is still right.
In view of rising milk prices on the world's booming agricultural markets and the associated export opportunities, this system no longer appears up to date.
A sensible review of the 2003 reform in this regard must not only offer European farmers dependability and reliability in planning, but also be a further step towards the market-based continuing development of our agricultural system.
(PL) Mr President, what is agriculture in the European Union?
For some it is a thing of great value that needs to be protected, but for others, and sadly there are many in this group, it is ballast that they would like to be rid of.
We read in Mr Goepel's report that agriculture is one of the biggest industries in the EU.
That is good, but it is not enough.
Agriculture is not an industry and it is not just one of many sectors of the economy.
Agriculture is a pillar of food security.
We spend vast sums on the army and the police to guarantee physical security in our states and in our homes.
We pay large sums for energy security - we are seeking energy supplies that are more expensive but secure.
We must also spend large sums on protecting our agriculture, which offers us food security, and it is a shame that not everyone in the EU understands that.
Mr President, I also congratulate our rapporteur on an excellent compromise package before us today.
I would like to draw attention, in particular, to three measures which were our successful amendments, which are to be particularly welcomed.
In paragraph 21 of the report, we recognise that decoupling direct payments has largely been successful, and we are firmly of the view that should be rolled out.
Yes, it has to be done properly and sensitively, but it should be pushed forward.
In paragraphs 37 and 38 we explicitly recognise that set-aside is an anachronism and should be fully swept away, and where there are spin-off environmental benefits, they be properly dealt with under Pillar 2.
In paragraphs 86 to 91 we recognise the importance of niche products for Europe's agriculture internationally.
I could certainly produce a shopping list of quality Scottish products for our Commissioner, so I would be grateful for a few words from her on how she plans to take that forward, with the promotion of a European mark for international quality.
(NL) With this Health Check, the Commission has taken a good - if very modest - step towards a slightly less unfair agricultural policy.
I would urge my fellow Members not to support Mr Goepel's report, as it dilutes the Commission proposals on a number of very important points, and in my view the most important point is the imposition, at long last, of cautious limits on the size of the subsidies it is possible to receive.
It is difficult to explain to the European public why, for example, the Prince of Monaco or large multinationals such as Heineken and NestlÃ© receive hundreds of thousands of euros in income support in the form of agricultural subsidies merely because they own some land, whilst real farmers often struggle to make ends meet.
Income support in agriculture is intended to give farmers a decent existence and not to line the pockets of multinationals and large landowners.
(CS) The reform of the CAP was aimed at making it less cumbersome and more market-oriented.
Taking into account the average size of Czech farms the system proposed in the report is unacceptable.
The outcome for the Czech Republic would be that by the year 2013 it would become one of the states with the largest share (part of the speech could not be heard) transferred within the framework of modulation from the first to the second pillar.
Nearly 40% of direct payments in the Czech Republic would then be subject to degressivity compared with 6.5% for France and a mere 2.5% for Austria.
Czech holdings would, according to the existing proposal, be forced to split up senselessly and actually become less efficient.
Neither this nor a compromise proposal are acceptable to the Czech Republic because they leave us open to discrimination, reducing unjustifiably the competitiveness of Czech farmers.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Goepel, in Berlin - nearly 10 years ago now - Chancellor Schmidt and the French President Jacques Chirac decided to grant a reprieve to farmers until 2013.
With the end of milk quotas, the end of a proper agricultural budget as part of the 2014-2019 financial framework, and the retirement of the majority of producers, not to be replaced, the end of the great CAP was planned for 2013 - it was as simple as that.
Today you are questioning this agreement, and in the name of the 'CAP Health Check' you are accelerating the march towards the elimination of agriculture within the first pillar.
This is nothing new!
By dint of quotas, MGQs, Herod premiums, set-aside, decoupling and grubbing up, MacSharry, Steichen, Fischler had practised this strategy of leaving the monopoly on food production to the southern hemisphere and the Pacific countries for 30 years.
Today, in the gripping technical debates on full decoupling, modulation - whether degressive or progressive - eco-conditionality, rural development, and reference values - whether historical or non-historical - simply hide the only real issue, as China and India are about to launch a call for bids to feed the planet, as the morning comes for farmers when there is a rise in prices and demand.
Does Europe still want to be one of the world's great farms, together with Brazil? Yes or no?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, I am glad to see such a big audience here for this debate, because it is an important one.
If we were to go on the clapometer in relation to large payments to royalty or individual farmers, they would be quaking in their boots in royal houses across Europe.
But it is a more complex debate, as we have heard from our eastern European colleagues.
As regards the health check, can I say very briefly that in relation to decoupling and modulation in Ireland, we have fully decoupled, and I think the Commissioner acknowledges that.
We want to stick with our historic payments system and we do not like increased modulation.
It is robbing Peter to pay Paul, dressed up as something else.
We do not really know where the rural development money will end up and we need to look at that very carefully.
It is not Article 69 that troubles Irish farmers at the moment, but the WTO.
I have in front of me here, and will share with colleagues, the assessment of the latest paper from the WTO.
It is in full colour and it is not pretty.
If Mr Mandelson has his way, then I am afraid that the beef and dairy, lamb and pigmeat sectors in Europe will be wiped out, and so will the common agricultural policy.
The cuts in tariffs range up to 70%.
Now, perhaps people do not understand the impact of that, but it means that our producers will not and cannot compete with imported food products and products that are produced to very, very different standards.
The lamb sector, which Parliament is actually trying to help, will be decimated by the WTO.
Can I ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps take this analysis that the Irish Farmers' Association has completed - and I will raise it again, because it is in full colour - and come back to me and tell me, I hope, that they have got it wrong, although I fear that they have got it right.
There is a complete lack of information for this House on the impact of the latest text from the WTO, and I think we need and deserve to have that information.
I would just like to say that Irish farmers support the European Union, but over the weekend I had many come to my door who are questioning their decisions in relation to voting on various treaties.
And that is serious, as the Commissioner knows.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, European farmers, and Spanish farmers in particular, need, and I would say that they are demanding, a minimum degree of stability.
Therefore, the first thing that I would like to ask the Commission is that this mid-term review of the common agricultural policy should not become a major, radical review.
One aspect that concerns me is the partial decoupling of aid; the haste to move forward in decoupling aid may endanger many crops.
A total or partial level of decoupling in certain sectors is vital for maintaining production, for example in the cotton sector.
Consequently, I think that the decoupling levels should be maintained as agreed in 2003 and in any event, if that is not possible, I think that Member States should be given some room for manoeuvre, as a voluntary model for each sector, on a case-by-case basis, could create the best circumstances for agricultural production.
I think that we should send a message of calm and stability to the agricultural sector at this time.
(NL) My compliments to Mr Goepel on his work.
In my opinion, two things are important in this debate.
Firstly, in my view, the most important aspect of agricultural policy is the common market for 500 million consumers.
Has the Commission or the Goepel report disrupted this market?
I think not - and that is a good thing.
Secondly, I believe that authorities must be trustworthy.
We must stand by what was promised in the 2007 budget, and indeed I think the Commission is doing so.
I have mixed feelings about modulation.
I do not yet know the results of the rural policy.
The reports from the Court of Auditors have been extremely critical, but I have problems with imposing an extra financial burden on farmers, 60% of which they would not see again.
In the Netherlands this is used to buy nature areas.
I should like to say a few words about non-trade concerns.
How can I explain to European farmers that they are not allowed to produce certain products when other countries are, and when we are allowed to import such products without restrictions?
This leads to unfair competition.
(PL) Mr President, in recent years many changes have been made to the common agricultural policy.
Not all of them were dictated by a need to improve the situation in rural areas or by the needs of EU consumers.
At present food prices are constantly rising but, even so, the situation for small and medium-sized enterprises is not significantly improving.
The European Commission does more to support international corporations, including those that produce genetically modified foods, than it does for local farms.
The European Community is moving ever closer to a loss of sovereignty in the area of food production.
Now, under the proposed reforms of the common agricultural policy, there is a further move to do away with another group of farmers, the tobacco growers, which is leading to economic disaster for almost 100 000 such individuals and to the loss of 400 000 jobs.
It is high time for the European Commission to begin caring more for the interests of European farmers than for those in third countries.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, the context of agriculture has changed a great deal since 2003, and the analyses we have today are already out of date and not really up to the crucial challenges of the future.
Demand for food products is exploding, prices are rising fast and becoming unaffordable for those most hard up, and at the same time agricultural land is disappearing.
Biofuels, which are subsidised, are vastly destabilising agriculture.
Let us also underline the impact of climate change, and above all, the fact that our citizens are questioning the intensive, ultra-liberal industrial model, which means that foods travel thousands of kilometres around the world, all of which is accompanied by social and environmental dumping.
An in-depth reform of the common agricultural policy is therefore what we should now be carrying out, and not just a technical adaptation of the current instruments, which is what you are proposing today.
What we also really need now is a bearing, a clear strategic direction, which is what we lack most at the moment.
(GA) Mr President, this Report comes before us at a very important time for farmers in the EU.
As my colleague, Ms McGuinness has already said - we saw at the World Trade Organisation talks how the Commissioner is willing to sacrifice the interests of our farmers and our rural community not for the good of the third world, but for part of an international bargaining game.
In terms of the health check, I agree that there must be a balance between simplifying matters and making them more effective and giving farmers some sort of stability as they produce food for us and maintain the countryside.
If it is implemented fairly, we should welcome a limit to large payments to large-scale farmers or to large companies as a step forward from the Common Agricultural Policy which only helps big landowners.
It is also important that only active farmers are included in payment entitlements.
The Common Agricultural Policy should ...
(The President interrupted the Speaker)
Mr President, any health check needs measurement and assessment.
For the CAP, I suggest that the measure is funding and that the assessors are the auditors.
Does the Court of Auditors find the CAP to be healthy, when 28.9% of single farm payments are erroneous?
Does it find it healthy for the CAP to fund farmers not to grow food?
Does it find it healthy to turn farmland over to biofuels, just when there is a world shortage of cereals?
Does it find the CAP healthy when genuine farmers - in the UK at least - are struggling to make a living?
Does it know that farmers in New Zealand are not now subsidised but are doing very well and that only 3% of them went under when subsidies were withdrawn?
Since it sounds to me that the CAP is very unhealthy, is it not time to turn off the life-support machine and let European farmers make their own way?
Mr President, there is much in this report that I agree with.
There are four quick points I would like to make.
Firstly, the theory of decoupling is very good but its practice has been disappointing for some in failing to command the higher market returns for producers that were promised.
Secondly, we must sustain sufficient instruments to safeguard against market and supply crises.
Imbalances in the supply chain endanger the CAP's aim of secure food supply.
Food security is impossible without guaranteed economic sustainability for producers.
Thirdly, we can do more on CAP simplification to reduce the bureaucratic burden and, yes, to decriminalise farmers who make honest mistakes through minor breaches.
Fourthly, unused agri-budget allocations on market management measures should be available for Article 69 aid to strengthen EU agriculture, particularly where production is marginal and to deal with situations, as in my constituency, where there are high numbers of farmers over 55 years of age with no prospect of alternative employment.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Goepel report offers a good compromise between the Commission's daring proposals and the concerns expressed by our farmers.
Well done, Mr Goepel, for providing us with this report; it was not easy, we know.
Some good proposals have come out of it.
This is the case firstly with the system of direct aid that needs to be modified, bearing in mind that the Member States must have greater flexibility to implement this change.
If it has to go ahead, decoupling should take account of the difficulties certain sectors are currently experiencing, particularly the livestock sector and some areas of crop production that are very important for many regions, such as flax and hemp fodder, which should benefit from a suitable transition period.
The way it is proposed, modulation seems too great and makes the first pillar unbalanced.
The measures associated with set-aside must be able to be reformed, but the Commission should first clearly define instruments that enable the benefits it brings to be protected, particularly as regards biodiversity.
The revision and strengthening of Article 69 would also be a way of providing effective financial support for weakened areas, such as mountainous regions, for restructuring sectors in difficulty, such as stockbreeding and milk, or for managing risks.
Finally, Commissioner, we should really ask ourselves about biofuels, which are strongly disputed from an environmental point of view.
Perhaps the health check is the perfect opportunity to do this.
(HU) The report we are debating is one of the most important reports on the agricultural sector in the past four years, since it is much more than just an appraisal of the current state of affairs, or a 'health check'.
Mrs Fischer Boel is a liberal-radical, Mr Goepel a Christian democrat-liberal, while I am a socialist-liberal, and we have the job of reforming the common agricultural policy fundamentally from 2014.
This 'health check' puts into words a number of ideas that will come into effect from 2014.
One example is the move to an area-based flat-rate for direct payments, another is redeployment of financing to the second pillar and the type of modulation envisaged for this; yet another is the need to develop a risk management system.
I agree with Mrs Fischer Boel and Mr Goepel that the ceilings are also very important.
I would be happy to see the British queen getting less; in Hungary too there are a great many large-scale holdings at present.
We must, however, devise a system that prevents circumvention of the ceiling limit; in other words, we will have to resolve this issue in the future.
Thank you very much.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to point out four dimensions in which the CAP should evolve.
The maintenance of direct aid, which is an essential element: it has been proven that no economy in the world lets its farmers make a decent living without financial support.
The environment, which shapes agriculture as much as agriculture shapes the environment.
It is therefore important to maintain the conditionality criteria for obtaining aid.
Any agreement in the WTO should deal with the issue of protected geographical indications, animal wellbeing and the state of health of imported products, for reasons of fair competition and because health problems do not stop at borders.
Finally, it is necessary to define agriculture's contribution to climate change and sustainable development.
I invite the European Commission to examine more closely the question of how much arable land in the European Union can be turned over to biofuels and green chemicals.
I welcome this resolution, which is a good reflection of the future challenges for agriculture, both in terms of producing food and in terms of protecting our environment.
Mr President, I welcome the proposal to simplify the regulatory burden for farmers in the context of the CAP health check and I would urge the Commissioner to give farmers advance notice of cross-compliance inspections when she is examining how to simplify regulations and make them more flexible.
I am totally opposed to the increasing of compulsory modulation to 13% over the next few years.
This would reduce the direct payment to farmers who have already budgeted for this money.
There is danger that sheep farming's vital role in preserving sensitive environmental and ecological areas will be eroded through land abandonment and that husbandry skills would be lost, and this must be addressed and supported in the CAP health check.
It is now clear from the last debate that milk quotas will be abolished from April 2015 and I welcome the Commissioner's contribution to this debate.
It is important that there is a soft landing and I would support an annual increase in milk quotas up to 2015.
Finally, proposals on the table in Geneva regarding the future of EU agriculture in the context of the WTO are totally unacceptable, particularly from an Irish viewpoint.
I welcome the fact that many other EU Member States are also opposed to these proposals and that the Commissioner responsible will take account of these concerns.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to start by first of all congratulating Mr Goepel on his work and saying that I am going to concentrate on talking about the future of the dairy sector.
I would like to make the following comments.
First of all I would like to say that there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding what the impact could be of eliminating the quota system in the various producing regions.
Many people fear that the trend of abandoning production will accelerate and that it will be an irreversible blow to some areas with a very low level of profitability and few alternatives for agriculture.
It is clear, however, that the current system of quotas is not having the desired result, which is achieving a balance between production and consumption.
We have gone from having milk lakes to having a deficit of more than 3 million tonnes, which is strong evidence of the ups and downs of this COM, the uneven distribution of production quotas, poor and meagre evaluation of the latest reforms and of some of the specific measures applied, such as decoupling aid, the impact of which on the future of the sector we do not know.
In addition to all of this there are the disparities that exist in the application of the quota system between some countries and others; and, Commissioner, I have to say that in some countries, such as mine, there are obstacles to the liberalisation of the sector, and that for example the individual transfer of quotas, a fundamental element for restructuring, has been banned since 2005.
Finally, Commissioner, I would simply like to say that I think it would be positive to combine the idea of increasing quotas by 2% on a voluntary basis for 2008-2009, as proposed by the Jeggle and Goepel reports, with a non-linear increase for subsequent years, as requested in paragraph 84 of the Goepel report, in order to distribute the production quotas in a more balanced way, giving priority to Member States that have traditionally been in deficit in relation to their internal consumption.
(NL) I should like to draw attention to an aspect of our agricultural policy that is often neglected: the interests of developing countries.
We must move away from protectionism and the market-distorting measures that are built into the current system.
The very poorest countries have the right to fair access to our market and the stopping of unfair competition on their markets.
I have tabled amendments calling attention to this, and I should like to ask my fellow Members to support them.
The Commissioner will agree with me that, in addition, our policy should focus first and foremost on the consumer.
Therefore, it is vital that we support farmers in the production of sufficient safe food of the very highest quality.
Hence we must ensure sustainable agriculture, in which the maximum investment is made in protecting and improving rural areas and the environment, so that not only we, but also our children, can take pleasure in them.
We must ensure sufficient food for all, and one way of doing so is to increasingly develop our knowledge and to share our knowledge and modern technologies with the rest of the world.
(FI) Mr President, the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on a health check for agriculture is a realistic one.
The biggest problem is decoupling.
The Commission is calling for increased decoupling of aid from production.
The Committee is being very wary, and not without reason.
Decoupling in many ways is like farmers' early retirement aid.
It favours farms which decrease or abandon production but does not motivate young farmers who are expanding their production.
In the same way it favours extensive production to the detriment of labour-intensive production.
In particular, the areas which are worse off in terms of their natural conditions seem to be losing out.
For example, in the United States aid is still mainly tied to production.
It is most annoying that the social justification for aid is losing ground.
If a farmer who produces food part-time receives the same payment as another who works seven days a week, the taxpayer might well protest.
The job of farming will continue to be to produce food.
(PL) Mr President, despite having been reformed several times, the common agricultural policy is still not living up to expectations.
The European Union's loss of food security, the numerous crisis situations and the lack of common settlements that satisfy both sides are egregious examples of this.
The crisis situation is being enhanced by the lack of cohesion and the discrimination against farmers in the new Member States.
The fact that there are better and worse situations, depending on geographical location and the date of accession to the European Union, really demonstrates that there is no common agricultural policy and that there will not be one for some considerable time to come.
Despite the enormous amount of work that the rapporteur, Mr Goepel, has put in, the aim has not been achieved and it is not even easy to say whether we are nearer to or further away from sensible solutions.
In view of this situation, the opinion of the minority, according to which the Commission is continuing to operate a policy of support for international food industry corporations and big landowners, and that the common agricultural policy fails to meet the needs of consumers or of small and medium-sized family farms that are being forced to cease production, seems to be correct.
Therefore, we need a new, fair agricultural policy drawn up by objective experts rather than interest groups.
(BG) Mr. Chairman, Mme Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Lutz Goepel for the successful work on this report.
In my capacity of a MEP from Bulgaria, I find it particularly important that the report pays special attention to the new Member States of the European Union.
They can, if they are willing to do so, apply a simplified single payment per unit of area until 2013 and they will be supported by the European Union in the application of the cross-compliance rules.
The preservation of the Member States' right to decide on their own whether and how to change their direct aid systems will provide our countries with greater flexibility and help them adjust to the specific needs of each region and each sector.
I believe that the report on the health check of the Common Agricultural Policy is of special importance today, when the European Parliament has to show to the citizens its commitment and responsible political attitude to the development of the agricultural sector in the Community.
I think that the report of Lutz Goepel protects the interests of the European farmers and I urge you to support it.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating my fellow Member Mr Goepel on a fine report and by thanking him for the enormous amount of work he has invested in it.
The report fully reflects Parliament's particular interest in the issue of agricultural policy.
Even though expenditure in the current budget perspective amounts to only 33%, compared to 80% in the 1970s, agricultural policy continues to be, and should be, one of the most important European policies.
Since my time is limited, I shall mention just a few matters that are of importance to the new Member States.
The introduction of modulation in the new Member States should not be accepted until full payments have been obtained and should be done gradually, as it was in other countries of the Fifteen.
I cannot agree with removal of the subsidies and energy supplements that we have only just been awarded.
Quite the contrary, the EU should particularly support the new direction of biomass production.
As regards the future of milk quotas, I am holding to my belief that the decision to be taken on this requires a broader debate and much more profound analysis.
(RO) In my capacity as vice-president of ENVI, I would like to make several remarks concerning the impact of climate change on agriculture.
The practice of intensive agriculture over the last years has made the farmers contribute, to a large extent, to global warming, and now they are facing its devastating effects.
Statistics estimate that agriculture is responsible for 17% to 32% of greenhouse gas emissions produced by human activities.
Agriculture is still polluting as a consequence of irrational use of fertilisers, inadequate storage of animal manure, and irrational use of land, and I am referring especially to deforestation and overgrazing.
Global warming is irreversible and the frequent occurrence of droughts or flooding in the future should no longer surprise us.
That is why I support the idea presented in the report concerning the creation of a security network at European level to help EU farmers in case of ecological, climatic or epidemiological calamities.
Consequently, I ask the European Commission to analyse the possibility of urgent establishment of an insurance fund or mechanism for multiple risks concerning EU farmers, financed from the EU budget as well as from the budgets of the Member States.
(PL) Mr President, there are just two issues in this debate to which I should like to draw attention.
Firstly, the percentage of the total budget expenditure spent on agriculture is steadily falling and will be only 32% in the last year of this budget perspective.
These funds constitute around 30% of EU farmers' income on average.
This level of support needs to be maintained in the future in order to sustain interest in agricultural activities, and above all to ensure Europe's food security.
We should bear in mind that many of the world's developed countries deploy a variety of instruments to support farming income at a level of over 50%.
These countries include Japan, South Korea, Norway and Switzerland.
Secondly, a much more rapid evening out of support for farmers in old and new Member States is needed.
Experts calculate that the average level of support per hectare of farmland in 2007-2013 in the new Member States will be barely 62-64% of that received by farmers in the old Member States.
Unless these two basic postulates are met, it will be difficult to conceive of development in European farming.
(PL) Mr President, the aim of this review of EU agricultural policy is to improve it, in the light of experience gained in the period that has elapsed since the last reform in 2003 and the situation that has arisen in the world market.
It should be remembered, however, that the changes being made must not undermine, firstly, the community nature of this policy - we are against its nationalisation - and secondly, the European agricultural model.
There are no grounds for basing direct subsidies on historic production levels and having them differentiated in this way.
The future model for subsidies after 2013 should be based on simple principles similar to the SAPS.
However, market intervention in extreme cases should also be allowed, or even production subsidies, as in the case of tobacco or milk production in mountain areas.
- (EL) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Goepel on his report.
Since time is very limited, let me emphasise certain principles that must guide any reform of the common agricultural policy, with the aid of either a communication or a legislative instrument.
Firstly, the redefinition of the European agricultural model cannot neglect family-based small and medium-sized enterprises.
Secondly, the issue of funding, which will need to be settled later, must not be based on the principle of co-financing, which in effect renationalises the common agricultural policy.
Thirdly, the question of regionalisation, which cannot by itself resolve the issues of the market and food products, will need to be re-examined and seen in its true dimensions.
Fourthly, unfairness arising from certain reforms, such as that of tobacco, will have to be eliminated.
These products must be reinstated and treated in the same way as others.
(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very important report in view of the complexity and vast scope of the subject being dealt with.
I would like to underline two points that I think are particularly important.
The first is that I consider the CAP an important instrument that should be maintained even after 2013, because it supports enterprise.
However, for this reason it should be directed at entrepreneurs, so they can create jobs, maintain the environment and guarantee high quality products.
The second concerns the delicate issue of milk quotas.
I do in fact agree with the rapporteur on the need to protect those regions of Europe where there is no alternative to livestock farming and milk production, but we should not forget those farmers who have invested heavily in order to acquire milk quotas and who, from 2015, could find themselves in great financial difficulties.
I hope that, with the help of the Commissioner, we can find a solution that suits everyone, partly because in 1984, when the quota system was set up, Italy was against it and today still has a production deficit of about 40% of the milk it consumes.
Mr President, Mr Goepel's excellent report will lay the foundations for a sound agricultural policy for the future, but there is growing evidence that food security is going to rise to the top of our political agenda, as Mr Parish said.
Such is the panic caused by climate change that politicians and planners are in danger of creating a bigger global problem than they set out to resolve.
The rush to biofuels is taking so much land out of agricultural production that some experts are now predicting imminent global famine.
Likewise, vast tracts of the Amazonian and Indonesian rainforests are being torn up to make way for biofuel crops like palm oil and for food crops like soya, releasing millions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere and threatening to destroy our global air conditioning system.
Deforestation now accounts for around 18% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions and highlights the insanity of current policies.
Greed, instead of care for the environment, has become the defining feature of our strategy for tackling climate change, and the race to biofuels is potentially threatening the lives of millions of people, as the global population soars from its present six billion to an estimated nine billion by 2050.
An extra six million people are born every month.
By 2030, the world population will have expanded by such an extent that we will require a 50% increase in food production to meet anticipated demand.
By 2080, global food production would need to double!
But the reality is that an area the size of Ukraine is being taken out of agricultural food production every year due to drought and as a direct consequence of climate change.
Global food production is in decline rather than expanding.
That is why food security is now top of the agenda.
(RO) The common agricultural policy is one of the pillars of European development and the debates on the methods of improvement of this policy should be a constant, not only for the European institutions, but also within the Member States in the communities that elected us.
I am glad that by means of the Commission Communication and the report drafted by my colleague Goepel we have identified several solutions to enhance the common agricultural policy and to make the people in rural areas believe that this policy is for their own good and not only a set of bureaucratic provisions drafted by some offices in Brussels.
However, we must be sure that the proposals made by the Commission, the Council and us are flexible and realistic enough to be efficient when implemented.
Romania, the country that I represent in the European Parliament, accounts for 25% of the work force in agriculture and 40% of its population lives in the rural areas.
These are figures which demonstrate the importance of agriculture and rural areas for Romania and our economy.
The solutions that we find for the CAP reform must take account of such cases as Romania, with a large agricultural sector in a full process of modernisation.
Mr President, I would like, first of all, to welcome the report by Mr Goepel and thank him for his hard work and that of all the people involved in this.
This is only the beginning of the process as we look to the future of the common agricultural policy during this year.
This is a very important step in this process and we now look forward to the Commission proposals in the near future.
The position of the second pillar of rural development and what level of modulation is set will certainly be central, I believe, to the long-term success or otherwise of the future of the common agricultural policy.
But I have to say that never has it been more important to ensure a level playing field throughout the Member States, and we cannot allow different levels of percentages among the Member States.
Decoupling has, to a large extent, been successful.
I do not think we can go back on that.
Cross-compliance has been unhelpful and bureaucratic and can be improved.
And food security must be at the top of the list.
(PL) Mr President, solutions to increasingly serious problems are being demanded of the common agricultural policy and the structural policy that supports it.
The fundamental shape of the common agricultural policy for the years 2007-2013 that was adopted by the ministers of agriculture of the EU countries on 26 June 2003 in Luxembourg includes some solutions that benefit Poland.
Others, however, do more to protect the interests of the old Member States.
I share the rapporteur's view that the Commission should draw up a detailed report relating to such problems as the additional costs borne by farmers in respect of observance of Community norms in the sphere of environmental protection, animal welfare and food security.
In taking a position on the report that has been presented to us, I agree that it is necessary to continue the process of reforms and further development of rural areas.
The common agricultural policy must change if it is to find answers to new challenges such as climate change, increasing energy demands, world population increases and the increasing degree of openness to world markets.
(DE) Mr President, I welcome the Goepel report because the time is finally ripe for abolishing or thoroughly reforming instruments such as quota control, livestock premiums, export refunds and intervention prices.
Looking at the global increase in demand for foodstuffs, a greater market economy in agricultural policy also offers more opportunities in European agriculture.
I am anxious about the wording of some of the compromises.
The talk here is of headage premiums being decoupled for now, sector-related systems of protection are being demanded and a whole series of derogations - on milk, for instance - are to be funded via the first pillar.
This all runs the risk of us hanging on to the old market regulations via the back door.
We must really limit exceptions to structurally weak regions and define them for very tightly limited production quantities.
If we are too generous here it will lead to distortions of competition that we are not able to calculate in political terms.
I therefore encourage the Commission to give the market a proper chance in the upcoming legislative proposals.
Mr President, there are a number of references in this report to the WTO.
However, I have real concerns that, while we debate this report on the CAP in Parliament this afternoon, the future of European agriculture is being threatened and seriously undermined by the negotiations being undertaken in our name by Commissioner Mandelson at the WTO talks.
The report calls for the concept of qualified market access to be pursued in WTO negotiations.
Is Commissioner Fischer Boel satisfied that we are pursuing that line?
Indeed, is Commissioner Fischer Boel confident that the line being taken by Commissioner Mandelson will not undermine the beef, dairy and other sectors and, in some ways at least, render our debate here this afternoon irrelevant?
The report calls for European non-trade concerns to be central in WTO talks.
Is the Commissioner satisfied we are pursuing that line, or are we just having a very polite debate in Parliament this afternoon, while Mr Mandelson is attacking the very foundations of the CAP?
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to thank you all for a very interesting debate.
In my opinion the report was also of very high quality and full of good ideas.
I would like to say that in many issues in this debate Parliament and the Council expressed very similar opinions, which are too numerous to list here.
I am convinced that this similarity will give these opinions additional weight and that it offers a good basis for future cooperation between the two institutions.
I am also sure that it will be reflected in the conclusions that ministers are to debate and adopt next week.
I am convinced that both institutions will closely study the legislative proposals which the Commission is to present at the informal session in Slovenia in May, and that we will have an interesting debate at that session.
Finally, I would like to say that the Slovenian Presidency will strive for a speedy start to the debate on these proposals in order to finish most of the work during the Slovenian Presidency.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I completely agree with Mr Nicholson that this is the first step in a discussion that is going to continue for almost the rest of this year and, therefore, I shall not go into detail on all the various questions that have been raised here today.
I shall just pinpoint a few of the more important ones.
First of all, a huge majority is in favour of the idea of more decoupling, and I am very appreciative of this idea.
The idea of giving a Member State the possibility to introduce a regional model is a chance for them to go further towards a flat rate and I have explained on various occasions why I think this is important.
In order not to raise any expectations, I will be very direct and very frank on tobacco decoupling.
It was decided in the reform of 2004 to decouple tobacco payments.
As we are now trying to go even further in decoupling, the idea that some of you raised of extending the coupled payment for tobacco would be a step in totally the wrong direction.
Therefore, do not have any expectations that the Commission will move in that direction.
Ms McGuinness said that modulation was like robbing farmers.
I do not agree with this approach.
I think the rural development policy will need more money in order to meet the new challenges - climate change and the reduction of CO2 emissions will be the most important ones.
We have to take into account, firstly, that the decoupled money will stay in the Member States and, secondly, that modulated money is co-financed by Member States and therefore you actually steer the money.
You get twice as much as you deduct from the direct payment.
This is an important message and we will come back to this in the legislative proposals.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf mentioned progressive modulation and the necessity, from his point of view, to include labour intensity in these discussions.
I understand his point of view, but I can only say that this will be extremely bureaucratic and very, very difficult to manage, so I am very reluctant to enter into this discussion.
I might be wrong, but, personally, I do not consider the introduction of codecision on agriculture a threat, as I heard suggested.
I consider this a huge and natural step in a situation where the agricultural sector is so important, both from an economic point of view and because this is important for quite a lot of people.
Therefore, I welcome this change, but, on the other hand, it is important that we finalise this health check before the end of the year, otherwise it will be a Health Check for 2010 and then we are too close to 2013.
That is the reason why, but, believe me, I am very happy with the changes that have been mentioned.
Concerning developing countries, the European Union is the most open market for developing countries: we import more agricultural products than Canada, the United States, Australia and Japan put together.
This has to be taken into account when we talk about the agricultural sector.
I should like to say to Ms Harkin that I have been informed that she has tabled an oral question.
This will be answered in writing and, therefore, I am quite sure she will get all the information she has been asking for.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, with this discussion the sport of figure skating comes to mind.
When judging figure skating, we discard the highest and lowest marks and then award the score.
If I therefore remove the far right and far left views in this House, we shall then have a result with which we are all very satisfied and with which we can all live very happily.
Thank you very much for your support and cooperation.
I would emphasise this once again beyond the limits of the groups.
I am looking forward to what will be exciting cooperation on the legislative package.
I would only add, Mr Goepel, that the same principle of trimming off the highest and lowest marks also applies in ski-jumping and boxing.
If this enlarges our debate, then all well and good.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday 12 March 2008.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - Of course it is of the utmost importance to clearly stress in the framework of this report the necessity to maintain direct payments not only in the case of climate-related crisis or market failures but also to balance fairly the high European standards in terms of environmental, animal and consumer protection.
Nevertheless, it is our duty to consider seriously the situation of the least-developed agricultural producing countries while reviewing the criteria under which direct payments will be made in the future under our common agricultural policy.
Moreover, we have to acknowledge the difficult situation faced by most of the new Member States' agricultural sectors requiring specific attention and further investments mainly in restructuring and modernisation of the sector.
Finally, I would like to point out that it is essential while addressing the CAP health check that the emphasis should - following the recent crises - be on guaranteeing food safety and supply for our citizens by ensuring sufficient food-stocks.
Follow-up after the review of the "Lamfalussy Process" (debate)
The next item is the debate on
an oral question by Pervenche BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Council: Follow-up after the review of the Lamfalussy process - B6-0011/2008)
an oral question by Pervenche BerÃšs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to the Commission: Follow-up after the review of the Lamfalussy process - B6-0012/2008)
author. - (FR) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much, Commissioner, for being here. However, we were expecting Commissioner McCreevy - as I am sure you know or suspect.
You can tell him that Parliament does not really understand why he is not here today at this debate.
I have heard that he thought it was bad form to debate these issues with the European Parliament before discussing them in the European Council, or before the European Council had discussed them.
Yet this subject was on the Ecofin Council agenda and, all over Brussels, and perhaps in other European capitals, the draft conclusions are circulating.
Here in plenary, we will be having a debate tomorrow to prepare for this European Council, so why, when it comes to financial markets, can we not prepare these questions with the European Parliament too?
This is something we do not understand, unless the Commissioner is currently campaigning in Ireland for the Treaty of Lisbon, but if he is, he could at least tell us.
If he is preparing his future, we are interested in that too.
In any case, if Commissioner McCreevy wants to advocate transparency in financial markets, I think he ought to start by being transparent about his own diary!
Financial innovation is an important issue.
I also think that, in this Parliament, it is time we acted on the need for regulation.
We are often told: if you regulate the financial markets, capital will leave the European market.
Today, as my American colleague says, I think the only thing we are seeing is not the disappearance of capital, but the disappearance of the consequences of subprimes.
When we approach this debate, we want to do so with three things in mind: obviously functioning financial markets, but also a genuine capacity to finance the economy and an ability to anticipate the needs of financial markets for stability and protection against the systemic risks.
It is in this spirit that we are tackling preparations today for the European Council, with the idea that European monetary policy probably reacted well at the start of the crisis, but that today, in a way, the European supervisor has been found out - and that is what bothers us.
When we look at the issues that will be discussed in the next European Council, we wonder: how capable are we really, at European level, of anticipating a crisis?
People talk about an early warning system, but what we see is that, in the markets, the people who really have the ability to raise the alarm are called Goldman Sachs.
Are we therefore going to learn any lessons from this for the way Europe operates?
I hear a lot of talk everywhere about transparency.
We are all in favour of transparency, but what of that call for transparency when, for the last eight months, all the large investment banks have been called upon to give their figures, to give their assessment of their exposure to risk?
They cannot do it, because behind it lies a challenge in terms of reputation, and undoubtedly in terms of valuation, a challenge that is extremely difficult to deal with.
Therefore, when I hear people talking about an alternative, the early warning system - I have already said something about this ...
As one IMF councillor said to me the other day, the early warning system is a bit like when it says: 'Smoking kills' on a packet of cigarettes.
How much does it change your behaviour?
Not a great deal.
Of course, the IMF and the Financial Stability Forum have a role to play in this.
Who does not know this?
However, it should be an alternative to our ability to watch how our systems are working.
I should say, on this point, that the surprises for this Parliament are just getting bigger. When we adopted the Ehler report on deposit-guarantee schemes on 13 December, we were told that it was much too complex a business and, anyway, it would not provide any guarantees for how the systems would function.
It seems today from the main conclusions of the Ecofin Council to be a way of escaping the crisis, or in any case, a matter that should be reopened as a matter of urgency.
If you do reopen it, Commissioner, or rather if your colleague Commissioner McCreevy reopens it, we will be next in line to examine it.
At some point, you perhaps need to listen more carefully to what Parliament says about issues like this one.
Similarly, as regards the credit-rating agencies, we can only refer you - or refer Commissioner McCreevy - back to what we said before.
We know that the Commission wants to present proposals for the amendment of the Capital Requirements Directive, or CRD.
We will be examining these proposals carefully, but we do not think that this will be enough to give the European Union the system of supervision it needs, unless we take account of all the proposals that have been on the table for some months now.
This also concerns the situation of the supervisory committees - the three 'Level 3' committees, as we usually call them.
For these three Level 3 committees, we need a proposal for legislation that gives them a solid legal basis to act and to strengthen their capability, including in dialogue with the other supervisory authorities, because the idea that we are going to bring in the other supervisory authorities without having our own solid system of supervision does not seem very satisfactory to us.
We would like the Council and the Commission together to look at the proposals on the table, not forgetting, of course, the proposals that the Italian Finance Minister, Mr Padoa-Schioppa, made at the Ecofin Council in December.
In the same spirit, here too, we would also like to think more proactively about improving our regulation system, out of respect for the principle of subsidiarity.
We do not believe the idea of a lead supervisor would satisfy all the Member States.
What Parliament should be asking for is a solution that includes all the Member States and that enables each one to feel comfortable with the supervision system.
On all these matters, I would be grateful if you, President-in-Office, and you, Commissioner, would make your comments, bearing in mind that I am obviously merely expressing questions that are being asked in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, since we have not yet deliberated on a proper report.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to emphasise the Council's opinion, which is that the key response to the current situation in the financial market is consistent implementation of the three working programmes already adopted by the Council during the Portuguese Presidency.
As you may recall, last October the ECOFIN Council adopted a report and a set of decisions, as mentioned in the oral question by Mrs BerÃšs.
A schedule is attached to those decisions.
I would like to make a brief remark regarding the principles that guide our efforts.
The first guideline concerns the procedures and principles for improving cooperation and conduct in international financial crises.
One of the key aims in this area is to finalise and sign the new memorandum of understanding which will define common principles and guidelines for strengthening cooperation in the field of crisis management.
The Presidency expects the memorandum to be finalised during the informal session of the ECOFIN Council that is to take place in Slovenia next month.
The other main guideline for the work in strengthening measures for financial stability concerns the tools for preventing, managing and resolving crises.
The October schedule deals with all the recognised deficiencies, especially the regulations on state aid, the system of guaranteed deposits, the rules on winding-up procedures, and the limitations concerning the transfer of funds, all on an international scale.
I would like briefly to touch on the decisions reached following the review of the Lamfalussy process, adopted at the December session of the ECOFIN Council, and the attached schedule.
Although in some respects this matter relates to the efforts to achieve financial stability, the long-term issues associated with the supervision of international financial groups do not have much to do with the current market situation.
They mainly concern the national supervisors, who are required to adjust to the conditions of continuously developing financial markets.
I wish to stress the Council's opinion that we need to increase the convergence of supervision in order to ensure equal competition.
Here we are mainly concerned with the convergence of supervisory practice and not necessarily with the convergence of supervisory institutions.
As regards the response of the economic policy players to the current situation in the financial markets, let me express the Council's conviction that the primary responsibility for correction rests with the individual sector.
We should resort to legislative initiatives only if the sector proves incapable of adopting efficient measures.
The ECOFIN Council debated the question of financial stability at its last session on 4 March.
At the end of this week the European Council will address this problem and, I hope, will agree with the progress achieved.
The ECOFIN Council will continue to follow the situation closely.
I have already mentioned the April session of the ECOFIN Council to be held informally in Slovenia.
We will of course be pleased to hear proposals from the European Parliament as well.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the oral question tabled by Ms BerÃšs on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gives me, on behalf of Mr McCreevy and on behalf of the whole Commission, the opportunity to inform you of the ongoing work on the review of the Lamfalussy process.
Throughout last year, the European supervisory model in the field of financial services was examined at the highest political level.
These discussions showed that there is a strong political will to strengthen the current supervisory architecture based on the Lamfalussy committee structure.
Last year we saw the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission each submit their assessment of the functioning of the current process.
It is now time to move forward and to present concrete proposals.
This stems from the Ecofin Council's conclusions and the accompanying road map which were adopted last December.
This road map sets out what needs to be done to improve the Lamfalussy process and in particular to improve the committees of national supervisory authorities, the so-called 'level three' committees.
The Commission's work is centred on three main areas following this agreement of the road map adopted last December.
First, the Commission was requested to consider how to clarify and strengthen the role of the level three committees and to set out concrete options for the informal Ecofin Council next April in Ljubljana.
The main objective here is to bring forth the contribution that the level three committee should make to supervisory cooperation, supervisory convergence and possibly to crisis prevention and management.
The informal Ecofin, by the way, will also discuss the work of a taskforce focusing on crisis management on cross border institutions.
Second, work is ongoing by a working group of the Commission to review supervisory powers, voluntary delegation of tasks, supervisory cooperation and exchange of information.
We are working together with the three level three committees on these tasks to deliver the requested results before the end of the year.
Considering the enormous scope of these reviews, it is, however, still too early to indicate today what the outcome of this work will be.
Third, the Commission is looking into the possibility of financially contributing to the activities of the level three committees.
This is an urgent problem as these committees in general, and in particular the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), have reached their budgetary limits.
The Commission will be looking for a stable legislative solution which would ensure continuity in EU financing.
In our view, this could best be achieved by agreeing the modalities of EU funding in a decision adopted by the European Parliament and the Council.
I have no time to give the Parliament details of the road map adopted last December by Ecofin, but allow me in half a minute just to read some of the commitments that were sent to the Commission.
We are working on all of these things.
By April 2008 the Commission should prepare an assessment of how to clarify the role of the committees and to consider all the different options towards strengthening the working of these committees.
By mid-2008, the level three committees should for the first time transmit to the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council draft work programmes, and thereafter start reporting annually on progress.
This committee should also explore the possibility of strengthening the national application of guidelines, recommendations and standards; they should introduce in their charters the possibility of applying qualified majority voting coupled with a comply or explain procedure; they should study the possibilities of introducing a common set of operational guidelines for the operation of colleges of supervisors and monitor the coherence of the practices of the different colleges of supervisors.
The level three committees and the Commission should suggest - also by mid-2008 - a timetable for the introduction of EU-wide reporting format for single data requirements and reporting dates.
By the end of 2008, the Commission has also committed itself to conduct a cross-sectoral stock-taking exercise of the coherence, equivalence and actual use of sanctioning powers among Member States.
The Commission should consider - also by the end of 2008 - financial support under the EU budget.
And, as I said before, it should study the possibilities for EU funding under the EU budget of the development of tools to help build a common supervisory culture by the level three committees.
The Commission and the committees should review financial services directives to include provisions to enable the use of voluntary delegation of tasks, analyse the options for voluntary delegation of competences and so on and so forth. So we are working a lot and we should work a lot in the coming weeks, months and before the end of this year.
But we are working at the same time on the financial turmoil by following the road map that was adopted in October 2007 by Ecofin.
A report on how we are working on this road map to tackle the financial turmoil consequences has been sent to the European Council for discussions in a few days in Brussels.
We contributed to this report with a communication.
The Economic and Financial Committee the other day also presented its own report to Ecofin.
We discussed both reports at Ecofin level and these reports are on the table for the discussions of the Heads of State and Government next Thursday and Friday.
These reports convey the simple message: in order to respond to the concerns of our citizens and investors we must act swiftly and in a consistent way.
We need to restore confidence and stability as soon as possible, having carefully considered all the options and in line with the better regulation principles.
I think everybody acknowledges that this road map, adopted a few months ago by Ecofin, provides the right answer to the problems identified.
Work on these road map commitments is on track.
In the months to come it will be crucial to stick to the timetable and show that the EU is responding effectively to the crisis.
Our regulatory and supervisory framework must remain robust and keep pace with market developments.
Although the Basle II rules have only been fully implemented as of 1 January 2008 further improvements have already been planned in the capital requirements directive.
This work has taken on increased importance in the light of the recent turmoil and maybe there will be other aspects of Basle II that we will need to address in the time ahead.
We intend to adopt a new proposal for this directive in October so that discussion in Parliament and the Council can take place before the adoption of a new directive in April 2009.
We appreciate very much the involvement of Parliament in all these discussions.
We need Parliament's contribution and we appreciate this involvement and this contribution.
On 1 April - a few days before the next informal Ecofin - Mr McCreevy will go to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
And, as you know, from a macro-financial stability point of view, I, as the Commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, am always ready to contribute to the discussions in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in this Parliament.
Finally, on macro-financial issues, it is true that we need to improve the supervisory and regulatory framework - it is absolutely true at European level and at a global level - but we will not put an end to these bubbles, this excess of liquidity, this risk to financial stability unless we seriously tackle global imbalances.
This is the real origin of these imbalances.
We cannot solve the current or previous problems, or perhaps the next challenges to the functioning of the global economy, without tackling the global imbalances that are still there.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, in 1999 we initiated the European single financial market project and have since been pressing ahead with it.
We are on the path to success.
We now have to see that market developments do not overtake political developments.
The Lamfalussy Process was a step in this direction.
Level 3 could be a way of bringing supervisors in Europe a step closer together.
However, I hold on to what Commissioner Almunia has said, and that is: act quickly and effectively.
We are going through a sub-prime crisis or sub-prime turbulence.
The Americans - whether they are the SEC, the White House, politicians or the offices of the District Attorney in New York or Washington - have long been drawing up the relevant summaries and thinking about what measures are required, while finance ministers in Europe are still reflecting on which direction they could be taking.
The finance ministers are refusing to push a European supervisory structure, so I shall not be talking about a European supervisor here.
What the finance ministers already have to answer for, however - and here I appeal specifically to the Council - is the fact that Europe is not present at the international discussion on how to deal with this problem.
Once again we shall ultimately find ourselves merely adopting the rules of other nations, such as the United States, for example.
I would just remind you of the Katiforis report.
After Parmalat and Enron, we asked the Commission and Council in 2003-2006 to speak out on rating agencies.
The Commission does indeed analyse everything in Europe, but when crises arise, no analysis takes place.
On the subject of hedge funds, for instance, no analysis is taking place in the European Union.
Hence my urgent appeal: throw off your lethargy, leave your national egotisms behind and keep working on turning the European financial market into a success story not only in Europe, so that what has stood the test here also becomes the rule throughout the world.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, let me first make two preliminary remarks.
One is that I would have liked to discuss with Mr Almunia these global imbalances and monetary intervention etc., but we will do that with Mr Trichet in another configuration.
But what I want to stress here is that if we had not had this ECB structure, this system of European banks that intervened in the present turmoil, we would be much worse off.
I think that this balance exists in monetary policy - we have had this type of European-level execution of activity, but we do not have it in the supervisory aspects.
This is necessary for ex ante prevention instead of only intervention measures.
My second preliminary remark is about the absence of Charlie McCreevy.
I think it is unacceptable that he does not want to discuss this with us.
Maybe he is dealing with his personal future, but I would say for the 2009 Commission that it would be worthwhile considering having a special Commissioner for the financial markets who will concentrate only on this, because I think this is a really major subject for Europe and for the European Commission.
Then, on the issue of the supervision - the road map you have described - I do not think we disagree on the measures, but I would have expected - and I said this very clearly in the level three committee at the annual joint meeting held in November - that these measures should also have been the elements of a clear proposal for legislative measures from the Commission.
The Commission has the right of initiative, they can put proposals on the table, and we would have been able to act swiftly and consistently if we had had a concrete proposal.
Because now, a lot of these measures are only voluntary: they are requests to committees which really do not have the powers, the mandates, the competences and the tools to do what we would like them to do, because they are nationally organised and do not have this European mandate.
This could have been the subject of a European Commission proposal in this regard.
Why is the Commission so slow in acting?
I think one of the reasons is that they want these level three committees to be merely advisory and not the central tool for European supervision.
I think this is something we also have to acknowledge: that they play this important role and that we need to have, like the European Central Bank, a real, independent supervisory structure which can deal with these subjects.
It should not be only the Commission - as DG Competition - dealing with it, because the Commission is too weak in this respect.
Concerning the Council, I would really hope that you see the sense of urgency and discuss further measures on the architecture of supervision.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, a dynamic and healthy financial sector is crucial for the stability of the European economy and for global competitiveness.
This is vitally important for consumers and companies.
With this in mind, we all agree on the need for financial institutions to be well managed and supervised.
That is why in 2001 we launched what is known as the Lamfalussy Process, with the aim of putting in place an efficient mechanism for convergence between the various Member States and partners in terms of supervisory practice and financial regulation.
Now the Commission is asking us to approve a series of new initiatives relating to the adoption of legislation, the convergence of supervision and the strengthening of cooperation between the supervisory bodies in the various Member States.
We agree with all of this because we need a strong and healthy financial sector that is capable of supporting our economy in the face of the turbulence on the international markets, but we want even more.
We want the Savings Directive, which has been in force since 2005, to be examined in order to put an end to scandals such as Liechtenstein, which appears to be hiding tax evaders.
There should not be Member States, linked territories or countries associated with the European Economic Area that, under the protection of banking secrecy, do not exchange information on interest paid to residents of other members of that same common economic space.
Free competition prohibits State aid as a way of promoting the private economy; and taxation of savings should not be a gateway for distorting equal competition.
The rules of the game should be the same for everyone and we should therefore eradicate tax havens, as they are anti-competitive and also anti-social.
Madam President, two minutes is not long enough to allow me to take on board all the points.
I would just like to be very brief.
I am in agreement with many of the things mentioned by my colleagues, especially what Ms van den Burg said about Commission reluctance to give a greater role to level three committees.
I think that it is natural that level three committees have two different roles.
They have succeeded well in giving advice on new directives.
The advisory role is very well accomplished, but we have not yet found a way to achieve true convergence in Europe.
There is a real asymmetry between European convergence and national accountability.
Although we wholeheartedly support the Ecofin proposals, the road map and everything that has been produced, we have doubts that they will solve the problems we have in Europe.
Is it really possible to achieve fully integrated management with the current supervisory system?
I do not think this is the case.
We also think that consolidating the supervisory model of the CRD needs much bigger improvements than the ones presented in the road map.
It is not enough to have good delegational powers, good information requirements and to solve home host issues.
We need to give level three committees more decisive powers.
They need to be more independent of the Commission and to be the seed of the new European supervisory network-based system.
Finally, I would like to raise the issue, which was also dealt with by my colleague, Mr Radwan, of US convergence and global consequences.
I think we are losing time in Europe.
If we do not get our act together, we cannot really be taken seriously by our international colleagues.
Even though the financial services dialogue has developed well, we need to further improve our route to convergence in order to show the Americans that we have an equivalent system and can rely on mutual recognition and even substituted compliance.
So this global aspect is very important to take on board.
(PT) Madam President, the recent turbulence in the financial markets showed that the trend which gave rise to increased efficiency might also entail greater risks, affecting the soundness of the financial system and the health of the real economy.
The review planned for 2007 thus became more urgent and acquired greater political relevance.
Today Europe is being asked to produce careful and effective responses to suit the growing complexity of the markets.
It is also known that progress is possible without altering the central architecture of the Lamfalussy method but, as many of my fellow Members have said, one of the most obvious and urgent tools for obtaining improvements involves stronger and more effective coordination between national regulators and supervisors through greater efficiency at Level 3, increasing powers and competence, strengthening the mechanisms for managing turbulent situations and crises and ensuring consistency of principles and practices.
Such coordination is complex and does not arise spontaneously: it requires specific, competent initiatives on the part of the Commission, in response to the recommendations, rightly mentioned here today, made by Parliament on various occasions, and by the Ecofin Council, and set out in the roadmap which has been extensively quoted here.
With the next European Council approaching, the apparent lack of transparency of the initiatives planned by the Commission is surprising.
The absence of Commissioner McCreevy is even more surprising when Parliament has expressly asked him for information on the progress of the work.
Finally, I should like to thank Commissioner Almunia once again for his availability, although I still think we need to have a clarifying debate with the Commissioner responsible in accordance with the specific and technical nature of the subject, and the Commission's obligation to propose a specific initiative.
(ES) Madam President, the Lamfalussy Process was created so that Community legislation on financial matters could respond quickly and flexibly to developments in the market and in order to encourage convergence of supervisory practices.
Its activities, on all four levels, have enabled the actions of the institutions and the supervisory authorities in the European Union to be better coordinated.
We need to go further.
In order to increase its legitimacy, quality and coherence we need to continue to reinforce the principles of better regulation and democratic scrutiny, improving the integration of its levels and promoting greater inter-sectoral convergence in order to avoid arbitrage.
A European perspective and new steps are essential for responding to these needs and especially for adequately tackling the supervision of cross-border groups and moving forward with the prevention and management of international crises.
(DE) Madam President, financial stability through crisis management must now be the standard when developing regulatory convergence.
It is about drawing lessons from the financial crises and developments in the finance industry that get out of hand and are no longer compatible with an adequate macroeconomy.
This means that a sustainable basis for the Lamfalussy Process still needs to be created in 2008.
The requirements of the market operators call for a flexible regulatory procedure.
The requirement here has to be that supervisory action is provided for by parliamentary control and Parliament's rights are protected.
There is no transparent control without parliamentarianism.
Our path leads straight into a system of European supervisory authorities via the lead supervisor.
Only in a European system of supervisory authorities can a balance be found between European financial centres that takes account of all the political and economic interests.
The Commission must be a player, not just a moderator, in the intermediate stages here.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the Lamfalussy Process has commendably seen us through over the years to this specific focal point of the financial mechanisms.
On the other hand we have continually been trying to keep democratic law-making going there, too, as part of the normal discussion of the Constitution, where we have law-making delegated from the European institutions.
We always have the same problem in both cases, namely ensuring that we are able on the one hand to guarantee a modicum of transparency and on the other hand that Parliament is sufficiently involved in controlling this.
Are practical efforts being made to bring the general discussions closer together in the context of comitology and the Lamfalussy Process in particular, so that we do not continue to have this array of processes and another component of transparency is thereby taken from us?
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Madam President, I will try to be very brief, but I wanted to make a few brief comments on some of the speeches that have been made.
First of all, it is clear that there is asymmetry between the national structure of supervisors, the financial supervision structures, and the growing importance of the supranational institutions, and the global, rather than just the European dimension, of the financial markets and financial activity.
This asymmetry causes tension and demands a response from the European institutions, from the Commission and from the Council and Parliament.
We are not going to discuss this, as I think that we are all in agreement on it.
Secondly, I am not so much in agreement with some speeches that may have suggested that the structures for supervision and for reacting to events in the financial system in the United States are superior to those that we have in Europe.
I sincerely believe that the facts do not show this, but rather that there is an argument in favour of the European regulation and supervision structures and the way that the financial markets function in Europe in a whole series of areas compared with what happens in the United States.
Thirdly, the Lamfalussy Level 3 Committees are extraordinarily important.
Two of the three Level 3 Committees, the Banking Committee and the Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee, were only created in 2005, even though the Lamfalussy Process began in 1999.
We need to make up for lost time, but a great deal of time was wasted before this Commission came in.
Fourthly, how do we move forward?
It appears from some of the speeches that some of you think that it is the Commission's responsibility to make the decision to move forward at the right pace.
I am not going to hide the Commission's responsibilities, which it does have, as do Parliament and the Council, and of course the Member States.
My experience of taking part in many recent discussions in Ecofin, and also in the Eurogroup, on developments in supervision and regulation and on how to deal with the turbulence in the financial markets and respond to the uncertainty, lack of confidence and failings that we are seeing in the system, my experience, which I can share with you and you can choose to believe it or not, is that the greatest obstacles to moving forward are the positions of some Member States.
This is not, however, in Member States that are not suffering the consequences of the financial turbulence.
There is a lot of work being done.
I understand why Parliament wants the work to go more quickly, but I think that Parliament has the same information as the Commission and the Council, and therefore knows that a great deal of work is being done in many directions at once.
We are in a situation in which improvisation tends to lead to mistakes, and in which trying to do things before we know what needs to be done tends to be counterproductive.
There are experiences in Europe and the United States relating to previous supervision problems and previous regulation problems, previous financial problems, that show that it is better to wait for a few months and get it right than speed up the possible response and make the problems that we want to tackle even worse.
One last consideration: the Commission has the right of legislative initiative in the European Union.
The Commission is never going to give up its right of initiative, it is never going to hand over this right of initiative to the Lamfalussy Committees.
It takes them into account, but it is never going to consider that the Commission's right of initiative should be handed over to the Lamfalussy Committees, and I do not think Parliament or the Council think so either.
What is true, as I have said, is that all of us, starting with the Commission, think that the coordination between the Level 3 Lamfalussy Committees, the capacity to adopt criteria and decisions with a system of majority voting, the capacity to react with almost binding decisions, is something that is increasingly evident and increasingly necessary, in view of the extraordinary importance of the task that these committees have to carry out.
However, this should not lead us to confuse them with the holders of the right of legislative initiative in Europe.
The debate is closed.
Commission Question Time
The next item is Question Time (B6-0013/2008).
I am sorry for those colleagues who have been waiting for this to start and, clearly, we will have to look at why we are so late in starting today.
Madam President, on a point of order, according to the parliamentary website Oral Questions, my question was No 3 on the list.
The question was designed to be answered by Commissioner Mandelson, as its title clearly stated 'WTO talks' and Mr Mandelson is conducting those talks on our behalf.
However, I now see that my question has been put into section 3, which means that it will not be verbally answered by Commissioner Mandelson.
I am asking whether he is refusing to be accountable to the House for the WTO negotiations.
What is the point in tabling a question to a Commissioner who is present on the day if the Commissioner refuses to answer that question?
It is the Commission that decides who answers which questions.
Madam President, that is the problem, because the question, on WTO talks, was clearly for Commissioner Mandelson.
He is the Commissioner who was conducting those talks, he is here today and he is refusing to answer the question.
Ms Harkin, your point is noted and we will do what we can.
The following questions are addressed to the Commission.
Part one
Subject: Negative impact on business of the international credit crisis
The current international credit crisis, which is leading the US economy into recession, is slowing down the rate of growth at world level.
The effects on the European economy and business are substantial.
Greek and other European companies are already coming under considerable pressure from the increase in imports from non-EU countries whose cheaper products are constantly gaining ground on the market.
At the same time, a fall in European exports is forecast for the current year.
What measures will the Commission take to provide European companies with effective support to survive this crisis and become more commercially competitive at international level?
Which sectors of commerce and which European products does it consider to be most vulnerable?
Which should be protected as a matter of priority and how can that be achieved?
Member of the Commission. - (ES) Madam President, in response to Mr Arnaoutakis's question, I must say firstly that the global economy is in the process of slowing down; it is cooling down, to use climate terminology.
The financial turbulence is continuing; the US economy is in a process of marked slowdown - some think that it is on the brink of recession.
Prices of raw materials, not only oil but also other raw materials, are increasing, and all this is having a negative impact on growth, although the growth of the global economy is still substantial.
The European economy is dealing relatively well with these difficulties.
In our recent forecasts, presented on 21 February, we talked about 2% growth for the European Union this year, and 1.8% for the euro area.
There is therefore an impact on the European economy, but the extent of it should not be exaggerated.
With regard to external trade, the most recent figures published by Eurostat show that, for 2007, the initial estimate talks about a trade deficit in the European Union of 27 of EUR 185 000 million, which is a substantial trade deficit, but in any event lower than many of the other areas of industrialised countries, and the euro area has a trade surplus of EUR 28 300 million.
Therefore, in a global economy characterised by major imbalances, our external sector is balanced in general, and not only our external sector, but our public accounts are also basically balanced.
Third point: the best way of dealing with the crisis in the global economy is to maintain the structural reforms and macroeconomic policies that have enabled us to get our public accounts back on track, improve the stability of our economies, improve our capacity for growth and be in a better position than before to face up to financial turbulence.
Fourthly, there are specific problems to deal with as a result of this turbulence.
We discussed these in the previous debate, so I am not going to repeat them.
I will, however, remind the Member and the House that there are roadmaps adopted by the Ecofin Council in October that establish how to react to this financial turbulence.
Fifthly, I would also like to remind the Member and Parliament that in October 2006 we adopted a strategy for the EU's external economic action, the Global Europe programme, which establishes a new European trade policy to improve our external competitiveness, with strategies relating to market access, protecting intellectual property rights, open public procurement abroad, trade defence instruments, a policy of not just multilateral agreements in the context of the World Trade Organization, but also a new generation of bilateral trade agreements that complement the efforts to move forward in the multilateral negotiations in the Doha Round.
To conclude this answer, I would like to say that the facts show, in particular for European economies, that market integration, globalisation and liberalisation of trade are beneficial to our economies and bring many more benefits than disadvantages or problems.
Globalisation and, in the European context, the single market, are essential tools for improving our competitiveness and, as Europeans know very well, probably better than anyone else in the world, protectionism is not the solution.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to ask you whether there has been any assessment by the Commission of how this international credit crisis will affect sectors such as tourism and shipping, which in the case of my country, Greece, represent 21% of the GDP.
What measures does the Commission intend to take?
Member of the Commission. - (ES) No, I cannot give you such specific and detailed calculations as you are asking for.
It is very possible that the Greek authorities have made these estimates.
We estimated the impact of the financial turbulence and the more economically challenging international climate on the European economies in our updated forecasts in February, and we estimated that there is going to be less growth, five tenths less growth in the European Union, and four tenths less growth in the euro area compared with the forecasts that we presented in November 2007.
Also half a point more inflation, basically as a result of the 'shock' of the increase in oil prices, raw materials, and in particular, food raw materials.
Thus far, the impact on exports is very small, not to say that it has not been felt until now, but as we have said on many occasions, especially recently when the exchange markets have been extremely volatile, we feel that the changes in and volatility of exchange rates as they affect us as Europeans are reaching limits that are causing us great concern, and we need to remind all the other players in the global economy that excessive volatility in the exchange markets is undesirable, because it has negative consequences in terms of growth and economic activity, for everyone.
- (LT) Businesses are influenced not only by international crises, but also, as has just been mentioned, by currency exchange rates.
A country with a strong currency can struggle in the competition stakes in international markets.
At present the euro is so strong that businesses have started to complain that exporting is no longer profitable.
Could any measures be taken to alleviate this problem?
Sometimes countries try to devalue their currency in order to make a profit from sales abroad.
Member of the Commission. - (ES) As the honourable Member knows, the exchange markets, in the vast majority of countries, and in particular in more advanced industrialised economies, are governed by flexible exchange rates.
It is the law of supply and demand that sets exchange rates at any given time.
What is desirable is for all the players, all those that are part of the global economy, and in particular, the exchange markets, to keep to the guidelines that we agreed in the G7, in the International Monetary Fund, in the multilateral consultations, that took place a year ago now, in order to try to deal with the global imbalances in the economy.
One of the conclusions of those multilateral consultations had to do with the need to give the exchange markets the freedom to reflect the fundamentals of each economy, and this is the best way for exchange rates not to be collectively detrimental to the players, the participants in the international markets.
Thus far, for the euro area, if we look at the figures published by Eurostat for 2007, the first Eurostat figures for 2007, published on 15 February, over last year exports from countries in the euro area, which is thirteen countries, grew by 8%, while imports grew by 6%.
However, at the same time it is true that the changes in interest rates concern us; and in particular we are concerned by the changes in recent weeks.
This was said as a result of the last meeting of the Eurogroup last week, by the Chairman of the Eurogroup, the Chairman of the European Central Bank and by me as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs.
We are taking note of the will of the US authorities, which are still repeating publicly that they want to maintain a strong currency.
We are taking note of the announcements and declarations of intention from the authorities in countries such as China and other emerging Asian economies, which are saying that they are aware of the need to gradually introduce more flexibility in the management of exchange rates.
While we change to Commissioner FigeÄŸ for the next question, may I take the opportunity to return to Ms Harkin's earlier point of order.
I have caused some enquiries to be made and my first point would be that we are dealing with Question Time to the Commission, not to a particular Commissioner.
The Commission has looked at the point you raised and has consulted DG Trade and DG AGRI and in their estimation, I am afraid, your question falls within the competence of Commissioner Fischer Boel.
I cannot enter into debate, but I pass on that information to you so that you know the reasoning.
Subject: Legal downloads of songs from the Internet
On 28 January 2008, an agreement was signed between the three biggest record companies (EMI, Universal Music and Warner Music) to make 25 million songs available on the Qtrax website for free downloading by users.
While downloading is in progress, however, users have to watch the advertising on the site.
This website is available to residents of Europe and the USA and it is estimated that the site's creators will soon recoup their investment.
Given that there is no EU legal framework covering online music services - as, following the recent recommendation, the Commission does not intend to propose a legally binding framework - and that this agreement was made largely to safeguard the rights and profits of the record companies affected by illegal downloading, in what way are the rights of the artists protected within this framework?
In view of the fact that this website is also aimed at European citizens, does the Commission consider that competition in music services will be undermined since this agreement involves only three record companies which will make their songs available on the Internet free of charge and will enjoy the profits from advertising on the same website?
Member of the Commission. - I am sure that Mr Mavrommatis recalls that Qtrax recently announced a new agreement with several major labels to offer the first free and legal advertisement-supported peer-to-peer service with major music labels on their website.
It happened at the MIDEM Conference in Cannes in January.
However, it seems that no deal is currently in place that would allow free downloads of their music catalogues.
Indeed, in reaction to the Qtrax announcement, the four major companies have publicly stated that no deal has yet been finalised, although negotiations are ongoing.
At this stage, there are still uncertainties as to how many agreements Qtrax will eventually sign with the major music labels and as to the content and the scope of these agreements.
It is therefore too early to make any preliminary assessment of the impact on competition in the online music industry.
However, it is clear that such a service would not only have to be licensed by the record labels, but the authors who wrote and composed the music would also, of course, have to be part of the agreement.
(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, as I have said in my question, there are three companies making a profit.
I ask again, Commissioner: will other unprotected companies have to close down, leaving the rights of thousands of artists unprotected, at the very time when online music services are steadily gaining strength?
Or am I to believe Mr McCreevy, who has told us that such a directive will be put before the European Parliament in 2010?
Member of the Commission. - Firstly, I would like to assure you once again that the competition policy of the Union and this Commission is an ongoing process.
We check and test and, if needed, we act or react.
Secondly, the adaptation of important rules or frameworks for online content or cross-border rules for the provision of services, including now for copyrights or even terms of protection, are part of the gradual adaptation.
Some of them will probably be adapted this year.
Some proposals have been on the table since autumn last year.
So I think it is an important process, where we are working together, where a cultural context or impact is duly taken into account and cultural diversity protected and promoted.
We are not advising what individual companies should do in terms of the behaviour of others, but it is important that transparency and favourable conditions for creativity and for the dissemination of culture are preserved and promoted.
I think this is our common cause and our common concern.
I am sure that this is the case in the Committee on Culture and Education, of which you are vice-chairman, Mr Mavrommatis.
(ES) Commissioner, I assume that you know that in some States there is a method for paying authors' rights that involves establishing a charge that must be paid by all those who buy equipment to record or reproduce material, or buy CDs or DVDs.
I wanted to ask you whether you think that this method is acceptable, when there are many people who buy such equipment or DVDs and do not use them either to download music or to reproduce anything that affects authors' rights.
I think that this method is punishing honest citizens.
I would like to know your opinion on this.
Member of the Commission. - It is true that in some countries these copyright levies are really very high or the differences are striking.
This is one of topics which we are dealing with.
We did it last year, and I am sure that the Commission will come back to these issues.
My colleague, Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, is responsible for this file, and I see it in connection with other areas where either copyrights, terms of protection or authors' rights are concerned or touched upon.
So I know about the issues, but thank you for the message, which is repeated by some countries and some industries.
I am sure that this will be part of reviews in the near future.
Subject: Carbon tariffs on imports?
On 23 January 2008 the European Commission put forward a far-reaching package of proposals that will deliver on the European Union's ambitious commitments to fight climate change and promote renewable energy up to 2020 and beyond.
Central to the strategy is a strengthening and expansion of the Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the EU's key tool for cutting emissions cost-effectively.
Emissions from the sectors covered by the system will be cut by 21% by 2020 compared with levels in 2005.
A single EU-wide cap on ETS emissions will be set, and free allocation of emission allowances will be progressively replaced by auctioning of allowances by 2020.
Under any international agreement, which would ensure that competitors in other parts of the world bear a comparable cost, the risk of carbon leakage could well be negligible.
However, such an agreement is not yet in place.
In light of the above, can the Commission comment as to why carbon tariffs on imports into the EU were excluded from the EU ETS?
Secondly, can the Commission further indicate the degree of support in the College of Commissioners on the issue of carbon tariffs on products from countries that have no CO2 reduction legislation in place?
Has the WTO a view on this?
Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, it is a top priority for the Commission to conclude a far-reaching international agreement on climate change, covering the period after 2012.
The Bali Conference was a significant step in the effort to confront climate change at world level.
All the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, including the United States, China and India, agreed to begin formal negotiations.
What we need now - as it is a key priority for the EU and the Commission - is an agreement by the end of 2009 on a future international legal framework on climate.
This framework must be generally applicable; it must ensure that all parties are committed participants, and it must be effective.
To achieve the desired result, which is, as we have said, an international agreement, the EU really must continue to play a leading role, as it certainly did up to and of course during the Bali Conference.
This is precisely the significance of the package of proposals on climate and renewable sources of energy, which the Commission submitted on 23 January.
The EU must retain its leading role and clearly show determination to proceed.
The EU emission allowance trading system is our basic means of channelling investments towards cleaner technologies.
This system ensures that the greenhouse gas targets set by the EU can be achieved at the lowest possible cost.
The EU proposal for a revised directive on the trading system envisages auctioning as the main method of distributing allowances.
Auctioning not only provides incentives for investments in low carbon emission technologies; it also prevents the undesirable consequences of unfair allocation and unjustifiable profits.
For this reason, the Commission proposes that, from the start of the third trading period, allowances should no longer be allocated free of charge to power-generating companies, and in the industrial sector, free allocation will be progressively curtailed with a target of complete abolition in 2020.
Some energy-intensive sectors or industries operate in a fiercely competitive international market.
As a result, they cannot pass on the cost to the consumer without the risk of losing a large part of the market.
If there is no international agreement, they risk relocating outside Europe, with the result that worldwide greenhouse gas emissions (carbon leakage) will increase.
The sectors where this risk of carbon leakage plays a part must be specified objectively.
The Commission therefore proposes that this question should be examined thoroughly and that a list of vulnerable sectors or industries be drawn up by 2010.
By June 2011 the Commission will assess the situation in these energy-intensive industries.
