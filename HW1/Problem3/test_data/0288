That, then, is what I am taking into account.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner eÂ Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, we know that transport is a delicate issue.
I would, therefore, be interested to know what the situation actually is regarding the inquiry into the legal bases, that is to say the current legal bases according to the and the provision for the intended legal bases, for example, the infrastructure costs directive as well as vignettes, toll, road pricing, ecopoints â in fact, the whole caboodle.
In my view, it is very important for the strategy, and for its implementation in the Member States, that we keep the argument right to the point and that we try to bring the current and future measures into line.
Â Â  . Mr RÃŒbig, there is currently a set of rules, known as Eurovignette, which establishes the criteria according to which payment can be established for the use of certain infrastructures, that is to say tolls.
The problem is that we believe that this Directive is not sufficiently clear or complete and, for example, does not provide for the possibility of cross-funding of alternative infrastructures, an issue which appears to be essential if we are to establish adequate infrastructures within the European Union.
We have therefore made a proposal on a legal basis, the legal basis for transport, which is approved by a majority and does not require unanimity.
It is true that the current Eurovignette Directive has a different legal basis, the fiscal legal basis; it is therefore considered a tax, while in the proposal we are now making, what we are proposing is a payment for the costs incurred as a result of the use of an infrastructure.
Furthermore, we can maintain that legal basis, which is the one for transport, because we are talking about a payment for the use of an infrastructure, provided that the money received in this way does not enter the Stateâs accounts, because if it enters the public accounts, the administrative budgets, whether of the State, of the Autonomous Community or of a region, we would automatically be returning to the fiscal legal basis and it would therefore require unanimity.
Therefore, Mr RÃŒbig, I believe it is essential that we preserve what is laid out in this proposal: to link that income to the use of the infrastructure, to the maintenance of infrastructures and the transport sector, and not to link this income to public income, the income of administrations, because in that case, I would repeat, we would have to opt for a different legal basis and we would have to approve it unanimously, and I do not know if that would be the best approach if we really want to achieve a modification in the Eurovignette Directive.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Ceyhun, the Commission is aware of the events that you describe in your question.
These are events that, I am sorry to say, we are not just aware of in Bulgaria but also in many other countries in this world, and I think that you know as well as I do why these events occur.
Nevertheless, we must remember that the behaviour of police and customs officials, as described in your question, is illegal; it also constitutes a criminal offence according to Bulgarian law and must be punished.
The Commission has had regular and in-depth discussions with the Bulgarian Government about these issues and has pressed for measures aimed at resolving them.
I must, however, mention that the Commission is not in any way able to open investigations in individual cases and in any case this is the responsibility of the national authorities.
In my view, the problem of corruption at a border crossing or in transit is a question that, as well as being considered in terms of the rule of law, must also be considered in terms of fighting corruption.
In its cooperation with Bulgaria, the Commission gave particular priority to both of these questions.
What I would like to say is that I believe that the whole criminal justice system in Bulgaria needs to be radically reformed and this belief is shared by the Bulgarian Government.
It was difficult to achieve this and it has not yet been fully achieved because to do so required a change in the constitution, which has been blocked for many years.
During a visit to Bulgaria this summer I intervened in a very unconventional way to try to overcome this blockade.
My attempt was successful, and the constitutional change has now been adopted so that all obstacles to the necessary judicial reform have been removed, and the Commission is holding further talks with the Bulgarian authorities on widespread support for it.
Furthermore, in cooperation with the Commission, the Bulgarian Government has drawn up an action plan to fight corruption, which will now be gradually implemented.
This involves radical reform of toll and police management and tighter control measures.
The Bulgarian Government has pledged to ensure that all citizens have access to an efficient complaints procedure.
The measures that were implemented last year have, in the meantime, led to 218 disciplinary procedures against customs officials and 212 actions against police officials.
To date forty customs officials and forty-seven police officers have been sacked.
The Commission will continue to follow future development in this area and make full use of the instruments that we have available in order to make sure Bulgaria adheres to international standards and to help Bulgaria to do so.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner erheugen, I would like to mention that the Bulgarian authorities have in the meantime apologised to me, as I myself experienced this with my German passport.
I would now like to put aside this question because I believe that you will continue to work in this area and that this problem will be resolved, if at all possible, before 2007.
Â Â  . â Community legislation on medicines strictly regulates their authorisation, their placing on the market, and their classification.
The same applies to their advertising.
Nevertheless, the supply of medicines to private individuals, in other words the sale to the public by a pharmacist, is not regulated at Community level under pharmaceutical legislation.
As a result, the sale of medicines to private individuals through the Internet is not covered by European pharmaceutical legislation.
Sales of this nature fall under national provisions, which must be seen in the context of the âgeneral principlesâ of the Treaty, in other words, ArticlesÂ 28 to 30 on the free movement of goods.
The Commission does not, therefore, have accurate figures on the scale of legal electronic sales of medicines in the European Union.
Nor does it have figures for the total quantity of medicines supplied through the Internet within the European Union and beyond its borders, with or without an electronic prescription.
This issue could also be considered in light of the Directive on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts, which lays down that, in order to guarantee a higher level of consumer protection, Member States can adopt or uphold stricter provisions, providing that these are compatible with the Treaty.
These provisions include, should this prove necessary, banning the marketing on their territory, by means of a remote contract, of certain goods or services, in particular medicines, in compliance with the Treaty.
The issue of the compatibility of national measures with the Treaty, in other words ArticlesÂ 28 to 30, is currently the subject of the DocMorrisÂ NV and Jacques Waterval case, which is pending in the Court of Justice.
The issue mainly concerns looking at the proportionality of national measures of this nature and the justification for them, in order to protect human health and life.
The sale of medicines through the Internet raises issues of health protection and legal issues and improving the information available to patients is precisely one of the key elements of the recent Commission communication entitled âA Stronger European-based Pharmaceutical Industry for the Benefit of the Patient â A Call for Actionâ.
The Commission has committed itself to looking into setting up a realistic and practical framework for informing patients about prescription medicines.
By the way, the Commission intends to set up a European health portal which could address these issues.
It should, however, be noted that it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States to inform consumers about the dangers of buying over the Internet and to monitor these activities.
The Commission can, therefore, only act in a very limited set of circumstances.
Â Â  Commissioner, I am of course sorry that we do not have more specific details to show us the extent and gravity of the problem.
Allow me, therefore, to tell you that the turnover from the electronic trade in pharmaceutical products exceeds EUR 5 billion, while we do not know who is selling the pharmaceutical products.
Inquiries conducted into the matter have shown that they are people engaged in criminal activities.
Similarly, we do not know the place of origin of the pharmaceutical products, because they often do not come from places such as the USA or Canada, but from India or Brazil, with the result that the composition and content of the pharmaceutical product are very harmful and bear no relation to the indications.
There is also a circuit of counterfeit, fictitious medical opinions, which result in a threat to the life of the person accepting the pharmaceutical product.
This too has been observed in Great Britain.
Unfortunately, in 2003 alone, more than 600 British subjects purchased pharmaceutical products over the Internet.
Do we really have to allow this advertising, especially when it concerns young ages?
The pharmaceutical products which have the greatest market penetration via the Internet are for the overweight.
So they concern very young ages.
I think that, irrespective of national legislation, we absolutely must take steps at Community level also.
Â Â  . Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Staes for tabling a question on adding water and protein to chicken meat.
This issue was debated during sitting of 1 July 2003, so it is now an opportunity to inform the House about the present state of play.
I would first like to say a few words on the background to this issue.
As you know, the Irish and UK authorities have revealed fraudulent practices designed to artificially increase the weight of poultry-meat by adding water and protein to other ingredients.
The process is used to retain a large quantity of water, up to 40% or indeed, even as high as 50%.
That is the reason why I have asked my services to do all they can in order to improve this unfortunate situation.
In line with the proposal made by the UK authorities, my services have been working on a Commission directive in order to highlight, on the label, the presence of added water in such products.
A draft has been discussed with experts from Member States and stakeholders.
It provides a requirement to include 'with added water', and the percentage of water added, in the name of the product itself.
However, I remain of the opinion that labelling products to which water has been added is only the second best solution if water has been added only to increase artificially the weight and therefore to mislead the consumer.
The practice of adding water to food in order to cheat the consumer is despicable.
I have therefore again asked my services to examine whether there is any possibility of banning this practice under current Community law, and that work is being undertaken at the moment.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your answer.
I would like to ask a few supplementary questions.
So far there has been talk of these practices from the Netherlands happening in Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Is there now any view of whether these practices have taken place in other Member States as well?
In the debate on 1 July you announced that there would be more cooperation between the Member States and the Commission to tighten the controls on fraudsters.
What steps have you now taken in this regard?
You have already answered a number of other questions I was about to ask.
But on 1 July you also announced that you would be developing standards for meat products.
As regards the presence of water, you have answered that.
But what about the presence of other proteins, âchicken meatâ that contains beef or pork proteins?
What is the state of play on that point?
Can you offer any prospect of a total ban on this practice?
Because I think that the last part of your answer is absolutely right: really this practice is totally unacceptable and there should be a total ban on these practices.
Do you have any idea of when such a ban might be issued and whether it could be issued?
Â Â  . Investigative work is being undertaken in conjunction with Member States.
I am in a position to say to you that this practice appears to be continuing.
Therefore there is continuing concern in Member States and at Commission level.
A number of steps have been taken in relation to this, not only at an investigative level.
I have also asked my services to conduct a detailed legal analysis of the current legislation in place dealing with this kind of situation.
In particular, I have asked for an analysis of Council Directive 71/18/EEC: the belief is that piece of legislation bans the inclusion of water and hydrolysed protein for the purpose of retaining the water.
That is currently under legal analysis.
It is my intention, when that analysis is complete, to prepare a Commission communication for presentation to the Member States.
It is rather early, at this stage, to give you further detail on the ongoing investigation and analysis of the legal position and the legislation already in place, but I hope to be in a position to do so in the relatively near future, and to present a communication that will be available for discussion in Parliament in due course.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, in connection with the study dealing with the evolution of rules pertaining to meat products, it is also possible to investigate the restrictions which relate to the mechanical separation of meat and bone matter.
For example, this restriction, which forbids the mechanical separation of meat and bones, sounds quite crazy as far as poultry are concerned.
Of course I understand that this is necessary for beef to prevent the spread of BSE.
I have heard, however, that the Commission is planning such a ban for poultry too.
That would mean significant costs for broiler production, for example, and it cannot be regarded as a rational move that the mechanical separation of poultry meat and bone should also be totally banned.
Can you tell us if the intention in this communication that the Commission is to issue is also to deal with the rules on meat products on a broader basis?
Â Â  . The communication that I have spoken about is designed to deal with the situation that was raised by Mr Staes in his question, that is, focusing on the issues of the retention of water in meat products â in particular in poultry â and the inclusion of hydrolysed protein so as to retain the water in the product.
That is the purpose of this communication.
In relation to the other issue you raised, all I can say is that we currently consider all issues relevant to food safety.
I cannot give you an answer at the moment as to whether the particular point you raised is one of those issues, but it is something that I can deal with.
If you would like to write to me on the subject, I will give you a more detailed response.
Â Â  I should like the Commissioner to tell us two things.
Firstly, is he considering specific limits for the percentage of water which can be added?
I understood that we were looking now at an upper limit of around 20%, instead of the 40% and 50% we sometimes see.
Secondly, does he realise that the perpetrators of this scam said on British television that they have foolproof ways of disguising the fact that protein not of the origin advertised could be added to the product?
Will he ask the EFSA or a similar body to investigate how these methods have continued in the way they have?
They constitute consumer fraud and a public health scandal.
Â Â  . I have to say to Mr Whitehead that I do not approve of the procedure whereby water is retained in a product for the purpose of bulking it out, increasing the weight, so that consumers are misled into believing they are buying more protein than they are actually buying.
It is a clearly misleading practice designed to defraud the consumer.
I do not, therefore, have any ambition to put in place an upper limit for the inclusion of water which, even at 20%, has the effect of misleading the consumer.
On the question of whether this protein can be disguised or not, this is also part of the ongoing work.
But what I am focusing on at the moment is the capacity of the Commission to bring forward a proposal founded on any legal base that may currently exist.
In other words, is there legislation in place at the moment that can be interpreted in such a way as to lead to the banning of this particular activity?
That is the focus of my attention at the moment.
These other issues, as you rightly point out, are of importance also, and we will address them in due course.
Â Â  . The Community is pursuing a coherent and comprehensive tobacco control policy through legislation including contents, packaging and labelling of tobacco products.
Although it has been able to develop robust tobacco legislation, it faces challenges every day, ranging from litigation to the incorrect implementation of provisions of this legislation.
The honourable Member asks whether cardboard covers into which cigarette packets are put in order to hide the health warning, are against the 'spirit of the directive'.
This issue is bound to be considered in the context of implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive.
Article 5 of this directive requires that the content of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields should be printed on the cigarette packet and each unit packet of cigarettes must carry general and additional health warnings covering at least 30% of the front and 40% of the back surface, aimed at informing the consumer about the risks of tobacco use.
One of the main purposes of the Tobacco Products Directive is to alert consumers to the health effects of tobacco use through clear and visible health warnings.
In this respect, the directive provides that these texts must in no way be hidden, obscured or interrupted by other written or pictorial matter or by the opening of the packet.
If the cigarette packet and the cardboard cover are sold separately, it could be argued that this is not in direct contradiction with the provisions of the directive which concerns the sale of tobacco and not the sale of cardboard.
If the cardboard cover is purchased voluntarily by the consumer, this then is an individual decision made by the consumer who has no doubt noticed the texts and the health warnings and, presumably, does not like to see them.
So, in this context the purpose of the directive of informing the consumer about the health effects of tobacco use has been met.
However, where the cardboard is promoted directly or indirectly by the cigarette manufactures themselves and, for example, is given free of charge in tobacco shops, even where it is proposed or sold separately, this might affect the sale of tobacco which falls within the scope of the directive and jeopardise its useful effect.
It could then be seen, as the honourable Member suggests, as going against the spirit of the directive.
The Commission is aware, for instance, that in some cases these cardboard covers are on sale at government-licensed tobacco shops, and brochures advertising them are sent to the tobacco shops by the same distribution companies that bring the tobacco.
It is up to the Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure the correct implementation of the directive.
The Commission urges the national authorities in charge of its implementation to be vigilant in that respect.
The Community has a powerful legal instrument which needs to be implemented correctly.
The Commission will analyse all practical issues emerging from the implementation of the directive and will report to Parliament before the end of 2004.
Â Â  If I have understood the Commissioner correctly, there are two key aspects to this matter, of which one is the potential desire to provide this free packaging when tobacco is sold.
I believe â I am not speaking in my personal capacity but on behalf of several Members, who have waged this fight side by side with the Commissioner throughout the work carried out on this proactive and important directive â that we are talking here about vital issues, and this is something that needs to be said!
Our position is therefore to say that we find it extremely hard to accept this sort of legal fatalism.
Not all being legal specialists but not, equally, being naive, we are fully aware that a legal solution â and we hope that one exists â will be extremely difficult to find.
It is nevertheless also very hard to accept that these small objects, which some people see merely as items of fun but which are completely unacceptable, and which affect and even defeat the object of our directive, are sold in quantity today: 50Â 000 per day and that is only one brand, Commissioner!
This is a fashionable item more or less everywhere in the Member States.
In my question I refer to twelve States, but the problem certainly occurs in all the Member States and the candidate countries.
I therefore believe that some serious legal work needs to be done.
We must find a solution, all the more because the Commission proposes, and we support it in this battle, to go further by including photographs.
These will make the fashion more appealing and will further speed up the process of selling the products and the desire to cover up the reality.
What can we do if that happens?
As to the second aspect, are the manufacturers themselves including this packaging?
In most cases, they are not, but in some, it is the manufacturers of lighters that offer these products, which is not far off.
Â Â  .
I fully agree with the implication of the question you ask and the last part of your question is directed to whether the tobacco industry itself is involved in this, or indeed the retail outlets themselves.
As I indicated earlier, there seems to be some evidence that government-sponsored tobacco shops may be engaged in this exercise.
The extent to which these products may be sold or given free of charge in conjunction with the sale of tobacco is an issue that must be addressed and resolved, particularly in the context of the implementation of the legislation which comes within the powers of the Member States themselves.
However, if there were two completely separate and distinct transactions, one the purchase of cigarettes and the other, in a different shop in another area, the purchase of a package such as this, where an individual is free to do as he wishes with his packet of cigarettes, it seems to me that in such cases, we are reaching the point where regulation becomes more difficult.
But, as I said earlier, the fact remains that the purchaser of the cigarette package will have been aware, and it will have been brought to his notice, that this information is contained on the packet of cigarettes.
The photographs you refer to may also be included, if the Member State in question chooses to print them on the packet of cigarettes, though it is not compulsory to do so, and to that extent information is imparted to the consumer in the way intended by this legislation.
So to that extent the legislation is not circumvented.
But there are issues involved here.
One is to ensure the proper implementation of the legislation and the other is to ensure that we do not intrude upon the freedom of the individual to do whatever he wishes with his own property, even in circumstances where we would not approve of it.
Â Â  .
On 16 July the Commission adopted its proposal on the protection of animals during transport. This amounts to a radical overhaul of the European rules on animal transport.
The Commission is aware that Parliament and some Member States had called for a limitation on journeys of eight hours or 500 kilometres.
However it should be crystal clear from the relevant scientific advice that the Scientific Committee did not recommend specific time limitations for the transport of animals as a tool to improve their welfare.
The Commissionâs proposal takes full account of the opinion of the Scientific Committee and a full range of consultations that took place with stakeholders.
The Commission decided that the best means to give effect to the outcome of this process was to propose travel times that would coincide with the travel and rest rules applicable to drivers.
Consequently, one of my principal aims â the effective enforcement of enhanced animal protection rules â could be achieved in a much more straightforward way.
Tachograph evidence would be used to verify compliance.
I am looking forward to Parliamentâs views on our proposal, as well as speedy progress in the Council.
It would be inappropriate to enter into speculation about any particular scenario in view of the respective roles of our institutions as set out in the Treaty.
Â Â  I am actually somewhat disappointed, because there seems to be a big difference between the rules for drivers of trucks transporting animals all the way to the Middle East, and the conditions that the animals themselves are kept in.
The Commission's scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare concluded that levels of animal welfare drop as journey times increase.
As you mentioned, Commissioner, Parliament's position was eight hours.
With a journey time of nine hours, a rest period of twelve hours, another nine hours of travelling and another twelve hours as a rest period you could just keep on going: you would have a situation where animals could be transported right around the globe and back again. This may continue until the animals are dead.
This is completely unnecessary.
It is quite clear that we are supposed to be striving to create an incentive where the animals will be slaughtered as close as possible to their place of origin.
We must get rid of these excessively long journeys, particularly where animals are being transported to places as far away as the Middle East.
I would hope that the Commission will look again at what it is proposing and come forward with a maximum journey time, rather than this situation where animals can continue to travel long distances with periods of rest.
That is not sufficient to ensure the animals' welfare and the scientists have actually pointed this out.
I would hope that the Commission will take this on board.
In the long term, we must consider the welfare of the animals and create incentives to reduce the need for long-distance transport.
You will not do that, Commissioner, by creating a situation in which it can continue.
Â Â  . I note the honourable Member's comments and note also the fact that she is the shadow rapporteur for the animal transport legislation.
I am also aware of the fact that Parliament has yet to appoint the lead rapporteur â no doubt this will be done very soon.
A report will then be made available in the usual way.
The issue will be presented to the House for discussion, and whatever amendments are tabled will be addressed by the Commission in the usual way.
We shall then be in a position to have a full debate on the issues raised.
In the meantime I have taken note of what the honourable Member has said.
Â Â  In considering this legislation, would you bear in mind that a certain flexibility is certainly desirable?
For example, if you have a rigid nine hours or eight hours with rest periods thereafter, you may be within sight of the ultimate destination.
In such cases, it is certainly better to allow an hour or two extra driving rather than a 12-hour rest period followed by a further one or two hours' driving.
I appeal to you to consider a certain flexibility in the application of any legislation related to animal transport.
Â Â  . I note the point made by MrÂ Purvis, it is a view he has expressed to me before.
This is one of a number of issues being considered by the Presidency in its response to this legislation.
Of course, under the usual procedure that applies to the enactment of legislation, these and other issues will presumably form part of the consideration of the proposal by Parliament and by the Council in the form of amendments designed to find the appropriate way forward.
It is not for me at this stage to present any further proposals, but rather to respond to any amendments that might be tabled by the House or indeed by the Council of Ministers.
Finally, I have noted the point that you have made and no doubt we will discuss it at a later time.
Â Â  I also have concerns about the proposal on animal transport.
The UK currently has a derogation from EU law whereby the export of horses and ponies from the UK to the continent for slaughter is prohibited.
As you know, the UK has a number of semi-wild herds of ponies in the New Forest and Dartmoor.
As I understand it, the proposal on animal transport that you have recently published will force the UK to lift that derogation and allow the export of hundreds, if not thousands, of horses and ponies for slaughter to France, Belgium and Italy.
I think that is an absolutely shocking proposition, given that Britain is a nation of horse-lovers and given the particular cultural values which British people attach to horses and ponies.
Will the Commission be able to support the amendment that I plan to table in the Environment Committee which would allow the UK to prohibit the export of horses and ponies from the UK for slaughter or further fattening?
Â Â  . I am aware of the issues that you raise.
There are, however, some factual errors in the point that you make.
There is no derogation in place at the moment.
The derogation that was in place was removed in 1995.
It would therefore be incorrect to suggest that the current draft legislation under consideration does anything to change the situation from the .
Having said that, this morning I discussed this very issue with your colleague, Mr Parish.
I am aware that there is concern in the UK about the issue.
I have expressed my views on that and I am sensitive to the points that have been made.
Those views will, I understand, achieve some publicity in the press in the UK tomorrow.
I have asked my services to look at this particular point to try and achieve an outcome that you might like, while at the same time ensuring that the rules of the operation of the internal market are not damaged.
So, the issue is under consideration.
Â Â  . I fully share the concerns of the honourable Member on this important question.
Alcohol is one of the most important health determinants in the Community.
I should like to assure you that the Commission, in further developing the Community public health strategy, will also focus on reducing alcohol-related harm.
The Community adopted two important documents on alcohol policy during the Swedish presidency in June 2001. The Council conclusions of 5 June 2001 on a Community strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm, referred to by the honourable Member, and the Council recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people, in particular children and adolescents (2001/458/EC).
One major step in preparing these documents was the Stockholm Conference on Alcohol and Young People in February 2001.
It has to be emphasised that, besides being an important health policy issue, alcohol is also a controversial and politically sensitive issue both at the Community level and in the Member States.
A Community strategy must be carefully planned in co-operation with the Member States.
It must also be evidence based.
Hence we have to assess the different measures as well as the different situations in the Member States.
The adoption of the new public health programme has provided the Commission with an efficient instrument in preparing the strategy.
First, a report on alcohol is going to be completed by the end of 2004 under the health information part of the new programme.
This report will deal with the economic and social costs of alcohol, including issues of promotion of alcohol, protection of children and young people.
Second, hopefully from the beginning of next year, we will create a network of expert organisations to support the implementation of the Council recommendation on the drinking of alcohol by young people, and to develop further a Community strategy on alcohol foreseen in the Council conclusion referred to by the honourable Member.
The Commission has recently created a working party on alcohol and health, where the Member States' representatives discuss different aspects of alcohol policy in the Community and, specifically, how the Member States are implementing the Council recommendation on alcohol and young people.
The working party will also allow us to monitor the situation in the new Member States.
A Commission report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on alcohol and young people is due to be presented at the end of 2005.
This report will consider the extent to which the proposed measures are working effectively and the need for revision or further action.
The Commission is also exploring with the WHO euro-region and the Member States the possibility of holding a conference on alcohol and health in 2005 as a follow up to the Stockholm Conference in 2001.
The results of this conference, together with the report on the application of the Council recommendation on young people and alcohol, will allow us to define the strategy, which will reflect the situation of the larger European Union.
In making progress at Community level, we should not forget the central role of our Member States in tackling these phenomena.
An integrated approach to combating alcohol-related issues needs concerted action by all stakeholders, including families, schools, employers, industry, advertisers and national regulators.
Effective enforcement of existing national legislation on issues ranging from drink-driving to age limits could make a significant difference.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer.
I interpret this as indicating that this work will now be entering a more intensive phase and that it will result in a good many practical measures.
So far, we have unfortunately seen the Commission more readily adopting measures to increase, rather than reduce, consumption.
The latest example was seen as recently as last Monday.
In a so-called justified opinion, the Commission demanded that Sweden repeal its ban on the private import of alcoholic drinks via independent intermediaries, that is to say without the purchaser having to go via the state retailing monopoly.
Through this measure, the ability to monitor the age of purchasers would all but disappear, and it would become considerably more difficult to deduct the correct alcohol tax.
In the light of this, I should like to put a further question to the Commissioner: if we are to formulate a strategy on this important public health problem, would it not be appropriate for different parts of the Commission to work towards the same objective?
Â Â  . The Commission does not have any ambition to increase the consumption of alcohol in the European Union or indeed in the Member States, and nor do its policies seek to achieve that.
As I have indicated to you, the measures that are being undertaken by my Directorate-General and by others in the Commission, seek to achieve a situation whereby there will be a reduction of binge drinking in particular, especially among young people.
This phenomenon exists in a number of Member States, not all Member States.
It is, however, an issue for the Member States themselves. It is a national competence issue and it would be wrong to look to the policies of the European Union either to encourage or discourage alcohol consumption.
We can only act in the light of the competences that are available to us at European Union level: this issue is the primary responsibility of each individual Member State, and some Member States have a bigger problem than others.
Those Member States that have a bigger problem should ensure that they put in place policies at national level to try to resolve this situation.
Â Â  . I thank the honourable Member for raising this important subject and affording me the opportunity to outline the Commissionâs thinking on the matter.
The honourable Member currently refers in her question to the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare concerning welfare aspects of the production of foie gras in ducks and geese.
This report was adopted in December 1998 and covers a wide range of issues including : the origins and distribution of foie gras production; the practice of rearing and force-feeding: the behaviour of ducks and geese; the consequences of force-feeding, in particular welfare indicators; socio-economic aspects of improving the welfare of animals used in the foie gras industry; and research.
The scientists did not look at the issue of force-feeding in isolation, but as part of the full range of factors involved in producing foie gras.
Nevertheless, in recognising that force-feeding of birds, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds, the Scientific Committee went on to make a number of recommendations.
The main aim of the recommendations is to improve production practices so that avoidable suffering can be mitigated.
Thus, according to the scientists, the objectives would be, in order of priority: to reduce mortality and morbidity rates; to decrease the amounts of pain and distress that all endure in the process; and to allow the animals to engage in normal behavioural activities.
The report makes clear that it is very important for the further development of foie gras production to introduce alternative techniques that do not require force-feeding in an intensive way.
My services have drawn the attention of the industry to this report.
As a consequence, the industry is studying and researching better production techniques that are more welfare-friendly.
In addition, I would like to draw to the honourable Memberâs attention the two recommendations in the framework of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes.
They concern specifically the protection of ducks and geese kept for the production of foie gras.
I am pleased to say that the Commission actively participated in the adoption of the recommendations.
These recommendations provide for welfare considerations for the breeding of ducks and geese and, in particular, for the phasing out of small individual cages for ducks.
The recommendations reflect the necessity to reduce the most intensive form of farming, as recommended in the report of the Scientific Committee to which I have already referred.
The Community, all Member States, and most of the acceding countries are party to this Convention and, as such, are expected to give effect to the recommendations.
In particular, parties to the Convention will have to report the status of the implementation of these particular recommendations to the Council of Europe after 1 January 2005.
The Commission will closely follow the implementation of these recommendations, which provide for significant welfare improvements.
Â Â  Commissioner, thank you for that response.
As I am sure you know, this is an issue of great concern to a lot of people across the European Union, and they will want to know that we are tackling it with a great degree of urgency.
I would like to bring to your attention Council Directive 98/58/EC â the general farm animal welfare directive â which states that 'no animal shall be provided with food or liquid in a manner (...) which may cause unnecessary suffering or injury'.
Given that the mechanical force-feeding of ducks and geese does exactly that, will the Commission please state whether it is satisfied with the application of Directive 98/58/EC in France and Belgium in particular?
Directive 98/58/EC also allows for Community measures to ensure the uniform application of Council of Europe recommendations.
Given that Germany and Denmark, together with Poland, have already prohibited force-feeding, will the Commission now come forward and propose an outright ban on so as to harmonise EU legislation in this area?
Â Â  . All the scientific advice I receive in relation to this issue focuses on the manner in which the force-feeding takes place, that is, the circumstances surrounding the force-feeding.
Whether the birds are kept in cages, for instance, and the other circumstances and conditions in which the birds are kept.
It is important to emphasise that there is no scientific advice available to us to the effect that the force-feeding itself, as distinct from the conditions under which the animals are kept, is contrary to animal welfare.
That is the clear advice I have in relation to this issue, and I give that response to you for your consideration.
In those circumstances, I am satisfied that Directive 98/58 is being properly implemented.
Â Â  I believe the Commissioner is wrong about force-feeding itself not causing unnecessary suffering or injury and not being in breach of the directive on farm animals, as Mrs Lucas mentioned.
If you stick a funnel down a goose's throat and force-feed it with maize, there is no way that you are not causing suffering or injury.
It is ludicrous to suggest that it is not causing injury.
Secondly, the Israeli supreme court has actually ruled that force-feeding is illegal â and that in a country where they had quite a large production of through force-feeding.
Other countries too have ruled that it is illegal.
The European Union should do the same.
You are denying the reality of the situation if you say that force-feeding does not cause unnecessary suffering or injury.
Looking at the directive, as Mrs Lucas has said, the only thing we can do is impose a ban on this type of feeding of animals.
Â Â  . The clear advice that I have in relation to this issue is that the traditional methods of feeding ducks and geese for the production of foie gras are not contrary to animal welfare considerations.
The real issue for concern, and the focus of attention of all the scientific evaluation on this issue, has been related to the intensive farming, intensive production and the intensive force-feeding of the birds in that way.
The ban you mention is not on a welfare basis but rather on an ethical basis, which is a different issue.
What we are considering here is the question of animal welfare and the treatment of animals and birds in these circumstances.
I take note of what you have said.
This is an issue that will be discussed at a future time.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your cooperation with Parliament this afternoon, Mr Byrne.
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions Nos 42, 43 and 44 will be replied to in writing.
We will move on to questions to Mr Bolkestein.
Â Â  . The Commission would like to start by clearing up a misunderstanding that seems to underlie this question.
At present there is no decision and no agreement.
There is therefore nothing to abrogate.
There is an American law which requires airlines flying to or from the United States to provide access to their passenger name records. Most airlines are complying with this.
That is understandable in view of the fact that there may be negative consequences for these airlines and for their passengers if they do not supply the data to the United States.
February's joint statement brought with it a US commitment to work with the Commission towards achieving a so-called adequacy finding regarding the level of data protection provided by the United States.
The honourable Member is right, the Commission does not consider that the American arrangements amount to adequate protection.
That in itself is not yet a reason to stop the process.
Instead, the Commission is energetically pursuing the process with the aim of persuading the United States to improve its arrangements so that an adequacy finding can be made and a proper legal framework for passenger name record transfers can be provided.
The Commission, as I told Parliament's relevant committee on 9 September 2003, is working to a deadline of Christmas 2003.
Â Â  I fear that the Commissioner's âunderstandableâ is worse than an agreement.
In other words, what we have here are tolerance and the concealed assent of the Commission, and Commissioner Bolkestein in particular, to an infringement of the legislation of the European Union, especially the directives on data protection.
Consequently, Commissioner, my question is: have you taken account of the resolution passed by the European Parliament's plenary a few weeks ago on combating this situation?
This resolution includes the European Parliament's concern that it could take recourse to the court against this stand by the Commission on this specific issue, which is a terribly sensitive issue on which the Commission is acting illegally, while the institutions of the European Union are trying to teach its citizens to act legally.
Â Â  . In reply to the supplementary question, perhaps I may once again explain that the Commission is in active negotiations with the Government of the United States.
I was in Washington early last week, and during my stay I had discussions with Mr Tom Ridge who is the Secretary for the Homeland Security Department, in other words the man in charge of seeing to it that the United States is a secure and safe country.
The legislation of the United States requires all passengers going to the United States to have their personal data sent on before their arrival.
Quite apart from what the Commission thinks, airlines and, where necessary, computerised reservation systems, supply that data.
That is not strictly in compliance with European law and, therefore, the situation is not good.
European law is laid down in the Data Protection Directive which, incidentally, has not yet been transposed into the national legislations of a number of Member States.
Anyway, it is a directive and should be policed by Member States, not by the Commission.
Once again, this is not a good situation.
We need to decide whether there is adequate protection of the data in the United States, that is the so-called 'adequacy finding'.
As I told the relevant parliamentary committee in the first half of September, I cannot as yet conclude that there is adequacy on the other side of the ocean.
Therefore the legally precarious situation continues to exist.
Once again that is not good.
The honourable Member said that there was a secret arrangement.
There is nothing secret about anything at all.
The situation is of doubtful legality, but the Commission is in discussions with the American Government to try and rectify.
On my last visit to Washington I managed to achieve some limited progress towards an agreed solution, but we are still very far apart.
I said to Parliament that I set a deadline of Christmas to resolve this situation.
What will happen I do not know.
Hopefully, we shall reach an adequacy finding later on during the near because our negotiations continue.
If that is not the case, I shall tell Parliament that there is no adequacy and, therefore, propose that we engage in a bilateral negotiation with the United States.
That would, of necessity, amount to a derogation from the data protection directive.
There is also another legal instrument in the form of the computerised reservation system regulation.
That is a regulation and, therefore, the policing of that regulation is in the hands of the Commission. My colleague Mrs De Palacio is more specifically responsible for that.
Articles 6 and 11 of the regulation say that the Commission may be required to stop data flow if that data flow is not compatible with the regulation.
But may I draw the attention of honourable Members to the fact that stopping the data flow, as I said earlier, may have dire consequences for the airlines involved.
It may mean that all passengers have to queue up for three or four hours in Washington, New York or wherever in order to give the data required by the Americans, or that airlines are fined so many dollars per passenger or their landing rights actually suspended.
These are no mean consequences, and I would remind the honourable Member of the possible consequences that stopping of the data flow would have.
Having said that I understand Parliament's concerns.
They are my concerns because I am interested in upholding the law.
We are working to that end.
I was in Washington last week.
We shall continue and I shall report to Parliament as soon as I have something more substantial than at this moment on how far our American partners are prepared to go.
Â Â  . In answer Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen's question, I should like to point out that a parallel importation of a medicinal product is a legal form of trade within the internal market, based on Article 28 of the Treaty.
It is also subject to the derogations regarding the protection of human health and life and also the protection of industrial and commercial property, provided by Article 30 of the Treaty.
The European Court of Justice has ruled that the derogation to the free movement of goods, justified on the grounds of protection of industrial and commercial property, is only admissible for the purpose of safeguarding rights that constitute the specific subject matter of the property.
The specific point of a trademark is, in particular, to guarantee to the owner that he has the exclusive right to use that trademark for the purpose of putting a product on the market for the first time.
Accordingly, Member State legislation protecting industrial and commercial property rights may not be used to oppose the importation of a product that has already been lawfully placed on the market in another Member State by, or with the consent of, the proprietor of that right.
In certain circumstances parallel importers are forced to relabel parallel imported medicinal products in order to have effective access to the market of the importing Member State, especially when the use of different trademarks by the proprietor contributes to the artificial partitioning of the markets between Member States.
Partitioning of the markets would still exist if the importer were only able to sell the product in parts of his market.
The court has ruled that repackaging and relabelling is not necessary if the parallel importer merely wishes to secure a commercial advantage.
According to the jurisprudence of the court, relabelling is considered justified if it is objectively necessary.
In any case, this is to be assessed on the basis of circumstances such as those mentioned in the question â circumstances prevailing at the time of the marketing of the parallel imported medicinal product in the importing Member State.
It is for the national courts to determine in each specific case whether it is objectively necessary for the parallel importer to use the trademark used in the Member State of import to enable the imported products to have effective access to the market.
As regards the national measures mentioned in the question, should more information on the specific circumstances become available to the Commission, these special circumstances will be assessed in the light of the jurisprudence of the court.
Â Â  My understanding of what you said is that, if I can obtain more information on this specific case, I can come to you to resolve it or refer the matter to a national court.
These are the two solutions.
Â Â  . If Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen has more specific details concerning any particular case that has come to her attention, the Commission would very much like to learn of it and will follow it up in the light of the case-law of the courts with the appropriate action.
The Commission will be grateful to Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen for bringing those circumstances to its notice.
Â Â  . The Commission has investigated the complaints it received in connection with the public service contracts awarded by the company Trasagua and has come to the conclusion that this entity must be regarded as a public law body within the meaning of the community directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public service contracts.
The Commission therefore takes the view that the provisions of the public service contract directives are applicable to this entity when it awards a contract falling within the scope of these directives and that the environmental impact assessment contract referred to by the honourable Member should have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
In a letter to me dated 19 June 2003 Mr Martinez Fernandez, State Secretary for Coastline and Waterways in the Spanish Environment Ministry, acknowledges that this analysis of the Commission is correct.
And in the same letter he gives the undertaking that from now on the company Trasagua will apply the relevant provisions of the EC directives in full whenever it awards contracts.
The Commission wishes to draw the attention of the honourable Member to the fact that the Trasagua case must be placed in the broader context of the compatibility of the Spanish provisions for the implementation of the community concept of public law body.
The Spanish Act under which the public service contract directives are implemented does after all exclude private entities from its scope, even if they conform to the definition of public law body within the meaning of the community directives.
In this context the Commission has on various occasions taken action under Article 226 for failure to fulfil obligations.
The Court of Justice for example recently found Spain guilty of the incorrect application of the directive on working on the construction of a prison.
Another case relating to the more general problem of the incorrect implementation of the personnel scope of the directives concerning the coordination of the procedures for the award of public works contracts and of public supply contracts has still to come before the Court.
In addition, on 11 July of this year the Commission decided to declare Spain in default on the same grounds in relation to Directive 92/50/EEC concerning the coordination of procedures for the award of public service contracts.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his clear response.
I am also pleased with the reply he has given, namely that the Commission has declared Spain to be in default by reason of inadequate compliance with the directive on government spending.
This is of such importance because this is not the first problem in the case of the Spanish Hydrological Plan, the and it will not be the last.
The fact is that this plan is enormous and requires a great deal of government funds, also government funds from the Commission, for which an application has been submitted but which, fortunately, has not yet been granted.
I should like to urge the Commissioner to continue to act with the severity he has shown in this specific case, because it is important, in my view, for Spain to realise that it must comply with European legislation in every particular, not only as regards environmental impact assessments, but also where government tendering is concerned, particularly in this case.
Â Â  . The Commission would like to thank Mr Karas for his questions, which are important and detailed.
The Commission services are preparing a proposal for a directive on the capital adequacy of banks and investment firms.
As Parliament will be aware, the Basel Committee has announced a short delay in its timetable in reaching agreement on the new Basel Accord. The accord should now be finalised by the middle of 2004 at the latest.
The Commission's proposal should be made very shortly thereafter.
Implementation at the end of 2006 remains a challenging but achievable task.
The Commission services remain firmly on track in the development of a proposal for an EU directive.
That draft proposal is broadly consistent with the work done by the Basel Committee, but appropriately differentiated, where necessary, to take account of the specificities of the EU context as supported by the European Parliament.
Regarding Mr Karas' fourth question, let me confirm that the results of the study on the consequences of the new framework on the European economy â especially SMEs â will be available in due time to inform the EU legislature.
The technical details of the draft directive are still subject to reflection and consultation within the Commission, but I am pleased to provide you now with the following elements in response to the questions raised by Mr Karas.
First, with regard to his question on retail loans, the draft directive should indeed allow a wide use of comitology procedures to make necessary changes in the light of market developments, including inflation adjustments.
With regard to his second question, the Commission services' third consultative paper â the so-called CP3 of 1 July 2003 â no longer refers to a specific granularity criterion to distinguish retail from corporate loan portfolios.
With respect to questions 3, 7 and 8 on banks' internal rating systems, the draft proposals do not spell out how banks should develop their rating systems and which risk factors they should take into account.
As is currently the case, banks are only required to take into account all relevant available information when they assess the credit quality of their borrowers, including any investments and research activities a potential borrower has undertaken or plans to make.
This is not new and should be expected of any bank.
Irrespective of that, the Commission services have started a project to examine ways of promoting the use of rating systems that include technology risk assessments â in other words, technology ratings â to enable potential investors to appraise the specific risks and rewards associated with investments in technology-based SMEs.
But, if a bank wants to use its internal ratings for regulatory capital purposes, its supervisor will need in future to check the reliability of the bank's rating system.
That will improve the quality of the systems and ratings and is in the interest of all parties involved.
On question 5 it is important for the Commission that the new rules are appropriate for all types and sizes of institutions, especially small banks.
Work in Basel and Brussels reflects this in numerous areas, for example by allowing a partial use of methodologies to avoid unnecessary burdens for small credit institutions.
Finally, on question 6, a broader range of collateral is already recognised in connection with significant improvements for loans to SMEs.
At this stage, both the Commission and the Member States' supervisory authorities believe that a further recognition of collateral and the destandardised approach would not be justified on prudential grounds.
The Commission services are pursuing a solution for covered bonds which appropriately reflects the risk of these instruments.
I apologise for having been so detailed, Mr President, but the questions were also detailed and I wanted to reply in a similar vein.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Bolkestein, I would like to thank you for your detailed reply.
I note â if I understood you correctly â that the Commission will, in its proposal for a directive, consider all of the points and demands I made in my questionÂ âÂ with the exception of the area of collateral, where the process for forming an opinion has not yet been concluded.
I would like to ask you, therefore, what consequences will result from postponing the timetable for the Basel Committee to make a decision?
You say that you will submit your draft directive immediately afterwards; in that case, it is likely to be autumn 2004 and that leaves a relatively tight timeframe for debates in Parliament and with the Council and a very tight timeframe for a preparatory phase for businesses before it enters into force at the end of 2006.
What are the consequences of the new agreement in the Basel Committee and the fact that the timetable has been put back by almost a year because of the Committeeâs hesitancy?
Â Â  . The Commission, as MrÂ Karas knows, is keen to stick to the original timetable.
It is true that differing opinions on the other side of the ocean with respect to expected loss and unexpected loss have caused a small postponement of a few months.
This means that the Commission will not finalise its proposal until around the middle of next year.
It will be hard work to get everything ready for implementation at the end of 2006.
The Commission does its best to keep pace with the developments in Basel.
The Commission is not a Member of the Basel Committee; it is an observer and therefore in the hands of the Basel Committee as far as progress in that matter is concerned.
However, it does its best to get everything ready on time.
Mr Karas' main question is whether the Commission will take note of the matter he has raised, and of course the Commission will.
Mr Karas can be assured that his opinions and questions will be taken into account.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, the case that Parliament completed the study a long time ago, and our conclusion from it is that we urgently need a training programme.
We had already considered something to this effect in the Committee on Budgets and earmarked EURÂ 6 million in the budget for training related to BaselÂ II.
Furthermore, we have a pilot projectÂ âÂ which we hope to be able to vote in favour of on ThursdayÂ âÂ of EURÂ 91 million for building up collateral, because ultimately collateral must be built up in order to obtain a credit rating.
I would be interested in knowing if it would still be possible for us to incorporate into the Commission study how we can best equip the training programme and how we could optimise the preparations for the introduction of BaselÂ II in the pilot project together with the European Investment Bank and other European banks.
Â Â  . The Commission is of the opinion that training programmes are important and is therefore most attentive to what Parliament decides and wishes to do in that area.
Whether the training programmes as such will be part of the proposal to be finalised around the summer of next year, I do not know.
After all, the training programme is one thing and the directive is something else.
But certainly the Commission is more than willing to cooperate by giving Mr RÃŒbig the benefit of its experience in carrying out training activities and if he would care to send a letter me along those lines, then I shall be at pains to see to it that the matter is dealt with in an adequate fashion.
Â Â  . The Commission would like to recall that the public procurement directive applicable to public works was transposed into Greek law in the mid-nineties and constitutes the appropriate framework for the award of public works contracts in Greece.
Notwithstanding the fact that the relevant EU rules seem to have been correctly transposed, the Commission examines specific cases of potential irregularities in the award of public works and work concessions, which are brought to its attention and evaluates on a case-by-case basis whether or not Community law has been breached.
Concerning the specific question of certain public works studies, the Commission can confirm that, in the course of a regularly scheduled on-the-spot control mission concerning the Egnatia project, which is co-financed by the EU, in particular through the Trans-European Network â TEN-T â and the Structural Funds, some issues have been identified which show that the practices in Greece for the award of study contracts may not be compatible with public procurement rules and thus require further clarification.
The Commission is in close contact with the Greek authorities in order to assess these issues.
Whilst awaiting the outcome of the compatibility assessment under the public procurement rules, and in application of the 'precautionary principle', some of the payments, namely those linked to the TEN-T budget line, have been suspended.
Should the competent Greek authorities not provide sufficient evidence of the compatibility of national rules or practices with the Community legislation on public procurement, the Commission will have to open an infringement procedure and thus all the EU funds concerned will have to be suspended.
As for the last question, the Commission is not currently examining any case related to the concession of public works, nor have there been any complaints on this specific issue to date.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for the detailed reply which he has given to my question.
I should like to ask him if, apart from the Egnatia Road, there are other projects which are subject to controls at the moment.
Â Â  . At this moment I cannot answer the last question.
Apart from the Egnatia case, none have been brought to my notice.
But that does not mean that no cases are being looked into â they have simply not been brought to my notice.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your excellent cooperation beyond the agreed time limit.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 50 to 103 will be replied to in writing(6).
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0346/2003) by Mr Rothley, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles (COM(2002) 244 â C5-0269/2002 â 2002/0124(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the floor on this important subject.
May I begin by thanking MrRothley, the rapporteur on this important file, most heartily for his excellent work.
Let me furthermore stress that the area of motor insurance is a very good example of efficient co-operation between Parliament and the Commission.
As honourable Members know, the European Parliament resolution of October 1995 â that is precisely eight years ago â gave rise to the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive.
Another resolution, this time of July 2001, recommended the adoption of a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive very much along the lines of the current Commission proposal.
I should like to thank the Parliament, and particularly Mr Rothley, for their approach.
The proposal for a Fifth Motor Insurance Directive aims at introducing legislation which would affect millions of European citizens: drivers and potential victims of accidents and, of course, insurers.
It will make it easier for drivers to get insurance and improve the protection of victims.
As you know the aim of this proposal is not only to update and modernise the existing rules but also to reinforce the single insurance market in the area of motor insurance.
Some aspects of the directives adopted in the 1970s and the 1980s need to be updated, in particular concerning the minimum amount of insurance cover.
There is also a need to fill gaps and provide solutions to real problems experienced by our citizens.
Furthermore, the procedure set up in the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive for an efficient and quick settlement of accidents taking place outside the victim's MemberÂ State of residence should be extended to any motor accident.
I am now looking forward to comments from honourable Members.
Then, if you allow, I shall respond to Parliament's amendments in some detail.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Bolkestein, thank you for your kind words, which I can only acknowledge.
In this area of insurance law and protection for victims of accidents there is in fact excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament and I thank you for that.
With the Fifth Directive we are consistently continuing to protect victims of accidents following on from the Fourth Directive.
It would perhaps be sensible, MrÂ Bolkestein, if you did not go into individual amendments in the debate, as we will still, in any case, have to discuss them with the Council.
I would like to make a few points to clarify the content.
I will begin first of all with the issue of jurisdiction.
On this issue the Fifth Directive rounds off the Fourth very well indeed.
With the Fourth Directive we made it possible for accidents in another country to be settled in the country of residence.
After the Fourth Directive was passed there was, on 22 December 2000, the regulation onjurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.
Provision is made there so that with civil liability insurance the domicile of the injured party can be considered a place of jurisdiction when there is a direct claim.
This was made possible for accidents in another country in the Fourth Directive and with the fifth this applies to all accidents.
This means that it will not only be possible to settle out of court in oneâs own country a claim arising in another, but it will also be possible to begin a legal battle in oneâs own.
We cannot do more than that for the victims of accidents.
What else does this Fifth Directive contain?
The costs of judicial proceedings that are deemed to be necessary and appropriate will be reimbursed.
When the cost of legal proceedingsÂ âÂ for example consultation with a lawyerÂ âÂ are deemed necessary and appropriate, then that is a claim that must be compensated.
We must increase the minimum sum.
There is a somewhat piecemeal system in the European Union in this area and everybody agrees that, after twenty years, a new provision is needed.
Now, it is a question of the amount and there are, of course, problems with this.
It is not exactly easyÂ âÂ and I know this only too wellÂ âÂ to raise the minimum sum because that obviously also causes an increase in premiums.
The compromise that we came toÂ âÂ EURÂ 5 million for personal injuries and EURÂ 2 million for damage to propertyÂ âÂ is a compromise, with which I think the insurance markets can cope.
Incidentally, there is one aspect regarding the minimum sum that must not be overlooked, that is to say, adequately protecting those victims of accidents that are the most affected.
Everything in me rebels against the idea that a 20-year-old, paralysed after an accident, is left dependent on social security after 20 years, and in the meantime the injuring party, who is infinitely liable, is also financially ruined.
This compromise does, therefore, actually make sense.
We are creating a provision for trailers on motor vehicles.
There is a mention of this in an earlier directive, but there are completely different provisions across the European Union.
Often the trailerâs registration number is known but not that of the motor vehicle, and then it is very difficult to settle a claim.
I would like to mention two further points CommissionerÂ Bolkestein, which we did not accept in your proposal: Firstly, the person responsible for the settlement of claims taking charge of the provisions of the Green Card Bureaux.
We should not carry out this amalgamation, which is superfluous; it damages a system that works, which is what the Green Card Bureaux is.
We also dispensed with the provision on the protection of vulnerable travellers; that means making provision for civil liability.
That is a very specific problem, and we should work togetherÂ âÂ the Commission and ParliamentÂ âÂ in order to tackle this issue of liability in another directive.
On the wholeÂ âÂ and I am coming back to where I beganÂ âÂ the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission has been so excellent because we held a European dialogue at European level on all of these issues, between insurers, automobile associations, Parliament, and associations of accident victimsÂ âÂ I am referring here to the European Transport Law Seminars in Trier.
It is precisely because we worked extremely hard in this area and discussed a great deal that we can also find solutions together that will help the victims of accidents.
I am confident that in further discussions with the Council we will quickly achieve a result.
On the whole, it all helps to take us forward and above all: it encourages us to have a European dialogue because when we do have such a dialogue then solutions are easier.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in actual fact, I am taking the floor as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to acknowledge the work done by the vice-chairman, Mr Rothley.
This proposal for a directive has been developed with great tenacity and intelligence by Mr Rothley, and I want to give him credit for it here.
We are particularly grateful to him because this directive has come about as a result of Article 192, for which I have a particular fondness, as it is an indirect legislative initiative which gives Parliament a leading role and which also confirms the right of initiative of Parliament and its Members.
In such a sensitive industry, this leads to more effective European citizenship because, as Mr Rothley has said, it makes it easier to take out a short-term policy for a temporary stay in another Member State and to get short-term insurance for a vehicle purchased outside the ownerâs Member State of residence.
As a result, it will be simpler to purchase a car in any country in the Union where the best terms are available.
I think this will be of interest to a great many European citizens, because of that single insurance market that Mr Bolkestein was talking about and which is thus established, and it will be a valuable and useful development for the European Community as a whole.
The most sensitive part of the report â it has already been underlined, but I should like to reiterate it â concerns the higher levels of cover laid down by the Member States.
The Commission had set a sum of EUR 1 million per victim in cases of personal injury and EUR 500Â 000 per accident for damage to property.
We believe EUR 5 million per accident for personal injury and EUR 2 million for property damage would be more appropriate and flexible and could be a compromise position.
I must formally give Mr Rothley the credit for this compromise, because he has taken into account the various situations that exist in the insurance market, once again with a view to achieving a single insurance market.
He has also addressed the issue of legal costs.
It was not appropriate at this stage, however, to extend insurance cover to injuries sustained by pedestrians and cyclists as a result of accidents in which they were involved, because this is an even more sensitive area and I think it may need to be regulated by a specific measure.
If, as Mr Bolkestein has recognised, Parliament and the Commission have worked well and usefully together, I hope that the Council and the Commission will take our amendments to heart and that such an important directive as this will be able to help to bring the citizens of Europe closer together in common citizenship.
I very much hope this will happen, because the compromise that has been reached is an excellent balance, which I hope the Commission will take into account.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your clarification and thank you, Mr Rothley, for this proposal with which you have made another contribution to the further completion of the internal market.
We know it is a slow, but steady process.
Even if it takes twenty years before the fourth directive is followed by a fifth one, we will get there in the end.
I have confidence in this.
You, Commissioner, are well on your way to achieving it, and I hope that eventually, we will reach this optimal position.
Insurance law is also complex in this case.
I myself am a personal injury lawyer and have myself sustained personal injury in the past.
This has probably given me the opportunity of working here.
It is of extreme importance for this legislation to be transportable to your country of residence, because as the injured party, you often face a great many problems with the various legal systems.
So, as far as that is concerned, I am very pleased with the proposal as it is now before us.
I think that the insurance companies are also delighted with a further harmonisation, which affords them, too, more clarity.
We set up a green card system some time ago, and this takes it further within the EU.
The minimum amounts proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market struck me as being very high, because these rarely come into play in practice, if at all.
I am therefore actually more pleased with Mr Rothleyâs compromise proposals, for they are more geared towards the market as it is in reality.
The amounts should not be too high either, because, I believe, enforceability would then become an issue.
Nobody benefits from legislation that is not enforceable.
I would like to state once again, therefore, that this proposal is closer to reality than the extremely high amounts initially formulated.
Then again, the Commissionâs proposals are a little on the low side, and I think that what Mr Rothley has proposed is ideal.
We Liberals can give our warm support to this proposal.
On a different note, in an amendment, I had requested more harmonisation in the discussion of personal injury, in terms of the level of invalidity or the level of the value of the injury.
I gather from Mr Rothley that a follow-up report on this is already in the making.
I think that we are making another contribution to the internal marketâs completion, for which I am grateful.
It will receive my unqualified support.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, it is a sad fact, but we must face up to the reality that there are far too many drivers on our roads without sufficient insurance.
The occurrences of personal injury and damage to property are all too frequent, despite the best efforts of our various national safety councils to reduce such tragedies.
I commend the rapporteur for his work on this technical subject and agree fully that an appropriate level of insurance cover should also meet the cost of legal proceedings.
These are essential, and it is appropriate that they be treated as damages to be covered by the compulsory civil liability.
The conflict of interest that arises if the party's own insurers or their opponent's carry out the settlement is self-evident.
I support the Commission's proposal that the amount of the minimum sum insured in the case of the personal injuries arising from an accident should be unlimited.
Accident victims with very severe injuries such as paraplegia would not receive sufficient cover with a maximum sum of EUR 1 million.
I agree that it makes sense not only to provide cover for the severest cases at EUR 10 million but to limit cover to that amount for each accident.
It ought to be extremely rare for two or more cases of severe injuries to occur in a single accident.
Mr Rothley is to be complimented once again on his wisdom and competence.
The fact that accidents in different countries can now be dealt with in the country of the injured person is a huge plus, and I congratulate the rapporteur once again.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, we all agree that this directive is important because it is important for European motorists and victims of accidents.
Why is it important?
Firstly, because it will lead to the judicial protection of victims being updated and improved; secondly, it creates a better functioning internal market for motor vehicle liability insurance; thirdly, the minimum insurance sums for personal injuries and damage to property are increased; fourthly, because it will mean that it is easier to comply with insurance liability for imported motor vehicles until they reach their destination, and fifthly because it clarifies the responsibility of the guarantee fund in the country where the accident occurred for all accidents involving motor vehicles without registration plates or with false registration plates.
During the debate I had three main requests.
My first request was the minimum cover sum for personal injuries and damage to property and this was taken into account in the amendment and at the same time this amounted to a transition period of five years, which is exactly what I had in mind.
My second request was for the removal of the insertion in Article 4(2) of the Commission proposal, because I, like many in this House, believe that a directive on insurance law should not deal with any issues that are the responsibility of national civil law.
My third main request was directed against the unnecessary bureaucracy and unnecessary additional costs, which means that we advocated that, when a contractual relationship ends, the policyholder can ask for a statement relating to any claims to be forwarded, so that this is not sent automatically.
This change was implemented by Mr Harbourâs amendment.
I can, therefore, only welcome this directive.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mr Rothley very much, not just for this report but for the sustained campaign that he has run over many years, as the Commissioner indicated, to improve the whole insurance climate for Europe's motorists.
I think he deserves a lot of credit for that, and it reflects well on Parliament too.
Since I joined the Parliament in 1999, I have had the pleasure of working with Mr Rothley on this subject in which I have taken a particular interest.
I contributed to the 2001 report and am delighted to say that a number of the ideas that flowed from that are now incorporated in this very welcome Fifth proposal from the Commission.
Mr Rothley and others have talked particularly about issues of improving the ability of motorists to claim damages for accidents outside their own country.
I want to focus on a few other detailed points.
Many of us have dealt with constituency cases concerning the difficulties of people temporarily moving to other countries â particularly students or people taking up work or even citizens wishing to make long-term stays.
They have difficulty in getting their insurance extended for that temporary stay and having insurance extended for up to 12 months.
I think this is a very important benefit.
Secondly, we are concerned in our committee about the internal market and simplifying the regime which allows citizens to go and buy a car from another country and have their existing insurance extended for 30 days while they bring that car home and have it re-registered.
This is just an important simplification.
It underlines the fact that in the internal market, citizens expect to be able to have these rights delivered across borders without inconvenience â that is really what this proposal is all about.
In a similar vein, making insurance purchase easier and more competitive, by enabling citizens to get their insurance claim records delivered to them wherever they have had insurance previously, so that they can use their past clean record to gain important price and coverage benefits for their insurance is an important benefit.
In conclusion, Mr Karas has talked about some of the improvements we have made, and I agree with him about some of the areas into which I think we have intruded too far into Member States' prerogatives.
One area which has been drawn to my attention in the last few days is the right for claims to lapse after four years.
In my own country, the United Kingdom, that cuts across national provisions.
There are strong arguments for having a look at this again and this is something I will talk to the rapporteur about.
We need to discuss whether we should support that provision in the final report or ask the Commission and Council to look at this before it finally comes back.
Overall this is an excellent piece of work.
It has our full support, and I would like to thank both the Commission and the rapporteur for the work they have done in moving this important benefit forward for all of Europe's citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the internal insurance market has to be completed and the barriers that still exist in the industry removed.
It is no coincidence that the European Parliament has called on the Commission to submit a proposal to bring motor insurance rules up to date so that the right of European Union citizens to live, travel and work in any Member State of the Union without any problem may become a reality.
The draft fifth directive on civil liability motor insurance will certainly have the effect of modernising and improving European rules in this sector.
Above all, it will be easier to take out a short-term policy covering a temporary stay in another Member State and getting short-term insurance for a vehicle purchased outside the ownerâs Member State of residence.
Consumers will thus find it easier to purchase a car in any country in the Union where the best terms are available, and that will help to stimulate cross-border competition.
In addition, the directive seeks to update the limits on the minimum cover that should be enjoyed by motorists.
This will allow motorists to change their insurance more quickly.
Another objective is to improve protection for pedestrians involved in accidents.
Lastly, the directive allows citizens to obtain a statement from their current insurers regarding the accidents in which they have been involved so that they can negotiate a new contract with another insurer.
It is essential to avoid setting the minimum cover at levels that are too high and beyond any reasonable need.
If this were to happen, the cost would inevitably be passed on to the consumer through considerable rises in insurance premiums.
The effects would be felt especially badly in certain countries, including Italy, where increased premiums are already giving rise to a particularly heated debate.
Not to mention the new countries joining the Union, where the citizens and the insurance companies would be called on to meet costs out of all proportion to their economic levels.
My assessment of the proposal is therefore positive; we must be careful, however, not to go too far and produce results that are counterproductive for those same citizens whom we wish to protect and help.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is excellent that the report drafted by Mr Rothely received unanimous or quasi-unanimous support in this Parliament.
It is often said that the distance between the European Union and the citizens of the Member States is too wide.
This is an issue which is to the direct benefit of the citizens of Europe and it goes to show that the distances are not as great as is sometimes stated.
That is another reason why the Commission is extremely happy with this report.
The various speakers have also thanked the Commission.
If the Commission has contributed to the report, it did so out of the conviction that this is the way to go.
And so, my thanks to all.
Mr Rothley has said that it is not necessary to reply and give the Commission's opinion on each of the amendments because the discussion will continue.
Nevertheless I have comments here and, if you agree, I shall forward them to the Parliament's services for everyone to see.(1)
Finally, no specific questions have been put to the Commission, so at this moment at least there is not much to answer.
The Commission is extremely happy with the way things are proceeding and intends to continue the excellent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament which has marked out this dossier since its inception.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0334/2003) by Mrs Smet, on behalf of the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities, on violations of women's rights and the EU's international relations (2002/2286(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we are fully aware of the way in which womenâs rights are violated around the world.
When they are, it is on the basis of a number of values, including tradition, social cohesion or the honour of the male members of a family.
Genital mutilation of women is seen as upholding this tradition.
Murder or mutilation for reasons of honour are seen as a way of maintaining peace within society, and the public stoning or chastising of women is condoned in the context of maintaining the social order.
Fortunately, the international community is increasingly showing its dissatisfaction with this situation, as is illustrated by the reaction to the stoning of Amina Lawal, the admittedly late reaction to the Taliban regime and the persistent questions about the death of photo journalist Zahra Kazemi in Iran.
At the same time, campaigns for womenâs rights are receiving recognition.
The award of the Nobel Prize to Shirin Ebadi, the womenâs and childrenâs activist in Iran, is also an extremely important signal, as was this afternoonâs statement of Senegalâs President Wade in this Chamber.
President Wade made express reference to his fight against the genital mutilation of women.
The question we have to ask ourselves is whether Europe, via the various channels that the EU has at its disposal, is indeed adopting a structured policy with regard to serious violations of womenâs rights.
In any event, the beginnings of a policy are in place.
The Cotonou Agreement with the ACP countries makes specific mention of genital mutilation.
In addition, the express reference in the Budget that failure to take measures to prevent serious violence against women â and it specifies stoning, public castigation, burning, and rape â justifies the suspension of EU aid.
This EU policy, though, shows too little in the way of structure.
This is why Parliament is asking for some sort of system to be adopted.
What could constitute such a system?
A number of sanctioning elements, for example, the inclusion in trade and cooperation agreements of a specific clause in which it is made explicit that the serious and repeated violation of womenâs rights may ultimately entail suspension of cooperation, is one such sanctioning element.
Secondly, these sanctions and suspensions must be imposed when governments systematically fail to take measures in the legislative, administrative and judicial fields.
There could, of course, also be positive aspects, though.
There is, for example, the systematic inclusion in development aid programmes of projects aimed at fighting violence against women or pressing for, and taking account of, the fact that partner countries ratify the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), as well as the additional protocol.
One example of this might be the talks, or negotiations, that are going on with Iran.
We are very much looking forward to the document that will eventually be on the table.
This document must, in our view, make express reference to actions to counter violence against women, to womenâs rights and also to the CEDAW.
Another possibility is for the Commission to provide staff trained to examine agreements with third countries from the gender perspective, in which local womenâs organisations in the developing countries must also be involved.
The EU Member States, and Europe too, could demand legislation against genital mutilation.
In addition, when refugee status is granted, consideration should be given to the fact that some women flee the violence in their countries.
The European Union has taken as one of its watchwords the protection of human rights, which includes the rights of women.
More than any other region, the EU is expected to act, in some sense, as the worldâs conscience in this respect.
I should like to ask the Commission to what extent it is prepared to adopt a far more structured approach to policy in connection with this problem.
I have received a positive response to a number of questions I have raised, but they are all ad hoc actions.
There is, in fact, little structure in current policy.
Â Â  . I would like to start by commending Ms Smet, a former colleague, indeed one of two former colleagues taking part in this debate.
We were a very distinguished vintage.
I would like to thank Ms Smet for her work as rapporteur on this report.
Her political commitment to the cause of women's rights is well known in both the Commission and the Council.
This own-initiative report raises a wide range of issues.
It is an extremely valuable contribution in placing women nearer the centre of the European Union's foreign policy.
The violation of women's rights in international affairs is an extremely serious issue.
It is an issue to which the Commission and the European Union both attach considerable importance.
This year alone, we have launched three major gender initiatives, under what we call the Programme of Action for the Mainstreaming of Gender Equality and Community Development Cooperation.
First of all, we have set about the drafting of a concise manual setting out essential principles and guidelines for gender mainstreaming in development practice, and it is targeted at Commission officials.
Secondly, we have issued a call for tender for the setting-up of a very large training programme for staff, both in our headquarters in Brussels and in delegations, including also the staff of beneficiary countries.
Thirdly, we have launched a call for proposals to support non-governmental organisation projects.
The Commission has also been very active in contributing to EU efforts to promote the human rights of women in international fora, such as the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, and the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE.
For example, we co-sponsored the resolution on the elimination of violence against women at the last Commission on Human Rights.
It was tabled, as the House will know, by Canada, and we issued a strong statement on the human rights of women which highlighted, among other things, the growing problem of trafficking in human beings and the advantages of gender mainstreaming.
However, what I would like to underline today is that it is our belief that womenâs rights are an integral part of human rights as a whole.
And for this reason, I would like to express the reservations of the Commission over certain recommendations within the report.
The item of principle concern to us is the call for the 'Council and Commission to include in future trade and development agreements, irrespective of and in addition to the essential elements clause, a specific clause providing for the imposition of sanctions and ultimately the suspension of the agreement in cases of serious and repeated violations of womenâs rights'.
As I am sure most Members will agree, when considering issues such as equality, non-discrimination and violence, womenâs rights are best addressed in the overall framework of human rights
Indeed, as quoted in the honourable Member's report, the declaration from the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights clearly underlines that 'the human rights of women and the girl-child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights.'
Moreover, it is important to realise that violence against women on a state level is an integral part of the human rights provisions dealing with torture and the death penalty, which are our priorities in terms of human rights.
It is also worth noting that a separate clause on womenâs rights would also imply the need to include various other human rights issues as individual clauses in subsequent trade and co-operation agreements; that is to say for example, a clause for the rights of the child, or a clause for the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.
The human rights clause is a dynamic instrument through which we can advance human rights in a positive manner.
The measure of its success is not found in the frequency with which it results in punitive measures or suspension of agreements but rather in the structured exchanges on human rights which result in a more realistic way of realising the goals of the human rights clause.
By separating womenâs rights from the overall human rights agenda, Parliament would not necessarily, whatever its admirable intentions, be serving the cause of human rights.
Indeed, such a separation would possibly result in a lessening in its leverage on the political agenda.
Let me give an example, a case in point.
I would like to refer to the current negotiations with Iran on a trade and co-operation agreement.
Central to the human rights dialogue with Iran â and I think I can say that I played a prominent part in getting it started â is the issue of discrimination against women and Iranâs non-ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.
It would seem that in certain cultural environments, it is advantageous for womenâs rights to enter the agenda under the mantle of human rights.
I do not make these points simply theoretically, simply as a result of intellectual or academic study.
I was discussing these issues most recently in Syria with a women's rights lawyer, as part of our discussions there to try to get an association agreement with Syria.
I have discussed these issues in Iran with, for example, female members of the Iranian parliament.
So they are issues about which I can assure the House, even if I disagree with what is proposed, they are issues about which I feel pretty strongly.
Another important human rights instrument with regard to womenâs rights is the European Initiative for Human Rights and Democratisation.
The instrument is very active in involving local womenâs organisations in third countries.
And although gender equality is a horizontal issue under this European initiative, many specific gender projects have also been supported.
For example, we are currently funding a project in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon West Bank and Gaza for legal aid and literacy, for counselling for women victims of violence and for awareness campaigns and research.
I hope the House will take account of our arguments that it is not necessary to have a separate clause in trade and cooperation agreements, since this is an area and an issue fully addressed by our human rights agenda.
I also hope that the House will not conclude from what I have said that we do not give as much priority to the issues very properly raised, for example, gender mutilation which I have not mentioned in this debate.
I hope that the House will not think that we do not give the greatest possible priority to these issues.
In my experience, as a long retired development minister, one of the crucial issues, perhaps crucial issue, in sustainable development policy is gender mainstreaming and decent treatment of women.
I first learnt that lesson 20 odd years ago in Pakistan, and I have continued learning it ever since.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, culture and tradition serve as pretexts for the ongoing suffering of women as victims of violence in many parts of the world.
Female genital mutilation is still practised today, as are stoning and sexual exploitation.
All this is unacceptable for two reasons: these practices constitute violations of fundamental human rights and are out-and-out attacks on democracy.
The European Union, therefore, must use every means at its disposal to fight these iniquities.
The Unionâs foreign policy is one such means, as MrsÂ Smet makes clear in her excellent and also very brave report, on which I would like to congratulate her.
The European Union has indeed written a clause on respect for human rights and democracy into every agreement concluded with third countries.
It has still not been effective enough, however, in combating violence against women.
There is thus a need for stronger resolve and greater clarity in defining the commitments to be honoured by third countries in the field of womenâs rights.
A carrot-and-stick approach to commercial and development agreements must be adopted in future.
By way of a carrot, countries pursuing policies that yield effective results in combating violence against women must be rewarded via the establishment of incentives and more favourable commercial agreements.
As for the stick: by way of sanctions, those countries which tolerate grave violations of womenâs rights must submit to the suspension of the agreements which benefit them.
In the latter scenario, however, the possible negative effects on the people of such sanctions must be carefully assessed.
Lastly, it must be ensured that development aid programmes include projects specially geared towards womenâs rights and combating violence.
Such projects must include active participation by local women.
Indeed, the change in attitudes towards these practices must be brought about through an alliance with women who have been or are being subjected to this kind of violence, and who want to fight it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would firstly like to praise Mrs Smetâs report, which I believe takes account of many of the complaints and demands from womenâs organisations and human rights organisations.
It is true that we have made plenty of progress in terms of statements and words.
It is easy to hear political leaders saying that womenâs rights are human rights and that, as such, they must be protected and defended.
The only problem is that, following these statements, when action should come, nothing happens.
The human rights of women are always relative.
Relative to traditions, to cultures, to families; we always find that a degree of relativity is involved when we have to apply specific protection to women who suffer very serious persecution, which we all know about, which has been described and information on which is available to anybody and is horrifying.
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has already approved guidelines aimed at persuading governments to make decisions on asylum requests in a way which guarantees adequate attention for women within the procedures for determining refugee status, and that applications for reasons of gender should be recognised as such.
What we are ultimately talking about is genuinely protecting, , the human rights of women at international level, and we have the instruments.
For some reason, it is much easier to obtain refugee status when a person is persecuted for political reasons than when a person is persecuted a result of their sex.
Women at risk of genital mutilation do not know that they may have international protection, because we do not tell them, because we never take the step forward necessary to really use the legal protection instruments available to us to protect women.
Mrs Smetâs report points out several ideas which I believe would be very useful in terms of working with third countries with regard to the protection of womenâs rights, but it is the case that we lack one of the instruments, which is, precisely, the possibility for women to seek protection within our borders, within the framework of our legal protection, something which is, however, available in other situations which are clearly comparable with those suffered by women.
The percentage of persecuted women who are granted refugee status is truly ridiculous.
These are the cases which should really be studied if we are to realise that our statements must become specific actions, because â and I would insist â in letters, in statements, in Constitutions, even in many documents from this Parliament and from the Commission, we have recognised that it is essential to protect the women suffering this persecution.
When I talk about persecution, moreover, I am talking about serious aggression, not just any old thing.
I am talking about stoning, about genital mutilation, about burning, about mutilation with acid, about crimes of honour, about enforced marriages, about slavery and about sexual exploitation.
If all of these are not reasons to protect women under international law, then what are?
Why do we not take a step forward and accompany our statements with specific actions?
Why do we not say to women that they should not worry, that they have a place to turn to when they are suffering serious aggression?
The reason is that we are prepared to recognise these aggressions as serious violations of human rights, but we are not prepared to offer them the solutions that we offer in other similar situations.
We are not prepared to do so, furthermore, for the simple reason that they are â that we are â women without power.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank MrsÂ Smet for her very dogged and persistent work on womenâs rights.
It has in actual fact been admirable.
I should also like to thank Commissioner Patten for his speech, even if I have to say that I felt myself to be far more in agreement with a long list of other speeches than I actually did with this one.
Here in Parliament, we very often discuss EU defence, foreign and security policy, and the Commissioner takes the lead in these areas.
We would also say in this connection that the EU should not only be an economic power in the world, that is to say a âsoftâ power, but also a âhardâ power, in other words also have a military preparedness and become, if not a superpower, then in any case a military power.
I do not disagree that we should have a common foreign, security and defence policy, but anyone and everyone, and especially the Commissioner, knows that it will take some time before this happens.
It is not tomorrow that we shall obtain the military capacity and agreement on EU foreign and security matters for which we might all wish.
We are, however, already an economic power.
We are a powerful factor in the economic area, and that is a factor I think we should exploit much more intensively than we do.
We might well, of course, help the oppressed half of the population, that is to say women, that genuinely suffers from a long list of injustices on a variety of fronts: partly cultural traditions, decided by men; partly violence when men do not get their way; and partly trade, because men want to make profits from women; and so on and so forth.
We might well intervene and do something more in these areas.
MrsÂ Smet has herself mentioned the Taliban regime, which did not only take the most basic rights, such as educational rights, away from women, but also every possible other right.
This is an area in which the EU can do something, but are we doing enough?
The Commissioner says we are doing a lot, but are we doing a sufficient amount, and are we doing it systematically enough?
I think that one of the things we could perhaps do in response to this report might be to debate further whether we might not be able to do things more systematically, whether it might not be possible for us to obtain some reports from the Commission on what is actually happening in connection with certain cooperation agreements, and whether anything at all practical ever happens at all when violations of basic human rights, and not merely of womenâs rights, occur.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to thank MrsÂ Smet for a very solid piece of work.
What is nice about our committee â the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities â is that we can often agree from right to left.
I agree with a lot of what previous speakers have said.
I nonetheless wish to point out to Mrs DybkjÃŠr that the view that the European Union should become a very strong military power is not shared by everyone present in this Assembly.
That is not, however, something that we should debate here and now.
It was interesting to hear you, Commissioner Patten, say that, as long as 20 years ago, you appreciated the need to promote womenâs rights as universal human rights.
The problem is that not everyone in your position â or in lower positions, for that matter â has arrived at that insight.
That is partly why we are standing here today with a report such as this to discuss.
MrsÂ Smet also addresses the internal criticism in our Member States, which makes its presence felt indirectly.
Mrs Valenciano MartÃ­nez-Orozco talked a lot about the asylum procedure.
I could also talk for hours about the way in which, above all, the deportation of asylum seekers â when they have had their requests rejected and are to be kicked out of our Member States â contravenes everything that goes under the name of the dignified treatment of human beings.
I should like to hear more about the subject addressed by MrsÂ Smet in paragraph 17 concerning womenâs participation in the agreement process.
We have recently had experience of this in our committee, both where Afghan and Iraqi women are concerned.
Almost nothing at all has been done about their participation, in spite of the fact that we have all said it is an important matter.
I should also very much like to hear Commissioner Pattenâs comments on paragraph 19, to the effect that the Commission should address these issues in all the relevant forums, such as G8 meetings and WTO rounds.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mrs Smet on this courageous own-initiative report.
Not everyone in the various states is giving your report a joyful welcome.
It may escape many of us that, in the context of international relations, and particularly where development cooperation is concerned, it was not so long ago that discussion of human rights was absolutely taboo.
In the past, we were apparently always so kind to each other that, during negotiations, people did not even say what they really thought of situations in certain countries.
What we now have before us is therefore very much a radical departure from this.
I hope that in future, we will have a womenâs rights paragraph when negotiations are started in certain countries.
We often hear that human rights are womenâs rights.
It should be self-evident that womenâs rights are a vital component in development cooperation.
In every culture across the world, women play a specific and decisive role in social, economic and cultural development and in social progress.
In my experience, it is in the fight against human trafficking, and particularly the fight on behalf of the victims, that this need for a strong womenâs policy becomes evident.
Why is this report important, and why should it not become a document that pays mere lip service?
I would immediately remind you of the situation of women in various future Member States where women are still being traded like pieces of furniture.
Looking a little further, we see the Balkans, where, in certain parts of Albania, the Kanoun, the peopleâs legislation, continues to be in use to this day.
That text, the Kanoun, the code of laws of Lek Dukagjin, states that a woman is nothing more than a sack that is made to last for a certain amount of time, comparable to a product with a sell-by-date.
And that in the context of womenâs rights in 2003!
Another example is the person in charge in Ghana, who told me that women yield more than tomatoes.
Why should we not trade in them in that case?
It may be a good idea simply to send this report to a host of embassies, consulates, and people active in international affairs, so that people become aware of what it contains and will consider the fact that a womenâs rights paragraph is a human rights paragraph, and is of vital importance.
Â Â  â I too would like to congratulate Mrs Smet, even if it is because she has managed to draft a report about genital mutilation in women, about public corporal punishment, about stoning, crimes for reasons of honour and forced marriages, without using the terms âIslamâ or âMuslimâ once.
You will have to forgive me for being sarcastic, but I can only deplore the fact that it is apparently deemed politically incorrect to call a spade a spade and to penetrate through to the heart of the matter, even when we are dealing with a very complex problem, namely that of the fundamental failure to respect womenâs rights in a large part of the world.
The report is remarkable in places for its euphemistic use of language, which, again, I can only regret.
For example, it mentions a cultural heritage as a result of which men occupy a privileged position, or traditional views and stereotypes are imposed on women, but nowhere in the document is it named.
We have to ask ourselves who, in fact, stands to gain from such misplaced diffidence.
The cultural relativism that is so prevalent in Europe these days stands in the way of a correct prognosis of the problems and, as such, constitutes more of a barrier to any fundamental solution.
Not every Muslim fails to respect womenâs rights, just as not every Muslim is a fundamentalist.
Reality, though, indicates that the oppression of women has, unfortunately, become the norm in Islamic states and in countries where Muslims make up the majority of the population.
The seriousness of the situation may differ from country to country or from region to region, but discrimination against women is mainstream in the Islamic world and is, as such, not related in any way to the existence of fundamentalist, so-called minorities.
I realise that this is not a comforting thought, but, on the contrary, a reason to implement the measures mentioned in the report with even more determination.
Having said this, I can largely identify with Mrs Smetâs report.
As she rightly stated, when treaties are concluded with third countries, it is not sufficient to provide for clauses with regard to sanctions.
These sanctions must also actually be imposed when violations of womenâs rights are established and if the local government condones, tolerates or even imposes them.
The report very rightly points out that the European Member States must ensure that all forms of violence against women must be recognised and punished within their own legal systems.
Genital mutilations take place even on our own soil, and in that connection, there is a related form of the problem that deserves our attention, namely surgery to restore the hymen.
Demand for such operations is growing rapidly and I can predict that discussions will follow about the question whether social security should soon start to fund the preservation of such backward customs.
It is regrettable that the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Equal Opportunities has apparently decided to give the issue of headscarves, the very symbol of womenâs oppression in Islam, a wide berth.
You only need to jump on the metro in Brussels, Paris, or take the underground in London, to realise how popular the headscarf is compared to some ten years ago.
The radicalisation of Islam is not simply something that is taking place in Pakistan or in Egypt, but also in our own large cities.
Europe should therefore send out a forceful message that our standards and values, such as the giving of equal rights to men and women, are not up for discussion, and neither should they be.
Those who are unwilling to accept this are no longer welcome here.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, year after year hundreds of thousands of women are the victims of extreme violence: sexual exploitation, rape, public castigation, burning and stoning.
The time came for an initiative to deal with these grave violations.
MrsÂ Smet has put forward a very good report, which also encompasses types of suffering; psychological, physical and sexual suffering.
I support her demand that in future there must be clauses to stop EU aid when womenâs right are continually and systematically violated.
They should be integrated into trade and development agreements with third countries, or bilaterally or multilaterally within the framework of the WTO.
If positive steps are not taken to prevent violence against women then that must result in sanctions and these agreements being frozen.
International indifference on this issue is embarrassing.
This applies to countries such as Afghanistan, where for years the Taliban demoted women to second-class citizens, as well as Iran, where there are serious offences against women.
Non-Muslim states are among them too, though, MrÂ Claeys.
To obtain more information about this the Commission should establish contacts with institutions and non-governmental organisations at national, regional and local level.
International conferences and talks and â CommissionerÂ Patten â a yearly statement by the Commission on the regression and the progress are further important steps.
We must make politicians and the public in the countries affected more aware and more vigilant.
These types of violence must also be prosecuted with greater determination in the EU.
We have had solutions for years but they have not been implemented.
My fellow-Members who spoke before me have also mentioned this.
In our Member States case law must be changed on this issue, genital mutilation must be banned and trafficking of women must be fought more determinedly with the cooperation of Europol and Eurojust.
The priority, however, is that women are able to use all resources so that they can enjoy their fundamental rights without any discrimination.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for once again giving us the opportunity to talk about women.
At a time when a woman who fights for human rights, and womenâs rights in particular, has just been awarded the Nobel peace prize, at a time when serious discussions are taking place regarding a more coherent global development and finding solutions to conflicts, let us again take this opportunity, albeit very late in the day, to highlight the very specific situation of women.
Every year thousands, even millions of females suffer violence in every possible form.
How many silent voices are there behind the statistics, how many aspects are disguised or hidden behind the non-interference clause or the cultural heritage argument?
In the European Union we say that human rights should come before any custom or social philosophy.
However, when we are talking about international relations, which is the subject of this report, there is often a clash between two world views.
Should we be content with acknowledging but not hearing what these women are asking for, either in their own countries or in seeking protection through the international law that we support?
So how much scope do we have to state that we condemn these practices and that we are not being fooled?
The instruments mentioned in the report are proof of the outstanding pragmatism of women in general, and in particular of Mrs Smet, who I would like to congratulate on her work.
We must reaffirm that any violence against women is in itself sufficient grounds, for granting the right to asylum and refugee status.
In response to this discriminatory violence, we need to use the violence of economic sanctions, unless we have an order of priorities in which women have a much lower value than cooperation agreements or firm traditions with a very sad history.
Let us stop talking and writing about this and try to be as pragmatic as women in general can be.
Â Â  Mr President, this text expresses many good intentions against violence towards women.
Yes, it is revolting that in the twenty-first century, women can be stoned, mutilated, sacrificed by fire, or victims of forced marriages, sexual slavery, trafficking in human beings or so-called honour crimes.
However good intentions are all the report contains, and the annexes on the cases of half a dozen countries where these types of practices take place speak for themselves.
Despite the fact that respect for womenâs rights has been included in various political and trade agreements, not only has nothing happened in the countries concerned, but the European Union has not suspended the agreements binding it to those countries.
Trade rights prevail over womenâs rights.
In reality, these barbaric practices are being continued with the collusion, at least from a passive point of view, of supposedly civilised countries.
Moreover, if the European Union wants to claim to be a champion of womenâs rights and be credible, it first needs to show that it is capable of making all of its Member States recognise the fundamental right of women to control their own bodies, including the right to abortion.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the opportunity this evening to debate the violation of women's rights in EU international relations.
Historically, the very concept of international relations has really excluded women.
As Professor Cynthia Enlow, one of the eminent authors in gender and international relations, describes, the value of women's experiences in war, marriage, trade, prostitution, factory work or domestic chores has been ignored by world leaders and on the international level.
This in turn has led to classical international relations being one of the most gender-blind forms of political analysis.
Women worldwide still earn less than men even here in the European Union where the gender pay gap still cuts across all sectors, have less access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities and are often denied full political and economic rights.
Violence against women often stems from this very discrimination, though women are not seen as equal to men.
In turn, gender-based violence is legitimised and women's human rights are denied.
Women should be entitled to the right to life; the right not to be subjected to torture; the right to equal protection in times of international or internal armed conflict; the right to liberty and security of the person; the right to equal protection under the law; the right to equality in the family; the right to the highest standard of physical and mental health and the right to just and favourable conditions of work.
Even in European Union countries we still see that violence against women is treated unfairly.
If I take Italy â which at the moment holds the presidency of the European Union â as an example, in February 1999 the Italian Supreme Court overturned on appeal, a court verdict which had found a male driving instructor guilty of raping his 18-year-old student.
The Supreme Court noted that the victim was wearing jeans at the time of the offence and stated that jeans cannot even be partly removed without the active cooperation of the person wearing them.
The court decided that the victim had consented to sex and concluded that the rape was not proven.
With these kinds of attitudes, the emphasis on women's rights being integral to human rights is vital.
As my Spanish colleague said, at the moment they are merely seen as an aside, rather than being integral to human rights.
Gender considerations have to be taken into account through gender mainstreaming.
We should welcome the Commission's initiatives.
However, there is always more that can be done.
The initiative to include a clause in the 2003 budget which states that the lack of action to prevent and combat severe violence against women, such as stoning, public castigation, genital mutilation, burning and rape will constitute a reason to suspend EU assistance must be taken into consideration.
In Kenya, in one particular community, the incidence of genital mutilation was as high as 97%.
Wife inheritance continues, and experiences of rape and domestic abuse are rife.
In Pakistan, the Human Rights Commission estimated that in the year 2000 a woman was raped every two hours and hundreds of women were victims of honour killings, domestic violence, burnings and murder.
As you start to explore the nature of violence against women, and the European Union's role in international relations, there are pressures we can place to help to prevent these atrocities from happening.
We have an opportunity to make international relations wake up to their responsibility and recognise women.
We have responsibilities in the European Union to uphold women's rights across the globe.
Â Â  Mr President, I suppose it is true to say that a lot of what needs to be said has already been said in this debate but I think it is important that as many people as possible should participate in this debate.
I think, in particular, men should participate in this debate because this is an issue which concerns not only the women in our society but the whole of society.
We are all diminished by the fact that so many millions of our citizens of the world are still denied basic human rights.
I am particularly supportive of paragraph 13 of MrsÂ Smet's report which urges that refugee status be given to those women who are threatened with the kind of violence that has already been outlined here.
It is a sad fact that in my own country â and I believe in other European countries â the threat of genital mutilation or stoning or honour murders are not a basis for granting refugee status.
That has to change if we are serious about making it clear that we stand for the human rights of all.
The European Union's development aid programmes should include programmes which seek to ensure that women can participate fully in society.
I have to say I disagree with Commissioner Patten in relation to the trade agreements.
We are quite fortunate that we have a person of the calibre of Commissioner Mr Patten doing this task, and it is clear that he has a commitment to women's rights and human rights generally.
But I am afraid the evidence is that the approach so far has not made significant progress in ending the practices which are so prevalent in developing countries.
I think that we have to begin to toughen up on the need to apply sanctions or suspend agreements if we are going to make progress in this area.
Those we are making agreements with have to appreciate that we are serious.
I am not talking about suspending agreements at the drop of a hat.
But where there are persistent violations of human rights in relation to women's rights and children's rights, we have to demonstrate that we are serious about our commitments.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0286/2003) by Mr Pitella, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the Structural Funds: trend in outstanding commitments and requirements for 2004 (2002/2272(INI)).
Â Â  .â Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, this is a report that takes a snapshot of a problem, identifies a risk and outlines some solutions.
The problem is the outstanding commitments, this gap that is still too wide between commitments and payments, as regards both the Structural Funds and other fields, too.
Outstanding commitments are a composite phenomenon: some are physiological whereas others are pathological, and it is on the latter that action needs to be taken.
The risk is not just the loss of Structural Funds by the regions to which they are assigned; a greater risk is the loss of credibility for cohesion policy within the European Union.
We firmly believe that the Union, and the enlarged Union to an even greater extent, needs an effective, consolidated, modern cohesion policy.
The solutions we have outlined, on which we seem to have a good understanding with Mr Barnier, who has always been open to dialogue and debate, can be split into two groups: short-term and medium-term solutions.
The former include, in particular, the solution of adjusting the level of the payments entered in the budget.
Of course, this provision of resources must go hand in hand with a more effective working partnership between the Commission and governments, between governments and regions, and between regions and subregional and local entities.
Moreover, the work of monitoring the new Member States, something that is already being done by the Commission, urgently needs to be stepped up.
As regards medium-term solutions, the Commission should promptly present its guidelines on the regulation governing the next programming period so that future objectives and implementing arrangements can be laid down in a clear and readily comprehensible form.
To this end, we believe the following approach will be necessary: firstly, stressing the Commissionâs key role, which ought to be focused on defining development priorities, on the consistency of operations with those priorities and on monitoring the effectiveness of implementing systems, while responsibility for implementing and managing operations should be devolved to the Member States; secondly, being straightforward, clear and precise, and, in connection with this simplification objective, it would therefore appear vital to combine the funds and entrust management of the single fund to a single Commission department; thirdly, provide for programming arrangements to be decided upon in the context of a partnership between the Commission and the Member State concerned; fourthly, give the monitoring committee a greater role, so that decisions on the programme and programme changes can be taken over by the monitoring committee; and, lastly, maintain the incentive measures for effective implementation of operations, such as the n+2 automatic decommitment rule and the reserve for rewarding positive performance.
I should like to finish by addressing the automatic decommitment issue.
31 December is nearly here and there is a new deadline.
We believe the rule should still be retained for the next few years, since there is no doubt that it has had a major deterrent effect.
It is true, however, as Commissioner Barnier has pointed out, that in many situations regions and national governments have adopted a number of devices in order to certify 100% expenditure and avoid losing the funds.
We call on Commissioner Barnier to exercise the strictest surveillance on this issue and we invite him in the meantime to prevent resources released through so-called âside projectsâ from being spent on anything other than the regional and national programmes.
I shall conclude with an example: if the Italian Government â to speak of my home country â receives transport funds to carry out transport infrastructure work in southern Italy and then, after releasing resources through side projects, passes that saving on to infrastructure work in the north, we should intervene to prevent that from happening.
I hope Parliament will grant this report a very broad consensus, since that would give the approaches it contains great political credibility.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to express my gratitude to Mr Giovanni Pittella for the extremely careful and detailed work â true to his temperament â that he has personally led, independently, rigorously, and uncompromisingly.
I would also like to thank you, Mr Pittella, for the quality of the dialogue that you have established â again uncompromisingly, with each person in their role â not only with the Commissioner responsible for regional policy but also with my colleagues.
The report that you have just presented is the fruit of that dialogue, which took place both in the context of the Committee on Budgets and of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, both of which I am always happy to attend, as you kindly said.
I was very pleased to hear you presenting your report from a dual perspective, both historical â I will say a few words about settling the past â and looking forward.
You also stressed, almost more so, through your proposals and ideas regarding future regional policy, the need to learn both from the most distant past and also the most recent past.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to point out that at the end of 2003 we are at a crossroads where we need to firstly settle the previous period, 1994-1999, using certain methods and regulations, secondly manage the current 2000-2006 period in the best way possible, using other methods and regulations, and thirdly prepare for the future period based on the proposals that the Commission makes at the end of this year in the third report on cohesion, using other methods and regulations.
This is why, Mr Pittella, what you are suggesting and recommending will, I promise you, be very useful for this report on cohesion and for preparing for the new period.
In the text that you presented, you stress two important issues.
The first question is: why is there an under-execution of payments under the Structural Funds this year and what will be the payment appropriations requirements for 2004?
You mentioned the second question earlier: what are the foreseeable effects of the n+2 rule and what measures should be implemented to simplify it in the future cohesion policy after 2006?
To add to the speeches that I already made last month on the 2004 budget and in May, before the Committee on Budgets, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give some answers to these two major issues, based on three points:
The first point: where are we today?
Budget execution worked correctly in 2003 despite some unforeseen events.
With regard to the current planning period, our efforts at simplification are beginning to bear fruit.
It has been possible to make the payments more quickly than before: EURÂ 12Â billion at the end of August, compared with only 9.6 billion in August 2002, which represents real progress from one year to the next.
However â once again I will be frank, because I am in the habit of saying what I think and see â for the 1994-1999 period, in other words the first period, the closure operations are progressing slowly, too slowly, and we are faced with an excess of appropriations.
The Member States sent their files at the very last minute, in January, February and often even in March, with the last deadline being on 31Â March, and I am sorry to say that it is taking longer than foreseen to examine all of these files, of which there are several thousand.
This issue of the closure of programmes for the 1994-1999 period is therefore essential for what we call the âoutstanding commitmentsâ or RAL.
The second point: faced with this situation, what can we do and what should we do?
My aim, MrÂ Pittella, ladies and gentlemen, is still to reduce these âoutstanding commitmentsâ as much as possible by the end of 2003, and we are going to continue to reduce them from both ends.
Today I also sent you, Mr Pittella, and the Committee on Budgets, some information demonstrating the size of this reduction, on the one hand by cancelling commitments that should not give rise to a payment â release of appropriations is already being prepared â and, on the other hand, by actually and genuinely executing payments.
Will this be enough to deal with all the appropriations available in the 2003 budget?
I do not think so.
This is why the Commission is soon going to put forward an amending budget in order to cancel part of these appropriations.
With regard to the 2004 payment appropriations, I am not going to go back over in detail what I said to you last month, but simply point out that our approach is prudent given the experience of previous years.
Nevertheless, if the payment appropriations were insufficient due to a faster execution than foreseen for the 2000-2006 period and a legacy from the 1994-1999 period, the Commission would naturally suffer the consequences.
I noted in passing your particular concern regarding good execution of appropriations in the new Member States for 2004-2006, a concern that I entirely share.
I would also like to note that this depends on good planning, which will only be successful if the budgetary authority provides us with the human resources that we have requested.
Mr Pittella, like you, I am very concerned that this good planning should succeed and that appropriations should be well utilised in the new Member States in 2004-2006, which is a very small period: two and a half years.
A few days ago I met with the Ministers of Finance of these ten countries plus Bulgaria and Romania.
I met with them again yesterday in Rome along with the Ministers from the current countries.
I am even going to add something very important to prove that I am in full agreement with you.
I think that the accession of these countries, and therefore the success of enlargement, is currently based on rules, laws and regulations that are still a little restrictive.
However, in most peopleâs minds, the success of the accession in the first few years is based on the success of the cohesion policy, on the fact that we will be capable, with the authorities of those countries, of using the money available, which is significant because we are talking about EURÂ 22 billion for cohesion.
Third point: what can we do together, collectively?
In the immediate future, we need to maintain and even improve the circulation of information between us.
MrÂ Pittella, I am absolutely in favour of the that you propose, although there are some arrangements that we need to discuss.
My intention is also to continue to be transparent.
This is why you will be regularly informed, with updates several times per year, of the progress of three parameters: forecasts regarding the application of the n+2 rule, which I hope to maintain for the next period, forecasts for execution by the Member States, and finally, the progress of closure of the 1994-1999 programmes.
I would like to conclude by stressing how appealing this cooperation is for me and for the Commission as a whole.
As we are preparing to adopt, as I said earlier, and submit to you the third report on economic, social and territorial cohesion, it is clear, as you have constantly pointed out yourselves, that good execution of the Structural Funds and Community initiatives is one of the conditions required for this ambitious policy that we wish to preserve and revive to be credible.
Here I will use your formula, Mr Pittella, of pathological RALs, which are different from physiological RALs.
Like you, I am very concerned with this credibility, which relies largely on our capacity to utilise the money available, to show that we need it and to prove that it has been used effectively.
To go a little further in my answer, over and above the comments that you made, which I will probably largely repeat in the draft regulations, the idea that we have of the future cohesion policy is that it should be more focused on the objective of convergence and competitiveness for ObjectiveÂ 1 and the Cohesion Funds and entirely focused on the ambitions of Lisbon and Gotenborg for Objectives 2 and 3, in other words more generally qualitative and decentralised for the other regions that are not the most behind in development.
I will repeat your idea, which I agree with, Mr Pittella, that during the next period, the Commission should be able to concentrate on its strategic objective and also that the Member States and regional authorities should be given more responsibility for management.
This requires a better sharing of financial responsibility, but you also made comments and suggestions on this point, which we are going to look at during the very last weeks of preparation of the third report on cohesion.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Pittella, for the fundamentally important work he has done with regard to this pressing issue.
I was glad to see that the report takes a very similar line to that of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with regard to the problem of outstanding commitments in respect of the Structural Funds.
Many of the issues contained in our committeeâs opinion have also been included in the report.
The rapporteur has taken creditable account of factors that impact on the system, dealt with problematic issues critically, and proposes solutions with regard to the delays.
In my opinion, the most important of these are the simplification and clarification of the system.
Structural Funds payments have piled up to an alarming extent.
The main procedure for controlling this trend in the current term is the n+2 rule.
The rapporteur has found a sufficiently rigid and balanced approach to its application.
The application of the n+2 rule is now facing its first real test, as payments requested by the end of the year are to be brought to the Commissionâs attention and the overall amount will be seen.
The Commissionâs monitoring system and the way it reports to Parliament must be improved.
One problem is the inadequate nature of Member State payment claim forecasts.
In a system that is decentralised in the way it operates, Member States have an important responsibility for seeing to it that the system works as a whole.
In regional policy it is time we switched from the debate on payments to one on the quality and effectiveness of measures.
We will have the necessary ingredients for this when we have data based on the mid-term reviews.
Above all, there must be a debate on quality and results by the Monitoring Committees at regional level.
More reports and less bureaucracy serve as a guiding principle for better regional policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I originally wanted to say something about the nonsensical procedure that we are going through at this witching hour, but then I saw all the young people who have been listening attentively and with great concentration, and whom, in the meantime, we seem to have lost again.
I hope somebody explained to them why it is ...
âŠ that there are so very few Members in the Chamber.
That brings me back to the question of whether it makes sense to be here at this late hour.
We few Members of this House here present know what we think.
We have exchanged views in lengthy discussions in very in-depth preparatory meetings.
It dishonours the rapporteur, who has invested so much zeal in this work, to have his words declaimed shortly before midnight to an almost empty Chamber.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats endorses his report.
I am grateful to Mr Pittella for his good cooperation.
As the problems have been aired, let me draw your attention to just a few points.
It is not acceptable for national ministers to rejoice when funds in Brussels are not drawn on.
They may well be glad when a few million euros are returned to them and can be used for this or that other purpose, but if that happens, then the Structural Funds, which were set up to benefit the most needy regions in the EU, are failing in their purpose.
When we analyse the way funds are administered, we cannot but note with a critical eye the re-emergence of old familiar problems.
Although national co-financing creates great problems for some Member States, we have good reasons for wanting to hold fast to the principle of it; we should, on the other hand, abandon excessively complicated and extensive, even sometimes unnecessary requirements in the procedure as a whole.
Simplification and clarity, too, can result in stringent and necessary monitoring and even make it easier.
This is something for the Commission and the Member States to do.
The excessively lengthy planning procedures mean that delays are virtually inevitable.
The current state of affairs as regards the outflow of funds is disturbing, but surely no surprise to the actors involved.
It will be no simpler after the European Union gains ten new members.
That is why there is a need for coordination between the actors to be simplified in order to enable EU funds to be targeted and used in a rational way.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, despite CommissionerÂ Barnierâs undoubted competence, it is undeniable that one of the most intriguing features of European politics is the persistence of a significant level of under-execution of the Structural Funds, as measured by the execution rate for payment appropriations.
This becomes stranger still in view of the fact that the first objective of structural policy is the sustainable development of the Union.
It is quite true that the persistence of high and rising levels of outstanding financial commitments does not necessarily mean that none of the final objectives of cohesion policy can ever be reached.
In any case, those objectives must be reached â and fast â so that the lionâs share, at least, of the outstanding commitments does not become lost through the bureaucracy of the institutions or through the political and administrative incompetence of the governments of the Member States.
Moreover, the blame can and should be shared by the two decision-making tiers.
That is a logical consequence of the disparities in the breakdown of executions between the countries of the Union, and between the different Structural Funds.
Rendering regional policy and Structural Fund management more effective, therefore, depends on the right choices being made at national level, but it also stems from regulations and from the elimination of pointless bureaucratic requirements.
The report, moreover, recognises the Commissionâs role in introducing simplifying measures, but also argues that those measures are inadequate and proposes, quite rightly, that they be revised.
Furthermore, cohesion policy is on the agenda and the tabling of the Sapir report means that its reevaluation cannot be avoided.
Without wanting to pre-empt a separate political debate at this stage, it is important to emphasise that the fastest and easiest way to render political policies superfluous is to make them incomprehensible and impracticable in advance by administering the prescribed dose of bureaucracy and red tape.
The Commission, therefore, must urgently enhance and emphasise its strategic function in defining priorities, leaving the responsibility for implementing and managing funds to the Member States.
Hence I welcome MrÂ Pittellaâs report, acknowledge its timeliness and support its proposals.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism deal on a regular basis with the monitoring of how the European regional and structural policy is implemented in political and budgetary terms.
In all the years in which I have been following this process, one problem has always been pre-eminent, namely that of the hesitant and delayed realisation of the various European programmes, expressed in concrete figures in the RALs.
That is what Mr Pittella has elucidated in precise terms in his very fine report.
Commissioner Barnier, you said that you expect the position with regard to 2003 to turn out better.
It is indeed the case that a number of points show improvement, but I ask you to note that, in the year up to 20 September this year, the RALs for Objectives 1 and 2 have increased.
INTERREGâs flow of appropriations is overwhelming; Objective 2âs is inadequate.
Over and over again, the problems are the same.
When it adopted the Berlin agenda for the period 2000-2006, the Commission made a series of changes to the planning, administration and realisation of a whole range of programmes.
Today, I believe, we can already see how inadequate those changes were.
Economic and social cohesion, one of the cornerstones of EU policy, is already, in an EU with fifteen Member States, exposed to severe strain, let alone what will happen in an EU of twenty-five.
If we want to face up to this challenge and retain the solidarity principle, the existing rules will have to undergo fundamental changes.
Taking the first of these, the economies of most of the Member States are in a crisis situation.
The Member Statesâ budgetary discipline, as demanded by the Stability and Growth Pact, is pro-cyclical in its effects.
Governments are restricted as to what they can do to fund national development programmes.
Gaps are becoming apparent in their capacity to cofinance, with a consequent increase in the amounts of European funds left unused.
Can we draw from this the conclusion that the Member States no longer need the money?
No, we cannot.
It follows that greater flexibility must be permitted in the Stability Pact both as it relates to investments and to cofinance.
Secondly, although I have always been, and still am, a defender of the ân+2â rule for the current planning period, I urge that it be handled in a more flexible manner, for example, that it be, in exceptional cases, deferred to ân+3â or, indeed, that funds be released to those countries and regions that can guarantee that they will be applied in due time and order.
Finance ministers should not be able to celebrate annual injections of billions of euros into their national economies just because EU funds have not been used within the deadlines.
Thirdly, just like the rapporteur, I regard it as necessary to simplify the implementing regulations and those on the transfer of responsibility for the monitoring of funds and their use in an appropriate and flexible way.
Fourthly, I should like to say what I expect the Commissionâs mid-term assessment to include, particularly with a view to a detailed analysis with reference to those countries, regions and programmes that contribute to the problem with unspent funds.
With the prospect of Parliamentary elections in 2004, we have to prove to the public that we are capable of using tax revenue properly, efficiently, and in a targeted way.
If we fail to do so, we will have lost some of the justification for our own existence.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the problem of the ever growing reservoir of commitments outstanding in the framework of Structural Funds policy seems to have become a permanent feature now.
The content of the reservoir is no less than EUR 92 billion and therefore approximately equivalent to the whole of the EU budget for a year.
The 'n+2' rule is a first necessary step in order to reduce the level of this reservoir.
However, the ultimate goal is, of course, for this Structural Funds policy to be better aligned to its objectives.
This question is even more pressing in the light of the pending enlargement.
The Commission has tabled a number of proposals which should deal with the problems involved in implementing the policy and make it more effective.
A first requirement seems to be to reduce the complexity and cut back on the endless decision-making procedures.
A clarification of the rules and improving coordination will equally have a positive impact.
We still have not tackled a number of fundamental problems, though.
I would like to mention the fact that an important share of aid still ends up in relatively prosperous regions.
The situation in Italy provides very clear evidence of this.
The south remains poverty-stricken while the north is immensely rich.
And this while Italyâs GDP as a whole is around the EU average.
In 2002, the Central Planning Office in the Netherlands presented a study identifying the possible causes of the ineffectiveness of Structural Funds policy.
In summary, the researchers concluded that the Structural Funds policy cannot be effective until the four conditions have been met.
They are, first of all, sound institutional quality; secondly, low inflation; thirdly, transparent and reliable government policy, and fourthly a low level of corruption.
It is sad to say, but remarkably enough, the four largest recipients of funds from the Structural Funds score very badly in terms of the above criteria.
Consequently, the institutional quality in those countries will need to be improved as a matter of priority.
This also applies to the EUâs future Member States.
If not, we will be fighting a losing battle, and a renewed increase in the level of the reservoir would loom from May 2004 onwards.
European policy that aims to promote economic growth in poor regions and narrow the prosperity gap should be more coherent.
We would therefore suggest that Structural Funds policy should focus on Objective 1, for which only the poorest regions qualify.
Other forms of structural policy, especially those that benefit relatively prosperous regions, very often seem to frustrate labour mobility or lead to distortion of competition.
What also happens regularly is that national or regional authorities submit their least effective projects for application for European aid.
We should put a stop to the recycling, or transfer, of European funds between the rich Member States.
With its proposals, the Commission has made a start on improvement.
