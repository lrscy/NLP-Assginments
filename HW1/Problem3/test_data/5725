We have not yet achieved our aim; we do not yet have this issue fully under control.
I also agree with the rapporteur that if we want a common arms policy - meaning that individual countries do not do their own research or manufacture their own arms but that we do this together at European level - we not only need a common armaments market internally, but also a common arms export policy.
Just as we have a common trade policy for normal goods, so we also need a common policy for arms exports, and I agree with what we say in paragraph 3: the data available is insufficient.
The type of arms that are supplied, the total value of exports, the number of licences refused, more precise information on the country of destination and the end-user - we need all of these data, otherwise we cannot exercise control of the market and spot when something is wrong.
Brokers in the arms trade are quite unique agents.
We are familiar with the various scandals.
As I have already said, there is a lot of money to be made.
That is why I very much welcome our call for a register of arms brokers and also for an authorisation system of some kind.
We urgently need a common position here, and this Parliament calls on the Council to bring about an agreement amongst the Member States.
I also wish to mention that the EU cannot shoulder this burden alone.
We need our neighbours, but we also need Russia and the United States of America.
We would be pleased if the French initiative were successful.
It is in the interests of the credibility of the EU's external policy for us to stick to our principles in this sector too, and I very much welcome Mr von Wogau's report.
Thank you very much, Mr Leinen.
We hope your work in the Council of Europe also goes well.
Mr President, the report under discussion refers to an issue of huge strategic, political and economic importance.
Indeed, the production of and trade in arms secures huge excess profits for multinational big business which, with privatisation, now controls these sectors.
However, quite apart from the profits, by supplying arms, producer countries also safeguard political control of purchasing countries, both through the rake-off paid by the arms industries to the governments of these countries and through control of their equipment.
Thus, all means are being used to promote the creation of conditions of demand and consumption of arms, by fomenting tension, armed clashes and massacres of or infighting among peoples.
The demand and consumption of these products also concerns the producer countries.
In fact, as we know, our governments are constantly strengthening both the repressive mechanisms used against the burgeoning demonstrations by our peoples against the anti-grass roots policy and conflict prevention, crisis management and the fight against terrorism, in other words military intervention the world over.
All this, which is expressed through the constant militarisation of the European Union, in ever closer cooperation with ????, calls for huge quantities of arms.
That is why Mr Solana proposes increasing the military forces.
These developments, of course, are fraught with huge dangers for the peoples of the European Union and for mankind as a whole within the framework of intra-imperialist rivalry.
However, they satisfy the speculative appetites of the political-military-industrial network which, especially after September 11, now has absolute control over US policy and is also strengthening its influence in the countries of the European Union.
The report being debated, however good the rapporteur's intentions may be, does not refer to these questions, or rather it conceals them.
Like all the previous reports, it formulates wishes and proposals which will never be applied.
That is why what is needed is not codes of conduct, compliance with which depends on the good will of the Member States, but the introduction of mandatory rules and controls and the gradual reduction in the production, movement and use of arms, pending their definitive prohibition.
We need to convert war industries into peace industries.
These are the demands of the movement for peace.
We support them, which is why we shall not vote for the report.
Mr President, I should like to say first of all that I share the hope that the Code of Conduct, when applied in the long term, will mean that fewer arms are manufactured, whereas Mr von Wogau gave the impression in his speech that the aim was for less money to be spent on manufacturing arms.
Secondly, I have to say - and I would ask the President to send a note to this effect to the Council - that a discussion is being held here between the European Parliament and the Council, which means that the Council Presidency is actually who we should be talking to because it has 100% responsibility for implementing the Code, and I am disappointed that it is not represented here at all.
Thirdly, given that the Council Presidency is not taking its responsibilities seriously, I actually think that it would be sensible for the Commission to share that responsibility, namely where integrated instruments apply, which would also give the European Parliament a better opportunity of contributing to improving the Code of Conduct.
One of the key issues that we need to address is the Europe-wide registration of arms with the involvement of all Member States, and I think that entrusting the Commission with these tasks would be an important institutional step forward.
The main problem - and this has already been mentioned - is that the Code is not binding and cannot therefore be applied effectively.
This is therefore another central issue that urgently needs to be resolved.
Nevertheless, we also still have the problem - and this too has already been mentioned - that this Code is insufficient to ensure proper surveillance of arms movements.
That is why we urgently need registration, firstly of the product, secondly of its movements and thirdly of the end-user.
It is also necessary to have a register of how the arms are intended to be used when they reach the end-user, and for this purpose we need a joint surveillance office in the European Union.
Even better would be an arbitration service, an ombudsman, to deal with questions and criticism from the public, because arms can still end up in the wrong place and because arms from the European Union still lead to conflicts today.
I think that it has become clear that the main problem with the Arms Code is implementation.
In terms of implementation, we still fall far short of meeting our actual standards, and we also know that arms exports still lead to fresh violence in latent conflicts, to the violation of human rights and to situations of war, where we then have to invest more money and personnel to restore peace to the region.
That is why one of the key tasks of a common foreign and security policy is to ensure that arms exports are tracked and restricted and that those who violate the Code are punished accordingly.
The von Wogau report therefore proposes regulating arms exports and making them more ethical.
One might as well try to make murder, plunder or abduction more ethical.
The simple fact that the great powers are wasting enormous sums of money on weapons of mass destruction shows that the present organisation of society is barbaric.
The governments of the great nations, who are responsible for criminal wars from Iraq to Afghanistan and accomplices of state terrorism in Palestine, would like to deny a number of smaller countries, whose regimes they do not like, access to weapons. They would like to do the same to certain organisations described by them as terrorist, and to the world of organised crime.
Even that, however, is proving impossible.
In an economy where arms dealers are willing to sell the rope to hang themselves if it makes them a profit, how can they be prevented from bypassing government controls?
When the report welcomes the French initiative concerning the submission of a proposal for an International Code on Transparency, moreover, or refers to the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, that is both odious and ludicrous, since those countries are among the world's leading arms exporters and are periodically shaken by politico-financial scandals involving highly placed politicians and arms dealers.
A major arms dealer has recently been appointed to a ministerial post, representing a developing country at UNESCO. This is ample proof of how useless and ridiculous it is to attempt to bring morality into the arms trade.
Legal proceedings have been opened against this individual, but he will now enjoy diplomatic immunity. Naturally, we are opposed to this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, so much is clear.
You spoke about a politically binding code, but this is not enforceable.
We cannot jolt our governments' consciences.
That is a sad thing in connection with arms, because these are not everyday goods.
Nevertheless, they are all too easily used in this way.
As regards the report by Mr von Wogau, I think that he is right in noting, on the fourth opportunity we have had to give our reaction to the Council's annual report, that progress can be noted once more, on paper, in reporting and transparency.
As regards the effectiveness of the agreements, I have the impression that these are chiefly concerned with preventing unfair competition and with not tormenting each other.
Brokering, too, is to be taken rather more seriously.
I must say that I am not so optimistic in practice.
European arms exports are clearly rising instead of falling.
Many believe that military expenditure should be increased; while we, on the contrary, are inclined to think that it should be reduced.
The military-industrial complex is organising in order to lobby Brussels intensively.
Large parts of the world continue to be inundated with arms that are used not only against the people living there, but also against our own peacekeeping forces.
I saw a BBC report in which French peacekeeping forces in Eastern Congo were fired at with arms supplied with the express complicity of Rwanda or Uganda.
When I look at the list of suppliers, I see that there are still European countries that either directly supply arms or let arms be purchased using budgetary support, which amounts to the same thing.
I should also like to point out that, in recent weeks, refugees from Uganda have been arriving in Chad.
NGOs on site have reported to us that the proliferation of small arms in that area was the direct cause of the outbreak of armed conflict.
I read here that inquiries have been made into how arms can be supplied for humanitarian purposes.
I think that it is a bit much to state that this could be possible.
I do not acknowledge that possibility.
In my country, the Arms Act was very strict, and, back then, it was said that no arms were to be supplied to regions of conflict.
Nevertheless, people found an opportunity to export them to Nepal, and now we even have regionalisation of the arms trade.
At European level, the Code of Conduct may have been adopted, but there is a problem of interpretation, and, as our fellow Members have already said, the grey area is extensive.
Exporting arms to regions that are somewhat unstable of course means exporting to the best customers, because willing buyers do not discriminate.
Irrespective of whether the country is rich or poor, arms are being bought and apparently paid for, if necessary with raw materials stolen from the country itself, as is the case in Eastern Congo.
Mr President, I have listened intently to all those who took the floor and have taken careful note of the comments and criticisms. I should like to respond first to a point raised by Mrs Maes.
A common Council action aimed at restricting the proliferation of small arms has been in place now for a number of years. Admittedly, its effects have been somewhat uneven.
In addition, I understand the European Union supports several other specific actions concerning the destruction of stocks of such low calibre weapons or small arms in particular countries.
I shall now turn to comments made by several other speakers and in particular by Mrs Korhola. I would like to recall that the acceding countries already subscribe to the code of good conduct Mr von Wogau and I referred to earlier.
These countries are taking part in the exchange of information within the Council.
Lastly, I would like to clarify that the common position on monitoring arms brokering activities was adopted by the Council last June.
Those are the three points I wished to make as this debate draws to a close, Mr President.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m.
The next item is the Commission statement on the European Union and the campaign against torture.
Commissioner Barnier has the floor.
Mr President, the European Union has clearly demonstrated by the political, diplomatic and financial action it has taken over recent years that it is committed to the campaign against torture in the world.
The Union raises the question regularly in its political dialogue with third countries and is also in the front line in promoting the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which provides for the creation of national and international machinery allowing places where prisoners are held to be inspected.
In order to strengthen the European Union's action in a number of third countries, the Council Working Group on Human Rights is also currently preparing a strategy for a more effective application of the guidelines on torture adopted by the Union in 2001, while analysing information about cases of torture sent in by European Union heads of mission in different parts of the world.
Large amounts of money are given to non-governmental organisations and international bodies for the prevention of torture and the rehabilitation of victims through the European initiative for democracy and human rights.
Last year, for example, EUR 25 million were allocated to projects of this kind under a call for proposals for 2002 and 2003.
In 1994, your Parliament played an important role in the allocation of funds for victims of acts of torture from the European Union budget.
I am very much aware of the keen concerns raised within your Assembly by the decision to cut the funds intended for victim rehabilitation centres.
I would like, ladies and gentlemen, to briefly outline the origins of the Commission's current policy on the financing of actions against torture.
In 2001, the Commission presented a communication on human rights, which was marked by a change of direction in the matter of rehabilitation and prevention and a commitment to 'ensure that it focuses as much as possible on prevention, including through human rights education of the police and other possible agents of torture'.
The European initiative's programming document for 2002-2004 follows on from this, stressing that financing will be redirected towards longer-term prevention activities.
In a few moments, I will say a few words about how this policy has been implemented.
But first of all, I would like to explain the reasons for it.
The emphasis on prevention does not mean that the Commission sees no value in the rehabilitation of victims, quite the contrary.
The legal, social and medical assistance provided by rehabilitation centres is in our view extremely important.
However, since the funds allocated to the European initiative are limited to around EUR 100 million a year to finance four major priorities in the defence of human rights, the Commission was forced to make some harsh and difficult choices.
The communication it presented in 2001 clearly shows that the general principle of the European initiative's limited budget is to concentrate on civil and political rights and presents the European Union as the architect of change in the field of human rights.
So far as the campaign against torture is concerned, this principle means tackling the problems at source, for example by educating police forces and prison warders, by investigating the networks where instruments of torture are sold, by awareness-raising campaigns and support where major advances like the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture are made.
In short, ladies and gentlemen, combating torture means taking the necessary measures to spare the victims of tomorrow.
The decision to redirect the Union's activities more and more towards prevention has been accompanied by specific measures designed to gradually reduce the dependence of rehabilitation centres on Community resources.
Thus, since 2001 calls for proposals have attached great importance to the durability of projects during the evaluation process.
Moreover, actions aimed at strengthening centres' institutional capacities, in particular by developing their ability to mobilise funds, were explicitly eligible for financing in 2001 and 2002.
I would also like to point out that, regardless of the Community funds available, there has never been any guarantee that particular centres will receive funding during any given year.
All funding proposals are assessed by experts and given a mark using fair and transparent selection criteria.
Funds are granted only to the best proposals.
This approach must also be seen in the context of the vast network of rehabilitation centres in existence today.
The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims is itself working with some 200 centres around the world.
Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission does not have the resources to cover such needs and can only support a small number of centres each year.
Last year, for example, thirteen projects assisting torture victims inside and outside the Union received Community funds.
This aid comes in addition to other major international sources of funding, such as the Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture set up by the United Nations, to which several Member States contribute.
The Commission is currently completing work on the European initiative programme for 2004, which will give priority to the prevention of torture and to rehabilitation.
This document will be presented to Parliament in due course.
Finally, Mr President, I would like to restate that the Commission does not intend to stop overnight all funding awarded to rehabilitation centres.
The call for proposals amounting to EUR 11.5 million, targeting rehabilitation centres in the European Union, which was announced on 9 August 2003, is I think evidence enough of that.
That is what I wanted to say on this question.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with two forms of torture, which it is equally important to combat.
The first works on the pretext that it is necessary to find out certain information, for example in the case of dangerous terrorism.
The other form of torture quite clearly seeks to destroy and break people.
Obviously we reject both forms of torture in equal measure.
Unfortunately it is the case that many people think that torture is something out of the Middle Ages and a problem that in our advanced age we had overcome at the latest by the Enlightenment.
It was, however, precisely the twentieth century that in a very particular way produced cruel forms of torture and the cruel torturous regimes of Communism and National Socialism, and we have to recognise that, even at the beginning of the twenty-first century, torture regrettably continues to be a reality in many parts of the world.
In Latin America, torture has thankfully declined considerably since the 1970s and 1980s.
In Africa, there is hardly any country where torture is not practised.
In Asia, it is often precisely important European Union trading partners - who otherwise appear in pinstripes as business associates - who have perfected various forms of torture and unfortunately the issue is still relevant here in Europe.
Just a few years ago there were particularly cruel cases of torture in Kosovo.
Or look to the East, for example: thankfully the situation in Central Europe has improved - next to me is sitting my friend Figel from Slovakia, a human rights campaigner - and happily 12 years ago these nations overthrew the cruel regimes that practised torture in a democratic revolution, but in the Member States of the Council of Europe, which is meeting concurrently at the other side of the Ill, the problem still exists.
In Chechnya, for example, the Russian military is responsible for committing brutal acts of torture, and no one is talking about it.
Tomorrow in the Council of Europe, they will discuss whether to introduce monitoring for Liechtenstein.
Liechtenstein is an exemplary democracy, while in Russia, in Chechnya, torture continues to be used.
Compared with Liechtenstein, however, it is a large country, and that is why no one dares to tackle the issue.
Or take Turkey, a candidate country: it is finding it very difficult to cope with the issue of torture, and yet it also belongs to the Council of Europe and has an association agreement with the European Union.
This is not just about far-away third countries or past periods of history; it is about the reality of our foreign policy.
That is why I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that the Commission is making this issue such a high priority.
I welcome the fact that it is determined both to raise this issue at international level and to actively help the victims of torture, wherever they may come from - we still have a large number of traumatised torture victims with us in Europe precisely from the Balkans - and above all to work in the field of prevention.
I should like to lend my strong support to this initiative.
Our foreign trade policy and our human rights policy need to be joined up; the same applies to our development policy.
The time of human rights clauses in our treaties being just window-dressing is over; they must also be applied and if they really are violated then of course measures must also be taken, because just complaining, just lamenting, just criticising does not do any good.
Quite simply, practical, substantial steps also need to be taken and I do actually believe that a country in which torture continues to be used on a daily basis for the purpose of administering justice simply cannot be an appropriate economic partner for a democratic Europe.
That is why I am in favour of a dynamic policy in this field.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of recent events, I should like first of all to express my joy that Amina Lawal, who had been condemned to be stoned to death in Nigeria for adultery, has won her appeal and is no longer facing this threat.
I believe that the European Union also had a hand in this success, because it campaigned vigorously to ensure that this horrifying act did not happen.
This gives me grounds for optimism about the willingness to debate and discuss this issue within the ACP partnership, because as you know it is one that we unfortunately have to deal with in these countries.
It has, of course, been pointed out that there is no doubt that in Africa too torture is practised and that we need to address it.
What has happened in Nigeria can be seen as a kind of victory for humanity, and our cooperation with the ACP countries, which is, of course, very important to us in this House, contributed to it, as did the European Parliament's resolve.
This shows then that our policies can achieve real results.
But to comment on the issue in general: the European Union's commitment to speak up for the respect of human rights and to guarantee the inviolability of human dignity is recognised the world over.
We also spend considerable sums of money on this, but unfortunately it is never enough, given the misery prevailing in the world.
That is why, on behalf of my group, I should like to speak in favour of ensuring in particular that reliable provision is made for both prevention and rehabilitation in the future.
The world really is waiting for the European Union to continue to stand by what it has practised and to stick to its commitment, which cannot be expected from anywhere else.
It is precisely the rehabilitation centres that have been mentioned here, both within the European Union, but also outside, that must be able to have confidence that their future is secure.
They must not be allowed to get into a situation where they have as it were to live from hand to mouth and worry every year whether their work, which is tremendously important for the victims, will be able to be continued.
I should like to stress here that it is not only about offering victims somewhere to stay, a shelter, but also quite specifically about giving them access to legal assistance and psychological treatment.
This is particularly important for women, who are, as we know, subjected to particularly perfidious methods of torture.
In Bosnia, but also in other countries, we really exposed to public attention how women are victims of rape, where rape is used as a political weapon, not only as an individual shameful act, but also as a political weapon.
These women are completely broken both physically and emotionally and they need reliable support.
We are called on here to offer these people real security and therefore not only to continue the European Union's policy, which must undoubtedly be welcomed, but also to develop it further.
I will say it explicitly: this applies to both areas, to prevention and to rehabilitation.
Some aspects clearly overlap.
It is certainly right to check how cooperation is assured on an individual basis, but there should be no doubt about the European Union's commitment to providing victims of torture with a refuge here.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I should like to express thanks on behalf of our group to you - and also to Mr Patten, who cannot be here today, and his staff - for the great readiness you have shown in the past, and are also showing today, to enter into discussion with Parliament regarding the serious problem of torture.
You yourself pointed out the important distinction that is currently being made between rehabilitation of the victims on the one hand, and prevention on the other.
It is extremely important that we continue to take the rehabilitation of the victims to heart; yet we have reduced the appropriations for this by 45%.
We should like to ask you, however, whether you can assure us that we can continue to count on the funds that are currently available.
If not, we shall find ourselves in the unpleasant situation in which those involved in rehabilitation have to compete for budget resources with those working on prevention, when of course prevention, too, is an absolute necessity.
Systematic rape as a weapon in warfare is, sadly, a widespread practice. Also, it seems that the situation in which the police consider it normal to torture in order to extract certain information is still the order of the day, even in countries which are applying to join the European Union such as Turkey.
It is unacceptable that the police consider torture a normal means to an end.
I think that it is particularly good that we are also devoting attention to educating the police in this sense.
Good methods, in which humanity is the primary consideration, must be our guiding principle at all times.
I should also like to draw attention to the fact that children are being used as weapons against their parents.
I am talking here about the appalling problem of child soldiers, where a child is taken away from home in order to be subsequently used as a means of oppression, as a weapon against its own mother and father.
Commissioner, we want to work together to prevent this kind of abomination.
While this is an important tool in conflict prevention, we also want to continue to urge you not to let us lose sight of the rehabilitation of victims.
Mr President, torture in third countries can comfortably be condemned in this House - the Taliban's treatment of women is the classic example of that.
However, nobody can deny that the real test would be to match our rhetoric with concrete acts to deal with the endless stream of torture in one of the Member States - the Kingdom of Spain.
During the last four years, I have raised this issue several times and nobody in this House has reacted to support my complaints.
Particularly regrettable was the behaviour of our former President, Mrs Fontaine, firstly in January 2001, when I asked for a statement against the pardon of 15 police torturers who had already been sentenced in Spain. The President ordered that the speaker be cut off.
That happened twice in two different sittings of this House during January 2001.
And secondly, in December 2001, when I brandished a poster photograph of a tortured woman, the President reacted in the same way.
Commissioner, we have to make sure that the European Union will speak up and act to answer any complaint on torture.
It is up to the Commission to make sure that Member States comply with European law to win credibility from European citizens.
Political realism has led the European institutions to the conclusion that it is not appropriate at this stage to do anything that might endanger the political architecture of the European Union.
However, I am convinced that the majority of Europeans do not share this tolerance towards torture.
We ought not to pretend that we are doing something serious to oppose torture so long as we do not set up a more ambitious compromise, particularly denouncing by name those responsible for torture.
Unfortunately, to that extent, nothing has changed in the European Union despite a few courageous reports.
We await proposals from the Commission seeking to put in place a sensible piece of legislation to reinforce the point that torture cannot under any circumstances be tolerated.
Political and legal actions must be taken soon, because finding solutions to torture is a matter of urgency.
I very much support the emphasis of the Commission statement, though I generally believe that many people in the Basque country would consider that it does not go far enough to meet their concerns.
Mr President, I have asked for the floor because I cannot remain indifferent to the speech made by the Member who has just spoken, and I do not think there is a Spanish Member present to respond.
I cannot help feeling indignant at what I heard him say, and the best interpretation I could put on the Member's words is that it was a case of vice paying tribute to virtue.
In the end, however, it was not that.
The Member who has just spoken does not condemn torture; he does not condemn the violence that the organisation he defends metes out in Spain, kidnapping people and putting them in veritable holes, oppressing them and turning them into objects.
He protests against possible acts of torture by the Spanish state.
Mr President, the Spanish state will certainly be condemned if it commits any act of torture, and proceedings have already been brought in Spain against police and authorities who used torture against members of that organisation.
That is correct practice, democratic practice.
I cannot listen to what the Member said without protesting, because in fact what he said is the opposite of what he actually means.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would appeal to you not to begin debating this issue.
A Spanish Member of this House has asked for the floor.
I am also a Spanish Member of the House but, as President, I have tried to keep calm and will do so.
I listened to Mr Gorostiaga carefully for more than three minutes, without interrupting him, but I must tell you that I also feel indignant, because it is quite clear to all of us that Mr Gorostiaga does not condemn these attacks - do not worry, Mr Gorostiaga, you will have the floor - and what is more, he used to belong to an organisation that was, to put it politely, disbanded by the authorities of the democratic and lawful state, because of its links with a terrorist organisation.
I will say no more, but this must be included in the Minutes.
As a Spanish Member of this House, I take responsibility for my own words.
I would ask my fellow Member from Spain to leave the floor because this is the wrong type of debate for speeches like his.
Mr Gorostiaga now has 15 or 20 seconds to say whatever he sees fit, even though he has taken it upon himself to point his finger at people who are not present in the Chamber.
Mr President, on a point of order, firstly I cannot agree with the procedure followed by the President, so I protest.
Secondly, I denounce all torturers without any exception and I would like to see our Spanish colleagues doing the same thing, namely denouncing the pardon given to torturers who have been condemned as torturers.
The Spanish Government has pardoned them, so they can torture with impunity in Spain.
All our words will be included in the Minutes.
According to the Rules of Procedure, as you all know, everyone has a right to speak in this Chamber - which is called, sometimes rhetorically, a temple of democracy - and everyone assumes the moral responsibility for their words.
Mr President, I also say what I wish to say, and that is why I should first like expressly to thank Mr Posselt for not only criticising and condemning the practice of torture as such in the abstract, but also for naming specific states that sponsor torture.
I believe that this is one of the most important political points, and we should not forget it.
In our relations with third countries we should also name any states that practise torture.
He mentioned Russia and Turkey, and I am rapporteur for Iran, but that does not stop me from saying that regrettably in Iran too torture still takes place.
We address this publicly, for example in the human rights dialogue that is underway with this country.
That is why, Commissioner, I think it would have been good if you not only addressed this in individual political dialogues, that is behind closed doors, but if you too had given the names of countries that are associated with torture.
In this context, if we have evidence of torture, I think it is very important for us to withdraw privileges, for example the trade privileges enjoyed by many ACP States in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, in accordance with the precautions that we have taken in the treaties.
We have mechanisms for doing this, but it does not seem to me that we are using them in respect of the 77 ACP States, except in the case of Zimbabwe, where we have taken quite modest measures.
You mentioned a further point, namely the treatment centres for torture victims.
If I interpret what you said correctly, you were saying that you intended to stop funding these treatment centres.
You only qualified this by saying, 'not overnight', but the policy is clear.
You did also mention that there are other potential sources of funding.
This is a clear indication that this is obviously your intention.
I would urge you to rethink.
As a matter of principle, we can only withdraw if we have information that the torture has stopped or lessened, but not without that information.
That is why I am supporting a proposal that I have heard is being tabled by the Socialist Group, namely to increase budget item B5-813 by EUR 1 million.
I am also trying to enlist support for the proposal in my own group.
So we are asking for the opposite of abolishing the budget item: unfortunately at the moment a further increase.
I would ask the Commission to act in concert with us.
Mr President, I too, as chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, should like to welcome the release today of Amina Lawal, the Nigerian women sentenced to death, to a terrible death by stoning, on charges of adultery, and I should like to congratulate the Commission and my committee for putting up a fight and influencing to a very large degree the decision issued today.
We exerted the greatest possible pressure.
Nonetheless, this woman will not cease to symbolise the fight of all women the length and breadth of the planet, who are fighting for protection of their fundamental freedoms and human rights.
As far as torture is concerned, I should like, Commissioner, to warmly congratulate you on the initiatives you have taken, especially on the prevention of torture and on the funding of rehabilitation centres for the victims of torture.
Nonetheless, I trust you will allow me to philosophise a little on this issue.
Two thousand five hundred years ago in Athens, Aristotle stressed that confessions extracted under torture should not be admitted.
Another Greek sage and rhetorician, Antiphontas, also said that people subjected to torture only say what pleases their torturers.
Naturally, our contemporary experience has taught that any confession can be extracted under torture.
Victims say what the investigating magistrates want to hear and sign anything which will put a stop to the pain and torture.
It is a fact, however much of a clichÃ© it may sound, that September 11 marked an important turning point in human rights.
Acts of violence and terrorism, the fear and insecurity which were once confined to certain corners of the planet became a daily reality in many other areas, including in the western world.
Commissioner, a few years ago, we ran campaigns against the torture used by totalitarian and dictatorial regimes.
We were certain that there was no place for torture in the western world.
However, we soon realised our mistake.
We realised it when we saw Afghan prisoners with masks covering their eyes and ears in gaol on the American base in Guantanamo in Cuba, under conditions which were tantamount to torture in accordance with the opinion of one expert, Maria Kalli, the Greek president of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims to whom you referred.
At the same time, we were horrified to hear arguments from supposedly enlightened people maintaining that torture should be used in the fight against terrorism.
In other words, we are going to re-debate what we have known to be true for 2 500 years.
Nonetheless, no-one doubts that the war against terrorism produces even greater terrorism.
Unfortunately, the war against terror has turned into a war against freedom, against the freedom to travel in safety, to walk in the street, to meet people and to lead a daily life without fear and terror.
The most vivid and recent example of how violence generates even greater violence was the attack on the UN offices in Baghdad.
Today, human rights fighters and voluntary humanitarian organisations are in the line of fire as if they themselves were terrorists.
Nonetheless, Commissioner, our fight to combat violence and protect victims must not stop.
From this point of view, I congratulate you on any initiatives you take.
Mr President, first a word in response to what Mrs Karamanou has just said and to what Mrs Junker said a little earlier.
I believe that in this chamber, and outside of it of course, we are all particularly glad about the acquittal of Amina Lawal in Nigeria.
That acquittal was wanted by everyone in the world, in Europe and in the Commission - President Prodi, for example, wrote to the Nigerian authorities about it - who is concerned for respect for human rights.
We do know, moreover, that when we talk of respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty is at the heart of the struggle for human rights to be respected.
We have all abolished it in Europe, but unfortunately that is not the case in other parts of the world.
I am therefore pleased to add my support, ladies, to what you have said on this issue.
Mrs Maes raised the issue of rehabilitation or prevention, which I mentioned myself.
A few minutes ago I explained the reasons why we now want to give priority to prevention.
However, Mrs Maes, the European initiative does not make an absolute distinction between prevention and rehabilitation and does not dispute that rehabilitation centres can and must play a role in prevention.
Moreover, the 2002 call for proposals expressly allowed centres to devote 20% of their proposed budget to prevention-related activities.
To give us food for thought on the subject, furthermore, we will shortly be beginning a study of the part played by centres in this field.
Thank you, Mrs Maes, for yourself underlining - and I will tell him you did - the commitment and availability of my colleague and friend Chris Patten on this issue and many others, but especially on this subject.
I would also like to reassure Mrs Junker and Mr Galler, who spoke just now, about the support we are continuing and will continue to give to rehabilitation centres.
This point is actually part of the Union's commitments.
As I pointed out, funding for rehabilitation actions is not going to disappear in the near future.
You must bear in mind that, as I said, the European initiative is not the only source of support the European Union gives to victims of torture.
Several Member States of the European Union in fact make an important contribution themselves, through the United Nations, to the Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture, which grants aid to rehabilitation centres on an annual basis.
I wanted to make that clear in the light of the concerns you expressed just now.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the Oral Question (B5-0276/2003) by Astrid Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on difficulties encountered in European beekeeping.
Mr President, this Parliament has been trying to make the European Commission aware of the increasingly worrying situation of European beekeeping since the end of the 1980s.
In 1997, we managed to get the Commission to move a little, resulting in this 'decaffeinated' regulation to improve the production and marketing of honey, with an allocation of EUR 15 to 16 million, depending on the year, for all 15 Member States.
The Commission has never acted on this Parliament's unanimous requests to take more appropriate measures to save European beekeeping, such as the pollen-gathering premium.
For several years now, beekeeping has been faced with new problems, in particular the loss of hives because when bees have gathered pollen from certain crops they lose their sense of direction and that is just as dangerous, Commissioner, as when politicians lose the plot.
Since the Commission is turning a deaf ear to our repeated warnings despite the Council having explicitly asked it, on 18 February this year, to develop its action in this field in line with Parliament's demands, we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to ask for this oral question to be placed on the agenda with a debate and resolution on the new difficulties being encountered by European beekeeping, a resolution on which we will vote on 9 October.
On 28 April this year, the Committee on Agriculture held a hearing on these new difficulties.
In several Member States, beekeeping is in fact facing problems of large-scale mortality within bee colonies, especially in France, Mr Barnier.
Among other things, this mortality is thought to be linked to the use of certain systemic insecticides present in the seed pellets of certain large-scale crops, principally sunflower and maize.
Given that Article 174 of the Treaty on European Union, which is concerned with environmental policy, enshrines the precautionary principle as the founding principle, I think that this principle ought to be followed when there are both serious risks and uncertainties.
As perhaps you know, Einstein said that if the bee disappeared from the surface of the earth, humanity would disappear two years later.
We are therefore faced with a great problem today, as I said.
Beekeepers in many regions of different Member States have been observing increased mortality rates among bees for several years now.
The symptoms are different from those caused by the weather, for example, but they coincide with the use of new generations of neurotoxic systemic active substances used for pelleting on large-scale crops close to the hives.
That is where the uncertainty lies: both the hearing we had at the end of April and the comments and statements by my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development show that scientists do not agree.
I believe we must face the problem, not sidestep it.
Let us set up a committee of experts to get us out of this uncertainty.
Obviously, we need to avoid having double standards on the pretext of economic interests, interests which are massive, it is true: there are billions at stake.
But neither politicians nor scientists should be controlled by the interests of the powerful financial groups that have been harassing us constantly, here and in Brussels, for weeks.
The experts must work completely objectively and transparently, in a peaceful environment, and they must give us reliable and objective answers.
I will not hide from you that this week I received a very interesting report from the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study of Disorders of Bees, which is made up of eminent scientists.
That report officially records the presence of doses of substances I previously mentioned as having been found in pollen.
It has been reported to me that the firm Bayer itself, naming no names, was astonished by this new evidence.
To quote just one of these findings: the use of Gaucho for pelleting sunflower seed results in a significant risk for bees of different ages.
As with sunflower, the concentration ratio for the Gaucho pelleting of maize seed proves worrying given the consumption of pollen.
Having said that, Commissioner, there is an urgent need for action to establish the real causes of the worrying rate of mortality among bees.
In the meantime, our beekeepers need help, more funds to cope with this new crisis, whatever its origin.
I hope that the Commission will move this time, that it will take our demands seriously, that it will see that serious studies are made to get to the bottom of this crisis.
Meanwhile, as I said, we must take measures to prevent the disappearance of beekeepers with all the harmful ecological consequences that this would entail.
That is why, Commissioner, we are asking the Commission to kindly give a clear answer to the three specific questions we have put to you in the course of this debate.
Mr President, I have been well aware of your commitment to this subject for a long time, Mrs Lulling, and of your competence and strength of feeling.
In addressing me, you said these concerns were also felt in the country of which I am still a citizen.
It so happens that in my previous positions - I have not forgotten - I had to dialogue and act with the people responsible for beekeeping, often in the way you desire.
I do also understand, from the words you used, your dissatisfaction and your expectations.
Nevertheless, that is a long way from saying that we are trying to sidestep the issue, that we are turning a deaf ear or that we have lost the plot.
So I am going to try and give a serious and lucid answer to your three questions.
Turning first to Parliament's decisions about taking account of the effects on bees and public health of persistent systemic insecticides, we have indeed noted those decisions.
However, the Commission wishes to stress that any such effect is already taken into account in the evaluation of insecticides required under the directive on the placing of plant protection products on the market.
Member States are not allowed to authorise a plant protection product if it has an unacceptable effect on non-target organisms such as bees.
Moreover, an assessment of any possible effect of residues on public health is a prior condition for setting maximum levels of pesticide residues in food.
The Commission notes that most of the concerns expressed in this regard relate to two insecticides that are currently being evaluated, Mrs Lulling.
Pending the outcome of those evaluations, no decision concerning those substances has yet been taken at Community level, but the Commission is aware of risk management measures being applied in at least one Member State.
Regarding investigations into this subject, the directive does not require the studies to be conducted by the Commission itself.
On the other hand, the Commission is fully informed of the studies necessary in order to demonstrate the acceptability of particular substances.
It has been provided with information on the decline in bee populations in some Member States, as you yourself have solemnly emphasised.
At present, we are told, there is no scientific proof that this decline is due to a single factor such as pesticide use.
The Commission is also informed of research currently being undertaken by the Member States, by industry and by scientific associations under the watchful eye of the associations.
The Commission is itself following the matter very closely.
It will, of course, continue to monitor developments and will take appropriate measures in due course should that appear necessary.
Finally, Mrs Lulling, on the matter of aids under Council Regulation No 1221/97, the Commission cofinanced national programmes to improve the production and marketing of honey to the tune of 50% during the 1999/2000 marketing year.
The French programme, for example, included a study of the effects of plant protection products on bees.
The programmes for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 marketing years also provide aids for the reconstitution of bee stocks.
Finally, I would like to point out that if a Member State wishes, the Commission is, of course, willing to look at the possibility of increasing the amounts allocated to this within the overall budget, but that is, of course, up to the national authorities whose responsibility it is to make such a request.
Those are the most definite and most precise answers I can give you on the three points raised in your oral question.
Mr President, Commissioner, we all know that Mrs Lulling is not only the European Parliament's queen of wine but also its queen bee.
I should like to thank her very warmly for this commitment, because we should be aware that this has been a matter of concern to the European Parliament for decades.
Back in the 1980s, the Bavarian Member of Parliament and pan-European, Heinrich Aigner, who sadly is no longer with us, brought together hundreds of Bavarian beekeepers to inject some impetus into this issue.
We have been working on it for 30 years, and unfortunately we have not made a great deal of progress.
I have to say quite clearly, Commissioner, that I am grateful to you for your precise answers and for taking this important issue so seriously, because an ecological crisis is slowly developing in this sector.
In Bavaria and Austria huge numbers of bee colonies died in the spring frosts, but also of course because of insecticides and diseases, and we are feeling the ecological effects very keenly, for example with our fruit.
That is why I really believe that now is the time to promote something that is under serious threat, namely passing on beekeeping to the next generation.
A very high proportion of beekeepers are old, because fewer and fewer people from the younger generation are prepared to take on this arduous, but ecologically necessary, task, not least because the financial rewards are ever more meagre.
That is why I should like to say quite clearly that I - like Mrs Lulling - call for all measures to be taken to support the marketing of natural European honey ahead of cheap, undeclared artificial honey, with which we have repeatedly had to contend, or honey from abroad.
I would also call for something that is always the subject of some ridicule, but which is ecologically important, namely the pollination premium for colonies of bees, so that we promote this activity by giving beekeepers more support.
I should particularly like to thank you, Commissioner, for your examples from France, which plays a leading role in this sector.
Your country also has a former agriculture minister for president and it is a country, which, thank God, takes healthy eating and delicious food very seriously.
I actually believe that we in Europe should finally see this issue, which is regarded by some perhaps as a bit of a joke, for what it is, namely a health issue and a prerequisite for a functioning environment and ecological system.
Mr President, in putting this oral question on the pressing problem of the large-scale mortality of bees to the Commission, my colleagues Dominique Souchet and Astrid Lulling are once again sounding the alarm and I back them strongly in this.
Quite extraordinary problems of declining bee colonies have been observed in France for several years now, since 1995 to be precise.
The situation is getting worse by the year, the geographical area and the number of hives affected is constantly growing and now we can say that many countries of Europe are affected.
It seems on investigation that this bee mortality is not the result of a conventional pathology.
Several other hypotheses have been examined, such as climate, general pollution or the incorrect use of plant protection products.
While these may sometimes carry some of the responsibility, however, they are far from accounting for the full scale of the disaster.
On this point I do not agree with the opinion you have just expressed, Commissioner.
According to experts and professionals, one principal cause has in fact been identified: the environment around the hives, when it includes fields of honey plants, colza, sunflower, maize, the seed of which has been treated with insecticides of the Gaucho or Regent type.
Of course, the industrial manufacturers reply that the link has not been formally established, but experience clearly shows that the disorders afflicting bees - loss of sense of direction, shaking, inability to gather pollen and finally death - correlate perfectly with the presence nearby of crops grown from seed treated with Gaucho or Regent.
The more observations are made, the more these findings are confirmed.
However, nothing decisive has yet come from the authorities apart from reassuring words, the launching of studies and a few limited measures such as the temporary withdrawal of the authorisation for Gaucho to treat sunflower seed in France.
That is why, again at the instigation of Dominique Souchet and Astrid Lulling, the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture arranged a hearing on the subject on 28 April last.
The lessons we have drawn from that are alarming because the problem affecting bees could well be only the most visible part of a wider problem affecting pollinating insects, entomofauna and soil fauna.
Gaucho and Regent molecules could therefore be harmful not only to bees but to a much wider environment.
Let us not stop there, either.
Since these molecules are present in agricultural products used in food or animal feed, we should also be concerned about our own health.
That is why, faced with this risk of widespread poisoning of the ecosystem - and perhaps of man - we are insisting that the precautionary principle be applied.
I heard the Commission's answers to Mr Souchet's and Mrs Lulling's oral question just now.
I believe it is taking too much of a wait-and-see attitude.
In our view, the precautionary principle means banning the use of the products in question, at least on all honey plants.
Measures should also be taken to compensate beekeepers and enable them to repopulate their hives.
Mr President, I will respond briefly to the few comments that have been made.
Contrary to what may have been said, the Commission takes very seriously this question that Mrs Lulling has vehemently and competently defended and that Mr Souchet put with her.
Frankly, if some of you have the impression that no serious scientific work has been done on plant protection products and their consequences for bees, then I believe you are mistaken.
Work on the substances in question has been going on for several years.
The International Commission on Plant-Bee Relations, whose particular brief it is to examine the dangers threatening bees, has just held an international symposium in Bologna on the subject.
Its findings are that the deterioration in the health of bees and the reduced performance of colonies observed in a number of countries probably do not have such a simple, single cause.
Other potential sources - certain parasitoses, certain farming practices and weather conditions - may have harmful effects on the health of bees just as much as plant protection and veterinary products.
You mentioned the ecosystem, Mr Berthu.
I would remind you that I have a longstanding commitment in this area.
As a former environment minister in my country, I am sensitive to this question.
The symposium agreed to form a working party to look into the deteriorating health of bees.
The working party will report to the next symposium, which will be held in 2005.
I confirm that the Commission will be following this work closely and will draw a number of definite conclusions from it.
Mr Posselt, whom I thank for his opinion, regretted that fewer and fewer young people are taking up this wonderful rural occupation of beekeeping.
I simply want to confirm that national programmes concerning honey provide funding for technical assistance to encourage young people to become beekeepers and improve their results.
Thank you, Commissioner.
Mrs Lulling wishes to provide the sting in the tail.
Mr President, the Commissioner has said that the Commission has no scientific proof of the correlation between bee mortality and the use of new generation pesticides.
I would like to tell the Commissioner that I have at his disposal the report of the Scientific and Technical Committee on the Multifactorial Study of Disorders of Bees, to which I referred in my introduction and which demonstrates that correlation.
This report is at your disposal, Commissioner, and we shall meet again on 9 October, when we will be discussing the draft resolution on which the Committee on Agriculture will be voting next week in conclusion of this debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be on 9 October 2003.
I should like to inform the House that Lord Bethell has informed me of his resignation, with effect from 30 September 2003.
In accordance with Rule 8(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the House takes note of this vacancy.
Mr President, I do not want to delay the House, but it would inappropriate if I did not mark that particular announcement on behalf of the whole House.
Lord Bethell has been a popular and hard-working Member of this House for very many years.
His service has been appreciated by all sides of the House.
We recall his work on human rights in the Soviet Union when it was at the height of its powers.
He brought the plights of Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov to widespread public attention.
This Parliament's Sakharov Prize is something he played a key role in instituting.
He also had a direct role in air liberalisation, so he has had a direct effect upon consumers throughout the European Union.
I believe that every politician would hope to be in a position in which, in their lifetime, they could have made at least some difference on behalf of their constituents.
For the people of Europe, Lord Bethell can say that he has been a politician who has made a difference.
He will be greatly missed by all sides of the House.
I should also like to inform the House that Mrs Maij-Weggen has been appointed Royal Commissioner for North Brabant Province in the Netherlands.
She has informed me of her resignation with effect from 1 October 2003.
I should like to congratulate her on her appointment.
In accordance with Rule 8(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the House takes note of the vacancy.
I have been informed by the competent Slovak authorities that Jozef Heriban has been appointed as observer in place of Imrich BÃ©res, with effect from 9 September 2003.
The next item is the vote.
Report (A5-0244/2003) by Karl von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Council's Fourth annual report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports (2003/2010(INI))
(Parliament adopted the text)
President.
That concludes the vote.
The von Wogau report therefore proposes regulating arms exports and making them more ethical.
One might as well try to make murder, plunder or abduction more ethical.
The simple fact that the great powers are wasting enormous sums of money on weapons of mass destruction shows that the present organisation of society is barbaric.
The governments of the great nations, who are responsible for criminal wars from Iraq to Afghanistan and accomplices of state terrorism in Palestine, would like to deny a number of smaller countries, whose regimes they do not like, access to weapons. They would like to do the same to certain organisations described by them as terrorist, and to the world of organised crime.
Even that, however, is proving impossible.
In an economy where arms dealers are willing to sell the rope to hang themselves if it makes them a profit, how can they be prevented from bypassing government controls?
When the report welcomes the French initiative concerning the submission of a proposal for an International Code on Transparency, moreover, or refers to the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, that is both odious and ludicrous, since those countries are among the world's leading arms exporters and are periodically shaken by politico-financial scandals involving highly placed politicians and arms dealers.
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
(The sitting was closed at 4.40 p.m.)
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 25Â September 2003.(1)
Â Â  I am delighted to have the opportunity this afternoon to extend a warm welcome to Dr Jong-Wook Lee, the recently-elected Director-General of the World Health Organization, and his colleagues, who are in the official gallery this afternoon.
It is Dr Lee's first visit to the European Parliament.
I should like to thank you for being here, Dr Lee, and, through our respective mandates, I very much look forward to working with you in the future.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I would also like to welcome to our official gallery the Swedish Riksdag's Committee on the Constitution, its Chairman Mr Gunnar HÃ¶kmark and Vice-Chairman Mr GÃ¶ran Magnusson.
Our colleagues from the Swedish Riksdag are very welcome here.
I know they have already had a busy round of meetings this morning which will continue this afternoon and tomorrow morning.
I should like to point out to you that this is the tenth committee delegation this year to come to the European Parliament from the Riksdag.
We have great pleasure in welcoming you here, and our door is always open to do business with parliamentary colleagues.(1)
Â Â  A corrigendum to the agenda of the sittings of 8 and 9 October 2003 has been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  â Mr President, the next item on the agenda is the oral question on the liberal professions.
At the Conference of Presidents no agreement could be reached on a motion for a resolution to accompany this oral question.
There have since been further discussions, and I think there is now a majority in this House in favour of an accompanying resolution.
I would therefore like to propose voting on a resolution in the next Strasbourg week and would suggest that we set a deadline of 12 noon on Thursday of next week for the submission of motions for a resolution.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I would like you to join with me in welcoming the 'Responsible consumption' week that is taking place in Brussels this week, and which is being promoted throughout the European Parliament's buildings.
Responsible consumption means that consumers are able to exercise choice in favour of ethically produced or fair-trade products, where the rights of workers are respected and where a social premium is paid to aid poor farmers and other producers in developing countries where goods are sourced.
This Parliament has played a major role in forcing the issue of corporate social responsibility onto the European agenda, and fair-trade is a very important part of that.
President, would you please thank the Quaestors for agreeing that this should take place in the Parliament this week, Oxfam World shops for running the stalls around Parliament and also other organisations such as the Fairtrade Foundation and Tradecraft Exchange from my own country who are supporting it.
Would you please join with me in encouraging all Members of this House to choose fair-trade coffee and other food and goods that are temptingly available to us in the bars and restaurants of this Parliament throughout this week.
Â Â  Mr Howitt, we shall pass on your gratitude to all those you mentioned.
Â Â  Mr President, with reference to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure of this House I want to draw attention to a statement made quite recently in the Scottish Parliament in which a Conservative Member of that Parliament said, in relation to the chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries, that âit is incumbent upon him to represent the views of the UK Government in relation to the Constitution, and the fact that it might enshrine the common fisheries policyâ.
This was in relation to the draft Constitution and Mr Stevenson's rapporteurship of a report on the subject.
Can you perhaps confirm, Mr President, that under Rule 2, no member may receive a binding mandate, and further that it is certainly not incumbent on the chairman of any Committee to receive a mandate from any government - be it Edinburgh, London, Madrid or wherever.
Could you perhaps also confirm that MrÂ Stevenson is in fact free to stand up for Scotland if he wishes to.
Â Â  I can certainly confirm, as you remarked, that Rule 2 deals with the independence of the mandate of Members of this House, and that Members of this House exercise that mandate independently, as I know our colleague Mr Stevenson normally does.
Â Â  Mr President, as I have already pointed out in this Chamber, there is a ban in Latvia on the activities of the Communist Party, on communist propaganda and on the use of communist symbols.
Five hundred thousand Russian-speaking residents, or 40% of the population, who have no citizenship, are excluded from political life.
Anyone who failed to leave the Communist Party of Latvia eight months before the break-up of the Soviet Union does not have the right to stand for election or to work in the public sector.
Thus, for example, the communist leader Alfreds Rubiksx, who is today chairman of the Socialist Party, is prohibited from standing for election, despite the fact that his party is represented in parliament.
Finally, monuments to the SS are being erected with public aid and support at a time when the veterans of the anti-Fascist war are banned from wearing the decorations which they won in the war and some of them are being jailed precisely because they took part in the anti-Fascist war.
I wanted to take advantage of the presence in the Chamber tomorrow of the President of the Republic of Latvia and her celebratory speech, to highlight this unacceptable state of affairs, which I had the chance to see for myself, and to call on you to refer to this state of affairs during the discussions which you will be holding with her.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as you will be aware, two days ago, an Italian missionary, Annalena Tonelli, was barbarically killed in Somalia in Africa.
This woman had, for 30 years, dedicated her life to helping the sick, for which she received praise and support from the entire population and from the Islamic community itself.
This barbaric murder has had an enormous impact in my country, particularly because of the extraordinary humanitarian work done by the victim.
I would like to ask you, MrÂ President, if you would convey the condolences of this House both to the family and to Italyâs institutions on this tragic, sudden death.
Â Â  Today, on behalf of Parliament, I issued a statement on this matter.
I shall provide you with a copy and I am happy also to communicate with Ms Tonelli's family.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to express surprise that in this plenary session we are not able to discuss the severe blackout that recently occurred in Italy.
Citizens throughout the Union, and especially those affected by such an event, would expect the matter to be raised as a matter of urgency.
We have now asked Mrs De Palacio to come and discuss this with us in committee, but that is no substitute for a statement from the Commission or, indeed, in the light of the trans-frontier nature of what happened, from the Council.
We need to address the question of the security of electricity supplies and the single market as a matter of urgency.
I just wanted to register extreme surprise that we were not able to discuss the matter in this plenary session.
As a result we are not serving the citizens of the Union.
Â Â  Nobody raised this during the Order of Business today, which could have allowed us to test the will of the House on the matter.
We may, however, be able to discuss the wider implications of it during the debate on the preparation of the European Council on 16-17 October, because it is clearly a cross-border issue.
Colleagues may thus, during that debate, make some points on this matter if they wish.
Â Â  Mr President, I just want to take a minute to introduce the House to Kanga, a very special guest from Australia.
She is a very cute toy kangaroo, but she has come to the European Parliament today with a very serious message: to raise awareness about sudden unexplained death in children over one and adults.
Many of you will have heard of cot death, which is when babies die unexpectedly, but you may be less aware that many other people die, after the age of one, and often the families get no explanation of their deaths.
In my own country alone, eight people die each week in this manner.
The family is left with questions as to why that person died and what should they do about it.
They get very few answers.
What we can do in the European Parliament is ask the World Health Organisation and I am pleased that the Director-General is here in Brussels today to give this syndrome a recognised name and a recognised code so that more research can take place across borders.
We could find out how many people are dying in this way and perhaps come up with reasons why.
I will be sending colleagues a copy of this letter, addressed to the World Health Organisation, requesting this code.
I hope they will sign it.
This will mean that many families across Europe will have some comfort that some research is going to be carried out into this tragic illness.
After today, Kanga is moving on to the Scottish Parliament and to parliaments and elected assemblies all over the world with her message that we must do something more to get to the bottom of why people die in this manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I am asking for your intervention in order to stop the threats against the lives of the journalists Sener Levent and Ali Osman of the Turkish Cypriot newspaper by members of the Grey Wolves extremist organisation in northern Cyprus.
The and its editor are being threatened with muzzling and this is a serious blow to the freedom of the press and of expression in the Turkish Cypriot community.
There are well-founded fears that, in the run-up to the elections in occupied Cyprus in December, this type of attack will intensify and that terrorism and fear will prevent the democratic, Europhile voices of the Turkish Cypriot community from being heard.
I call for your intervention, with the special sensitivity which you, as a veteran journalist, also have on issues of freedom of the press and, likewise, I call for Parliament to be informed systematically by the European Commission and its representation in Cyprus about similar issues.
Â Â  I am happy to follow that up positively, Mrs Zorba.
Thank you for raising the matter.
Â Â  â I would like to draw this Houseâs attention to the fact that a military coup took place not long ago in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.
This coup was carried out against an elected president.
Any coup or movement against a democratically elected political representative must always be condemned unequivocally.
Admittedly, the situation in Guinea-Bissau was already abnormal, since the Peopleâs National Assembly had been dissolved and the process of electing a new assembly was proving increasingly difficult.
A transitional charter had been laid down, however, as had an undertaking to restore democracy in Guinea-Bissau, that small and almost unknown country in the Gulf of Guinea.
MrÂ President, I would like to ask you and the Community institutions not to neglect this small country entirely, and to provide a substantial aid package in order to restore democracy and for democratic elections to be held.
Guinea-Bissau needs aid in order to hold these elections, because there is a shortage of everything there, even of money to finance the electoral process.
More than that, though, this small nation also needs aid for development, peace, progress, and to ensure that its people will no longer suffer from violence and uncertainty about the future.
Â Â  Mr President, last Sunday a demonstration took place in Zaragoza against the National Hydrological Plan, one of the many we have been organising in Aragon.
Almost 100 000 people attended.
It was the first demonstration at which more than a third of the population â almost 35% of the inhabitants of Aragon, including people of over 90 years old and babies of under a year â were present to demonstrate their rejection of the National Hydrological Plan.
As a native of Aragon, I would ask you to communicate to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m our gratitude for her willingness to enter into dialogue and her constant work.
Nevertheless, this has not been the attitude of the Spanish Prime Minister.
I would ask you to communicate to the Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, that we want him to change this intransigent and authoritarian position, and to sit down and talk to the legitimate representative of all Aragonese people, the Government of Aragon.
Mr President, the overwhelming majority of Aragonese people do not want to be plundered.
We therefore defend, and will continue to defend wherever necessary, our position of âno diversionâ.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication on the full integration of cooperation with ACP states into the budget of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject of the European Development Fund (EDF), which provides aid to countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific region, and its integration into the European Community budget, is not new to this House.
Parliament has repeatedly called for the Fund to be integrated, and has always supported proposals in this direction.
It therefore gives me great pleasure to be able to inform you that today the Commission has adopted a communication proposing a complete transfer of the European Development Fund to the Community budget with effect from the next financial perspective.
The Commission is proposing this move because we are convinced that budgetisation will help to increase the effectiveness of aid given to ACP countries, speed up and improve the implementation of that aid, and provide efficiency gains for all parties involved in the process.
The proposal is fully in line with the promises made by the European Union at various summits over the past year.
At Monterey, for example, the European Union committed itself to increasing total aid to developing countries and to improving processing and coordination, thereby increasing effectiveness.
Parliament is very familiar with the subject of integrating the European Development Fund into the Community budget, and has repeatedly spoken in favour of such a move, one that the Commission has also favoured for a long time.
The first proposal on the subject was tabled back in 1973 â 30 years ago â and the idea has been raised several times since, most recently in 1993.
The Member States, however, were never able to agree on how to transfer this special instrument, which has been in place since 1958, to the budget.
The Development Fund is special because it is financed directly by the Member States and in accordance with a specific formula.
Nevertheless, it is the Commission that is responsible for the administration of the Fund. Here too, however, different rules apply to those used for other foreign policy instruments.
Whilst Parliament has the right and the obligation to give discharge to the Development Fund, it is not involved in determining the amounts involved or what the aid is used for.
Why are we again proposing integrating this non-budgetary fund structure into the Community budget now, in 2003?
There are two basic reasons.
Firstly, the proposal will benefit all parties, in particular the recipient countries.
Secondly, the Commission is convinced that now is the right time, the right opportunity, for this proposal to reappear on the agenda.
I would like to deal with the second of the two reasons first: the right time and circumstances.
Three factors have come together.
Firstly there is the proposal for reforming the Treaties; the preparatory work carried out by the Convention specifically supported the budgetisation of the EDF, and the constitution it proposed would allow this to be done.
The second important factor is enlargement of the European Union.
It was agreed in the accession negotiations that the new Member States would not yet contribute to the existing Fund but would participate in negotiations on its successor.
The third element is the proposed new EU financial framework for the period following 2006, which is currently under discussion.
The communication agreed on today is therefore a practical feature of the new financial package that the Commission is proposing.
Just as important as this window of opportunity, however, are the considerations that I shall now set out.
Inclusion of the EDF in the budget would benefit the ACP countries; it would boost the political effectiveness of EU aid and help make the administration of the aid more efficient.
The current system of five-yearly negotiations outside the budget system increasingly carries the risk of ACP states being somewhat sidelined politically.
The advantage for ACP countries is that with integration in the budget, the aid would instead repeatedly be on the agenda.
The development programmes included in the budget with their annual performance reviews â including by Parliament â actually encourage more efficient processing of aid.
It would be also easier to account for existing staff within the Community budget rather than under the current Fund system.
How would this make EU aid more effective?
Within the framework of the EDF, a strong partnership approach has been developed, which should definitely be maintained, as should the principle of ownership and the principle of focusing on eradicating poverty, but it would be far better to create synergies between the various programmes which the European Union budget funds and which also benefit ACP countries.
In addition, funding for global aid programmes such as the Global Health Fund could be used better if the Fund were included in the budget.
Administrative procedures would be simplified since there would no longer be two separate systems existing in parallel with each other, with two different financial regulations, two sets of implementing rules, and two different accounting standards.
Instead, by harmonising the systems, we would increase efficiency, not only within the Commission services, but also for the authorities in the beneficiary countries and for all those who are involved in implementing the aid.
You see, we have to be aware that non-governmental organisations, for example, have to deal with two separate systems, which obviously generates a great deal of paperwork and inefficiency.
What arguments could be put forward opposing the proposal?
The ACP countries could possibly be worried that their particular concerns would be forced into second place by other foreign policy priorities, such as crisis situations.
We have to allay these fears and the Commission has indeed done so in its communication.
For one thing, the aid programme will be guaranteed by a regulation, to be enacted using the codecision procedure, which would include details of the resources to be provided over a given period.
Our experience with the budgetary programmes has also shown that the pluriannual approach to aid and the principle of annuality definitely need to be reconciled.
The Commission has not made any firm proposals today about budget figures for the next few years.
These will have to be fixed during the forthcoming discussions on the next financial perspective.
Nevertheless, the Commission has proposed a number of important measures to protect future funding levels.
The current level of aid, for example, will set the minimum for the future, while future economic performance should determine further developments.
Obviously the finance ratios will also feature in future debates â especially in the Council, of course.
The financing ratios have to be renegotiated for each new Fund.
Consequently the current ratios do not represent any guarantee of future EDF spending.
One major benefit the Commission foresees in integrating the EDF into the European budget is that there would no longer be these separate negotiations on the funding ratios for each new Fund.
The European Union provides half of all public development aid worldwide.
Last year the European Union provided EUR 31 billion of a total EUR 60 billion in development aid, a figure that includes aid from the Member States along with Community funding.
There are currently three sources of Community aid: the Community budget, the European Investment Bank instruments and, of course, the European Development Fund.
By including the European Development Fund within the Community budget, European aid would become more visible, and could be more coherently presented; this would represent another important step in the process of strengthening the European Unionâs international role.
In order to take this step, a range of proposals for the necessary legal and political implementation need to be submitted and approved in the coming months.
The Commission is relying on Parliamentâs support for these proposals.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Mr President, as the Commissioner knows, the European Parliament very much welcomes the analysis that she has given us here today.
However, what I feel is missing, Commissioner, is a lack of a clear assurance or guarantee about the protection of EDF funds within the Community budget.
One thing that was also missing from your remarks was a reference to the need to have the agreement of the ACP to this arrangement.
I would not expect the ACP countries to accept any situation that they felt gave them less leverage and less influence over decision-making as regards the EDF.
I would like to know how you intend to ring-fence.
You said you were not quite ready to do this, but the diversion of EDF money towards other European priorities is something that we have been used to in the past.
We have experienced it and we are very keen to avoid that happening in new circumstances.
Commissioner, would you consider a new additional heading for development in the financial perspectives?
Also, would you be prepared to suggest this in the proposal on the next financial perspectives for the end of 2003?
Â Â  It is, of course, essential that this proposal be discussed in detail with the ACP countries, and such discussion should also cover many features of the EDF that are laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, for example, I would suggest, the partnership approach and also the principle of concentrating on poverty eradication.
I also share your view that the ACP states will be persuaded to agree to this sort of proposal, which we hope will improve efficiency, only if we can provide sufficient guarantees that it is not just an excuse to reduce the resources available for development aid.
How can we provide that kind of guarantee?
The Commission has specifically addressed this issue in its communication, stating that the current figure should set the minimum for the future.
How could this be guaranteed within the budget?
It could be done by including details of the financial envelope in the legal basis for a multiannual programme.
The Commission is not suggesting that a new heading should be included in the financial perspective.
Instead we feel it would be beneficial if it were made clear within the structures of the financial perspective that different instruments are available for foreign policy and also for development aid.
At the same time, by guaranteeing the financial envelope in the legal basis, we would ring-fence the funding, making it impossible for the synergy gains to trigger a reduction in the resources available.
In the communication published today, the Commission has even proposed that the future evolution of EDF aid should be determined by general economic developments.
This amounts to a positive statement, one that must also be viewed in the context of the commitments made at Monterey.
That part of development aid which is financed from the budget, or will be in future, is obviously just a small fraction of the promised 0.39% of annual GNP, but I think that fraction should be guaranteed.
Of course I cannot predict now whether that figure will be increased as a result of the financial negotiations.
Â Â  That concludes the item.
As the Council is not present we will suspend the sitting for a few minutes.
Â Â  âAs the Council still cannot attend, I propose to amend the agenda slightly and the next item is the oral question (B5-0278/2003), by Klaus-Heiner Lehne and others on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on market regulations and competition rules for the liberal professions.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner Monti for responding at such short notice.
This has the advantage of allowing us to deal with this oral question under a slightly more âprominentâ section of the agenda rather than in discussions in the small hours.
I am grateful that things have turned out this way.
In fact, this oral question relates to a very important matter, namely the fact that over many centuries the Member States of the European Union have developed liberal professions, which are expected to fulfil certain specific roles.
For example, lawyers are required to administer justice, and a notaryâs duties include the drawing up of public instruments, while some professions have to obey very specific professional rules, as is the case with medical practitioners, pharmacists and many other liberal professions, where comparable rules and special structures exist.
Let me say that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have been somewhat concerned by certain developments in Commission policy on the liberal professions over the years.
I am thinking of the debate, for example, that we held some years back on the money-laundering Directive.
We always have the impression that the Commission includes those who would like to apply to the liberal professions all those rules that hold for, say, supermarkets.
That will not work, though, precisely because the professional structures all have their own particularities and these professions also have special public duties.
They therefore require different treatment to normal market players who either buy or sell a given product on the market.
In view of recent developments â one being the study by the Vienna Institute for Advanced Studies, which came out some months ago â we would like to know how the Commission plans to address this issue in future.
We have actually heard that the Commission intends to undertake a broad consultation of all the sectors involved in the question, and we would naturally also be interested to hear what steps the Commission plans to take after the consultation exercise.
The questions we have tabled focus on this aspect, and I think it would be very helpful if Commissioner Monti could also take a clear position on this subject today in his answers to this oral question.
This could put an end to a lot of the uncertainty among the liberal professions and provide clarity.
In our discussions on the agenda, Commissioner, we have already agreed that, in the next Strasbourg part-session, we also want Parliament to do what we did a few years ago, and approve a resolution to this effect.
That should then give you some kind of yardstick for judging the views of this House on the very sensitive question of the liberal professions.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission fully recognises the role that the liberal professions can play in making the European Unionâs economy more competitive, thus helping to achieve the objectives set by the Lisbon European Council.
The Commission certainly believes that the undoubted competence of the professions and their ability to establish relationships of mutual trust with their clients are vital factors in the success of members of the liberal professions, and engender a high level of satisfaction amongst their clients in Europe.
It is with this in mind that the Commission has adopted a number of initiatives designed, as has already been mentioned, to ensure that the general interest is fully protected and, in particular, to guarantee a high level of independence and of professional ethics in this sector.
The recent Wouters judgment of 19Â February 2002 and the issue of safeguarding customersâ rights are also relevant here.
In March 2003, we initiated an evaluation process with a view to forming an overall picture of regulation of the liberal professions and its effects across the countries of the European Union.
This exercise takes two aspects into account: firstly, precisely because the liberal professions have a key impact on the competitiveness of other sectors, it is important to consider the economic consequences that regulation may have on production and on efficiency, price levels and employment; secondly, as the authors of the question have implied, it is vital to take into account non-economic aspects and accordingly to accurately assess the justification for various types of regulation.
If the result is that some of this regulation goes beyond what can be objectively justified in order to guarantee high-quality services, on the one hand, and to protect consumer interests, on the other hand, the Commission, and also, I am sure, the members of the liberal professions themselves, will have to do everything in their power to ensure that these forms of regulation are reviewed.
We are in the process of analysing the contribution of the liberal professions and of consumers to this assessment exercise.
MrÂ Lehne, on 28Â October 2003, a hearing of interested parties will be heldÂ â the hearing that you, yourself, referred toÂ â and we trust that, on that occasion, we will be able to pull together a wide range of views from all quarters.
Of course, if any Members of the European Parliament wish to take part, they will be more than welcome.
I am sure that the debates will be of a high quality, and that they will enable us to gain a better understanding of how the professions operate.
Your opinions, if you wish to participate, will certainly add to the quality of the debate.
Lastly, MrÂ President, I would like to remind the House that, in response to a proposal from my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, the Commission, on 7Â March 2002, adopted a proposal for a directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, the main aim of which, in view of the decisions of the Lisbon European Council, is to consolidate the 15 existing directives in this area and to increase the mobility of skills.
This proposal is currently before this House at first reading.
Without addressing the issue of professional qualifications, which remains an area in which the Member States have primary competence, the proposal aims to facilitate the provision of services to clients in any other Member State by members of the liberal professions with a qualification from a given Member State.
At the same time, the Commission is exploring -Â in a wider context and in line with the strategy for the internal market in financial servicesÂ - a coherent approach to overcoming the persisting obstacles to the provision of cross-border services, with the exception of those related merely to recognition of professional qualifications.
Of course, if the Commission were to bring forward a new proposal in this area which also covered cross-border services provided by members of the liberal professions, it would take due account of the general interest objectives at stake and, especially, of the particular importance of independence and of professional ethics for these professions.
By way of conclusion, while reiterating its commitment to respecting the regulation and the restrictive self-regulation that apply to the liberal professions, and which can be justified on grounds of general interest, the Commission believes that it has a duty to increase its endeavours to create a level playing field for qualified professionals, so as to increase cross-border mobility and promote healthy competition, in the interests of both the professions themselves and consumers.
If I may use your own expression, MrÂ Lehne, we are all aware that supermarket rules are neither appropriate nor sufficient here.
This is a very special sector which we do, however, consider could benefit from a critical review of its existing regulatory framework.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the relationship between the free market and the liberal professions is not a straightforward one, as Commissioner Monti has made clear.
As you know, MrÂ Lehne, MrÂ ZappalÃ  and other Members have been working in my committee for over a year on a directive on professional qualifications, and we are, therefore, very familiar with the specific, exceptional nature of the liberal professions.
Members of the liberal professions offer an independent service based on an extremely high level of knowledge on which it is difficult to place a value.
For this reason, professional activities are regulated by an ethical code covering relationships between professionals, between professionals and their clients, and between professionals and society as a whole.
The behaviour of professionals is governed by an ethical framework covering their precise duties and the requirements of the service determined by professionals themselves, and this ethical framework therefore represents the first step towards regulation in terms of interpretation and application.
A sociologist from the United States, Fredson, demonstrates in his work that the system of the professions corresponds to the work ethic, which has to strike a fair balanceÂ â and I agree with Commissioner Monti on this âÂ between profit and the implementation of rules, which are the hallmarks of the market and of bureaucracy.
This, in itself, is exceptional.
Members of the liberal professions need to be granted a special status in order to maintain this delicate and difficult balance, not just in their own interest but also in the interest of society as a whole.
Furthermore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in Article 5, freedom to choose an occupation, stipulates that everyone has the right to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation, and freedom to choose an occupation is different from free enterprise.
As stated in the Treaty, Commissioner Monti, the general interest mission of the liberal professions may also justify certain limits to the rules of competition.
For this reason, legislation and the ethical regulatory framework may provide for exemptions from competition law in specific cases: in relation to professional fees, which may be mandatory, being set by the state; as regards an integrated approach to exercising the profession; in relation to advertising, where ethical codes may rule out the possibility of professionals passing judgment on each other; as regards membership of social insurance institutions; as regards mandatory membership of pension funds, which is accepted; and as regards exclusive rights for certain regulated professions.
When all is said and done, Mr President, the rules that are necessary for each specific profession to ensure that profession's impartiality, competence, integrity and responsibility for funds are not considered to be constraints on competition.
The activities of the liberal professions should, therefore, ensure that professionals and the services that they provide help to offer positive solutions to the challenges that we face, thus protecting the general interest of society at large.
The standards drawn up by professional associations under their own responsibility, with a view to safeguarding the quality of service provided, guarantee that such rules are observed in accordance with the conventions of professionalism and professional ethics.
I accordingly believeÂ â and this reflects Commissioner Monti's statementÂ â that, in this way, and solely by virtue of the delicate balance that we have to strike between profit and ethics, a fair relationship can be established between the free market, competition, regulation and ethics in general.
Â Â  Mr President, the previous speakers have highlighted the special characteristics of the liberal professions and the need for differentiated legislation.
Well, as Commissioner Monti has stressed, this differentiated legislation must be produced within a free market, in which clients normally have the possibility of choosing their professionals and furthermore can expect certain standards of behaviour.
We should prevent one danger: that of maintaining professional organisations in the field of the liberal professions as a kind of medieval body, which it is very difficult to join, and above all that this type of professional organisation should prevent the free movement of people within the European Union.
In other words, the two objectives, that of free access for clients or users to the liberal professions in any country of the Union, furthermore with the right to a system of a general nature, and also the right of access for professionals of one country to another country of the European Union, must be guaranteed.
And within this context, the specific regulations for the liberal professions should be aimed, firstly, at guaranteeing discipline within those professions.
In many cases, this is not the case. And it would be rather unfortunate for the Commission to imagine that the functioning of the professions is guaranteed by the professional organisations, if we then discovered that, in many cases, the ethical standards of the professions in question are not truly regulated within that profession.
And many of us are aware of examples in all the liberal professions.
I therefore believe that the Commissioner has made a very balanced analysis and furthermore I must congratulate him on his initiative to hold a hearing with the participation of people from the different sectors, but I hope that they are not just members of the professions, but also representatives of various sectors â industrial sectors, users, consumers â so that all aspects may be taken into account.
Ultimately, I believe that a new regulation will be required, a rather specialised regulation, for the liberal professions, but that regulation must not run counter to the general rules of the European Union.
As Commissioner Monti has said, we are not talking about a supermarket one cannot go into a supermarket to buy the services of a doctor but, within a market context, clients also have the right to benefit from the possibility, for example, of competition within a sector in which there are more professionals than there is demand for them.
The supply and demand mechanism can also act as a selection factor, in that clients will normally go to those liberal professionals who offer them the best conditions, including prices.
But if we establish an excessively closed regulation, if the conditions for access for clients are too strict, the clients will find themselves trapped as a result of the existence of these organisations and the prices they set, and they will not even have the opportunity to take action against them.
I therefore believe that the Commissioner has dealt with the problem very well: we must seek a balance so that the special requirements of these professions for which we all want very high ethical standards, for which the main responsibility falls to the liberal professionals themselves by means of their organisations do not prejudice the client, the consumer or the user.
The client must have the right of access to legal rules and judicial and administrative bodies, with the aim of guarantee that services are protected as far as possible and that, within the context of the requirements indicated by Mr Gargani and Mr Lehne, we can guarantee free competition, both within each of the countries of the Union and across the Union's borders.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, every time anyone calls for liberalisation and talks about the need to pursue such liberalisation, their opponents raise the issue of specificity.
When the liberalisation of a sector that provides a public service is discussed, people say that the sector in question is of a specific nature which needs to be taken into account and which means that the market rules applying to other economic and industrial sectors cannot be applied to this particular sector.
The same goes for the liberal professions: all the professions have their own specific characteristics.
But the hallmark of the liberal professions in Europe, and, particularly, in some countries such as Italy, is that they are the least liberalised of all.
You see, Commissioner, when people say that there is a need to strike a balance, I am quite happy to agree, as long as we recognise that, at present, there is no balance at all, that today, in Europe, the so-called liberal professions are in actual fact based on closed professional associations that exercise a collective monopoly defending profit and creating obstacles for young people wanting to enter those professions.
By way of example, let me mention the journalists' association.
Very recently, a well known French journalist with a wealth of professional experience came to Italy when his publishing house bought several Italian newspapers, and he was appointed editor of one of those newspapers.
Italy's journalists' association was up in arms, and made sure that this person, a Frenchman, was unable to do the same job in Italy.
The liberalisation of professional services, as demanded by Italy's antitrust authority, is needed to help make many of Europe's industrial sectors more competitiveÂ âÂ the sectors which are most dependent on the need to have a skills base and to be competitive on international markets.
I welcome the October hearing, as long as, and let me repeat this, it is clear that balance can only be achieved in Europe today if we succeed in weakening the closed shop and monopolistic stranglehold that the professional associations represent.
Â Â  â Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, this debate reminds me a little of the debate we held on so-called services of general interest and competition law.
Although the liberal professions are clearly not a supermarket â and although a supermarket as a market is not a service of general interest in this sense â the two do have some things in common.
In the case of services of general interest, we agreed that competition law, the subsidy rules, and the internal market, meant that there was room for exceptions, to which subsidiarity would apply on the grounds that they can be shown to possess features from and be defined in terms of different identities and cultures.
I think that the basic principle of subsidiarity â looking at different cultures and identities and the historical background of a given situation â can be applied here too.
As supporters of competition law, and not just of Commissioner Monti, we also, though, have to remain consistent.
I therefore feel that the application of EU competition rules to the liberal professions is reasonable and should be supported, provided that the particularities of this sector of the market are taken into account.
I am therefore very pleased to see that the Commission is not questioning the existence of professional organisations.
This, though, brings us to the heart of the matter.
Liberal professions â lawyers, notaries, engineers, architects, doctors and auditors â are very specific in character and have undergone very specific historical development.
They require high levels of qualification and a special relationship of trust with clients.
However, they are also distinguished by the fact that the consumer does not have access to the same information as the service providers themselves.
These characteristics have to be borne in mind.
I therefore think that the Commission cannot be allowed to make the mistake of interpreting professional codes of conduct as a barrier to the freedom of movement of services.
I do however entirely agree with the Commission that self-regulation cannot be used as a shield against the market and should not put consumers at a disadvantage.
Nevertheless, we must not oversimplify matters.
The primary aim of such self-regulation is to guarantee service quality by means of professional ethical standards and to prevent conflicts of interest and misleading advertising.
It is in order to guarantee service quality that professional groups take responsibility for drawing up codes of conduct, and these lay down certain standards to ensure that professionals adhere to the rules and guarantee professional ethics.
I see professional codes of conduct as essential for guaranteeing the impartiality, competence, integrity and responsibility of the members of each professional body and for protecting consumers.
Parliament and my group support the liberal professions because of their high ethical standards, the security they provide for consumers, their competence, impartiality and integrity, and we would ask that this special status be adequately taken into account when considering competition law so as to create security for all.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are two things I must say by way of introduction.
Firstly, I was the rapporteur for Parliament's report on the proposal for a directive referred to by Commissioner Monti.
Secondly, a great deal of alarm has been caused in Europe, and particularly in my own country, by the Commissioner's various initiatives in terms of a series of research studies, of statistical data on charging structures and behavioural methodologies.
Let us talk about the professions then.
I believe that we all need to consider just what the word âprofessionâ means and its impact on the public.
Generally speaking, professionalsÂ âÂ of which there are several million in EuropeÂ âÂ have daily contact with almost everyone in the world.
In some ways, they safeguard safety, health and freedom.
There is a great deal of confusion in general between different types of professionals: intellectual professionals are quite a different kettle of fish from professionals in general.
As regards competitionÂ â and I am afraid that I do not have time to go into the detail I would like in some areasÂ â competition in general means arguing about a price.
When it comes to issues like safety, freedom and health, however, professional services mean having qualifications and levels of education that are certainly out of the ordinary and, in any case, not within everyone's grasp.
Certainly, when we talk about competition we cannot talk in terms of prices but we should talk in terms of quality.
Quality is something altogether different, because it is quality that ensures health, freedom and safety.
This does not mean, as I see it, that we can disregard the question of competition, but we simply need to consider what kind of competition we are talking about.
For example, there is absolutely no way that you can compare two different items of handcraft with two different operations by thoracic surgeons.
By way of conclusion, MrÂ President, I do not believe that one should make sweeping generalisations.
Professional associations are by no means simply closed shops; they have a function as regards training and lifelong learning, which provides consumers with certainty.
Poor, badly functioning legislation that often forces professional associations to act in undesirable ways should not be used as an excuse to abolish the associations themselves.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for this debate, in which I feel a number of very valuable points have been made.
All the speakers have pointed out, with different emphases, that the liberal professions are well-rooted in historyÂ âÂ Mr Gargani spoke eloquently on this subjectÂ âÂ and that we need to strike a balance between sets of contrasting concepts: self-regulation and public regulation; the market and non-market considerations; specificity and, notwithstanding, endeavours to generate greater mobility in Europe.
It has been pointed out, as I said, that we need a balance: this may be where the emphases differ, for someÂ âÂ like Mr Medina Ortega and, to an even greater extent, Mr Della VedovaÂ âÂ believe that the current balance may not be a proper balance and that a great deal more progress needs to be made; others, who are more cautious, call for the specific nature of the liberal professions to be given greater consideration and, therefore, for the current balances to be seen as not so unsatisfactory.
Another thing which appears to have emerged from the debate is that we need to know more, we need to increase our knowledge.
This was precisely the reason for the evaluation exercise, based on the study commissioned by the Commission from the Institute of Higher Studies in Vienna, which I believe adds to our knowledge in that it looks at the current systems in the 15 Member States for five different categories of liberal professions and attempts to make comparisons.
On this basis, indeed, we believe that the hearing, the Conference of 28 October, in which, as has been pointed out by Mr Medina Ortega, in particular, representatives of clients as well as representatives of the professions will take part, may be useful.
In this regard, we must not forget that the clients of the professions are made up of both private individuals and companies: the impact of quality, of course, of standards of conduct and also of prices is therefore significant in terms of the real level of income, the citizensâ standard of living and the production costs of companies.
The situations in the Member States differ, as has emerged from this study.
In this regard, Mr Karas, I feel that the comparison you made between this issue of the liberal professions and the matter of services of general economic interestÂ âÂ , to put it more succinctlyâis extremely interesting.
Indeed, in both cases, we have to recognise demands that go beyond purely market considerations and, in both cases, I believe there is room, with due regard for those demands, for attempting to increase competition and efficiency.
I feel that the Commission is taking a very balanced approach to this task.
I note, as you did, Mr ZappalÃ , that some alarm has arisen in a number of Member States.
I would like, if I may, to take this opportunity to stress that such alarm is unfounded, for two reasons: firstly becauseÂ âÂ to use your expressionÂ âÂ nobody is trying to lump everyone together; on the contrary, the study on which our evaluation exercise is based distinguishes, as I said, between five professional categories and 15 Member States, precisely in order to avoid lumping everyone together under the same umbrella.
In a preliminary press debate in a number of Member States, the European Commission was said to be intending to opt for uncontrolled liberalisation.
Irrespective of the fact that the Commission has a tradition of a certain prudence in its initiatives, we believe that, particularly in this field, it would be rather silly to start from the assumption that there is nothing that needs changing, although none of us sees uncontrolled liberalisation as an option.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.(1)
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council in Brussels on 16 and 17 October 2003.
I should like to say to Mr Antonione that we appreciate the enormous pressures that he has been operating under today.
When we are given ambitious schedules, they are sometimes very difficult to keep to, even with the best will and the highest levels of flexibility.
I would, however, make a general appeal to Mr Antonione and I would ask him to pass this appeal on to his colleagues to give the appropriate priority to the interinstitutional relationship with this House.
I would ask that we use our best endeavours to avoid repetitions of what is an unfortunate but in the case of this afternoon unavoidable problem.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, before I start, I really do want to apologise for the delay: I was detained by duties I had to carry out on behalf of the Italian Presidency, as a result of which I arrived later than the time scheduled for the debate on the agenda.
I would also like to thank you, Mr President, and the other Members of Parliament, and the Commission too, for changing the order of business and thus giving me the chance to speak now.
I can assure you, Mr President, that I will do everything in my power to avoid this happening again.
We will certainly give absolute priority to the relationship between the institutions, as it is right to do.
I am grateful to the European Parliament for this opportunity to present to the House the main topics on the agenda for the forthcoming European Council, which will take place here in Brussels on 16 and 17 October.
On the morning of 16 October, before the European Council opens, the Intergovernmental Conference will hold its second meeting, at the level of Heads of State or Government, assisted by their Foreign Ministers.
The proceedings of the European Council itself will start at 4Â p.m. with the customary meeting between the Heads of State or Government and the President of the European Parliament.
Before I present to you the items on the agenda for the forthcoming European Council, I would like to say a few words about the special summit of Heads of State or Government which, as you know, took place in Rome earlier this month to mark the official opening of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.
We have thus now embarked on the second leg of the constitutional process that began with the work of the Convention and the draft Constitutional Treaty which it drew up.
President Cox, let me begin by mentioning your own attendance at the inaugural session, something to which, as you well know, the Italian Presidency attached particular importance.
Your fellow Members, Mr HÃ€nsch and Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, went on to attend the first ministerial meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was held in the afternoon of the same day.
The Rome summit basically confirmed our shared understanding of the historic nature of this stage in the process of European integration and the need to provide the enlarged Union with cohesive, mutually agreed constitutional foundations; that, we are convinced, is essential if we are to strengthen Europe's internal cohesion and increase the credibility and authority of its international role.
The atmosphere of the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was attended by the President and Vice-Presidents of the Commission and, as I mentioned earlier, the President of the European Parliament, in addition to the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, the acceding States and the candidate countries, was constructive.
There was broad consensus on the fact that the Member States were collectively accountable to Europe's public opinion for ensuring the success of the IGC in the interests of the enlarged Union and of its Member States.
The very fact that the Heads of State or Government adopted the Rome Declaration without difficulty is clear confirmation that the adoption of a draft Constitutional Treaty is a shared goal and a vital step for Europe.
There were, of course, persisting national differences on specific aspects of the draft Treaty, although the collective intention to adhere to the timeframes we established at Thessaloniki was confirmed.
The first ministerial meeting of the IGC resulted in further clarification of the timetable, methodology and organisation of the work which the Italian Presidency intends to carry out in order to provide the Heads of State or Government with all the elements necessary for them to reach a comprehensive agreement at their meeting on 12 and 13 December 2003.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming European Council in Brussels will focus primarily on reviving the economy and increasing competitiveness and on certain aspects of European asylum and immigration policy, in particular the issue of the joint management of the Union's external borders and controlling migration flows.
The General Affairs Council held an initial discussion on the draft annotated agenda at its meeting on 29Â September 2003 and will return to the subject at its next meeting, on 13 October, on the basis of an updated version of the agenda, which will also reflect the conclusions of the meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs and Ecofin Councils earlier this month and the meeting of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council on 9 October.
As is customary at summits, the Brussels European Council will also deal with topical international issues.
The agenda is still being finalised but I can tell you that, as things stand, the Summit will address the issue of the situation in the Middle East, following the recent, extremely disturbing developments, the situation in Iraq, with a view, not least, to the impending Donorsâ Conference, and the situation in Iran, in the context of our endeavour to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
As I have already mentioned, the Italian Presidency intends discussions at the forthcoming European Council meeting to centre on the urgent need to revive the European economy.
Let me say straight away, however, that the Italian Presidency does not intend there to be any overlap with the spring European Council.
Indeed, in March 2004, as scheduled, we will have our yearly appointment to review the overall implementation of the Lisbon strategy on the basis of the Commissionâs report and contributions from the various Council configurations.
Nonetheless, the Italian Presidency does consider that the forthcoming mid-October European Council will afford a useful opportunity for an exchange of views and a policy debate on a highly topical and urgent issue which is a source of concern to us all and on which our opinions converge.
In other words, we expect the October summit to provide scope for a debate on economic growth and revival and on the instruments for increasing competitiveness in an economic climate in which Europe's economy is still struggling to seize the opportunities for recovery which are visible in other parts of the world.
We also expect the European Council conclusions to provide pointers and commitments to guide the work of the various Council configurations in the months ahead.
Indeed, we are convinced of the need to continue with sound macroeconomic policies while, at the same time, speeding up the necessary structural reforms, promoting investment in infrastructure and human capital and adopting economic policies oriented towards growth, job creation and genuine integration of the new Member States into the great single market.
The European Council should lay the foundations for a programme supporting growth based on significantly increased investment in major infrastructure networks and in research and development projects, with more substantial private-sector input.
We welcome the recent Commission communication and the Ecofin Council decisions on the European Initiative for Growth.
We call upon the European Council to give the economy a further decisive boost.
Developing the trans-European transport network projects and ensuring that they actually get under way is a matter of particular urgency, not only as a response to enlargement and in the interests of integration between the old and the new Member States, but also in order to remove the obstacles and bottlenecks currently distorting the operation of the internal market.
Against this backdrop, the forthcoming European Council is to give its assessment of the Commission's proposed new plan for priority TEN projects and should be able to give a clear, powerful recommendation for the proposals to be swiftly approved.
Indeed, we believe that it is essential to set a reliable timetable for implementing the projects in order to stimulate investment-based economic growth and to boost market expectations and business confidence.
Italy's recent electricity black-out has made us all more aware of the pressing need to complete the creation of a truly integrated European energy market and to strengthen the security of energy supplies, bearing in mind the Member States' heavy dependence on imported energy as well.
The European Council will thus need to provide guidance, not least, on better integrating European networks and developing new forms of energy cooperation with third countries, in particular with the Mediterranean partners, with a view to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Energy Ministers in Rome in early December.
Enhancing competitiveness remains the key to achieving the objectives of growth and job creation.
The Italian Presidency understands the need to use the right instruments, both at European and at national level, for organising a genuinely open, competitive market based on knowledge, industrial development and a steadily expanding and diversifying services sector.
Investment in research, advanced technologies and human capital is vital if we are to achieve our growth objectives.
The European Council will be called upon to provide the necessary impetus, stimulating Member States to adopt coordinated measures to ensure tangible progress towards the target investment of 3% of GDP in research and urging industry and all parties concerned to contribute to creating European technological platforms in key competitive sectors of the Union's economy.
Lastly, the European Council will also address the social dimension in its work and the vital role played by social protection systems in enhancing the competitiveness of Europe's economies.
However, social protection systems across Europe are now having to respond to the challenge of an ageing population, so, while it will be necessary, on the one hand, to ensure that the social dimension is strengthened and fully integrated into the Union's economic and employment policies, on the other, it is just as essential to devise policies for reforming the employment market and to address the issue of Europe's steadily ageing population by reforming benefit and pension systems to make them financially sustainable while, at the same time, maintaining a high level of social protection.
In a nutshell, then, at the forthcoming meeting of the European Council, the Presidency will confirm that the timing of the launch of the growth initiative is intended to give a strong signal of sound economic governance and renewed confidence in Europe's economic potential.
Given current economic pressures, that signal now needs to ring out loud and clear if we are to sustain the gathering pace of structural reform under the Lisbon agenda.
Before I close, I would add thatÂ âÂ as I started out by sayingÂ âÂ the Presidency considers that the European Council may also note some recent developments in respect of the Thessaloniki European Council guidelines on asylum and immigration policies and, more importantly, that it may pave the way for new joint initiatives at European level.
The forthcoming European summit will, therefore, be called upon to confirm that controlling migration flows is a top priority and to reaffirm the Union's commitment to promoting a balance between the proper management of legal immigration and renewed efforts to combat illegal immigration.
We therefore expect the European Council to call on the Commission, the Council and all Member States to do everything in their power to facilitate and speed up the conclusion of readmission agreements, in particular with the countries of origin or transit of large migration flows while, at the same time, confirming the importance of effective Community action on repatriation, in order to give credibility to Europe's policy on combating illegal immigration.
With the imminent enlargement of the Union and the need to make every effort to increase the security of Europe's citizens, the Heads of State or Government will, once again, need to stress that all Member StatesÂ âÂ old and newÂ âÂ have a common interest in seeing effective mechanisms put in place for the joint management of the Union's borders, particularly its sea borders.
The importance of fully implementing the plan for the management of the Union's external borders should therefore be confirmed afresh and the Commission invited to submit at the earliest opportunity a proposal for setting up a border management agency.
Lastly, the European Council will call on the Council to complete its work on the proposal for a directive on asylum as soon as possible and will welcome the study launched by the Commission on setting national quotas, with the present and future Member States being urged to cooperate fully with the Commission to that end.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Antonione, ladies and gentlemen, on 16 and 17 October, the European Council is going to address the questions of strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice and reviving our economy.
Today, I would like to focus on these two key areas.
Immigration stopped being a purely national question some time ago.
It was transformed dramatically into a European question as the ever-increasing flows of immigrants and the increase in related crime set the alarm bells ringing in all the Member States.
The management of our borders must therefore become a shared task that we tackle together in the interests of us all.
The impending enlargement will extend the Unionâs external borders and the new MemberÂ States will become almost entirely responsible for them.
Alone, the new countries are in no position to manage this onerous task, which involves not just policing but alsoÂ âÂ and perhaps above allÂ âÂ political and social planning.
Our human social conscience tells us that unlawful trafficking in human beings and hopeful voyages undertaken under inhumane conditions cannot be tolerated.
At the same time, we must address the question of migration flows resolutely and coordinate the management of our common borders.
The Thessaloniki European Council showed the way, stressing the need to step up implementation of the Tampere programme, particularly with regard to a common European policy on asylum and migration.
At the next Council, the Commission will fulfil the mandate assigned to it by the European Council by presenting a series of measures with a view to completing the common policy.
As an initial move, the idea of setting up an agency for the management and operational coordination of border controls is currently being explored and the Council will be able to take a decision on this by the end of the year.
The agency will not replace national border guards.
Its tasks will involve organising horizontal operations such as risk analysis, training, research and the procurement of equipment to be loaned to Member States.
A special study has been carried out on sea borders with a view to incorporating them in the overall organisation of the Unionâs external borders.
The Commission will also propose introducing biometric identification methods for visas and residence permits that will later be incorporated into the major computer systems, most notably the second generation of the Schengen Information System.
We are also preparing initiatives aimed at making passports more secure.
When tackling this extremely sensitive issue, however, we will always bear in mind that the need for security and controls must not jeopardise our citizensâ right to privacy.
The most pressing issue is undoubtedly the question of migration flows.
Legal immigrants are actually an economic, cultural and human resource that we must welcome and integrate into our societies as best we can, with due regard for their dignity.
A pro-active policy on economic immigration and integration therefore needs to take account of the situation in the immigrantsâ country of provenance, our economic and social needs and our effective capacity to integrate the new arrivals.
It is also our duty to combat illegal immigration, however.
In the coming months we will need to focus on two instruments: readmission agreements and return policies.
As requested by the Council, the Commission has opened negotiations with third countries to establish readmission procedures for citizens who have entered the European Union unlawfully.
Although great efforts have been made, these are difficult negotiations because the Commission has to persuade third countries not only to readmit their own citizens but also to allow citizens on their way back to other states to pass through those countries.
Our experience shows that the negotiations will be successful only if they are conducted within a broader framework and we can bring to the table a number of incentives.
For example, in the Authorised Destination Status agreement we concluded only last week with China, which includes a readmission clause, economic considerations played a significant role.
Some might say that they should not have done, but that is the way things are.
The other important point is the need to offer our partner countries guaranteed immigration quotas, preferably within the context of negotiations involving economic cooperation, development aid and access to markets.
Indeed, it is essential that the Member States facilitate our negotiating position so that we can reach fair agreements that help to create the necessary climate of cooperation and trust with the partner countries.
All the various stages of any return policy must be adequately financed.
To ensure that operations are efficient and are conducted with full respect for the dignity of the persons concerned, in autumn the Commission will propose creating a special financial instrument to fund returns over the period from 2004 to 2006.
On the basis of this experience, we will be in a position to include a genuine European Fund for Repatriation in the new Financial Perspective that will enter into force in 2007.
Today, we find ourselves having to contend with migration flows in which it is difficult to distinguish between refugees in search of asylum and economic migrants: the two are very often confused.
We must therefore offer protection to those in need while, at the same time, regulating access for the others in an organised manner.
First and foremost, however, we need to strengthen the institution of asylum, which is an integral part of our humanitarian tradition but which seems to be coming under heavy fire from public opinion in many countries.
To implement the Thessaloniki European Councilâs conclusions by the end of the year, the Commission will complete the first phase of the development of the common asylum system agreed at Tampere by adopting the two directives not yet in place: one on procedures and oneÂ âÂ a complex but important documentÂ âÂ on the definition of refugee.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn briefly to the other major subject that will be addressed by the Brussels Council: how to help revive Europeâs economy.
Needless to say, the last two years have not produced encouraging signs from our economy.
The current picture is of weak growth, little confidence on the part of households and businesses and low levels of investment.
However, a few recent indicators suggest that the corner may about to be turnedÂ âÂ let us hope soÂ âÂ and that the current slump may, at last, be in sight, barring tensions in international politics.
The underlying economic conditions (the fundamentals) are good because the MemberÂ States have stuck to the rules and behaved in less divergent ways, particularly following the introduction of the euro, and thanks to an increased awareness of the need to implement the structural reforms agreed in Lisbon.
We must therefore give our economy fresh impetus.
To this end, last week, the Commission adopted the European Initiative for Growth, which will now be put before the Council for approval.
The Initiative is, of course, based on the Lisbon strategy on investment in networks and knowledge.
However, its objective is to mobilise additional public and, above all, new private fundsin the shorter term to finance European-scale infrastructure projects and boost research and innovation.
The message to our citizens is, therefore, that we are laying the practical foundations for structural, long-term improvements to our competitiveness.
A European transport and communications network is essential to better integrate our economies and to increase cohesion.
By demonstrating our determination, we will send out a clear signal that the Union is, at last, able to take economic decisions that can no longer be put off.
The new market opportunities guaranteed by the financial commitment of the MemberÂ States and the private sector will, in turn, encourage direct input from European businesses.
The direct effects of the investments in the projects will be seen as soon as work is started on the construction sites, which, in a large number of cases, could be quite soon.
The Initiative we are presenting to you today has benefited from experience gained from previous initiatives and attempts to resolve problems that have caused delays in the past.
As part of the strategy, last week, the Commission adopted a package that includes 29 major trans-European network projects involving a total investment of some EUR 220 billion between now and 2020.
This is the overall picture of what must be achieved if we are to provide the single market with an effective infrastructure to make our economy more competitive.
However, it is clear that only certain projects will be ready for implementation in the near future.
The Commission will give the European Council an indication of the timetable for completing the works listed to enable the Heads of State or Government to concentrate all their efforts and make the greatest possible contribution to boosting the economy in the short term.
While the Initiative looks for greater private sector investment, there is clearly still a key role for public financing.
This makes the balance and, above all, the quality of public expenditure absolutely crucial.
We must direct investment towards growth.
To increase leverage and thus speed up the completion of the works, we propose increasing the contribution from the Community budget from 10% to 30% for the cross-border aspects of the highest priority projects.
This will make it possible to mobilise far greater private sector resources.
We also need to give the European Investment Bank a greater role, however.
To this end, the Initiative proposes to give it a greater role in easing the burden and sharing the financial risks.
We will also urge the Member States to step up their investment in research, development and knowledge to encourage the development of physical and human capital.
These are the only recipes for safeguarding sustainable employment in the long term.
I cannot repeat enoughÂ âÂ picking up on what MrÂ Antonione said about the inadequate level of researchÂ âÂ that supremacy in international competition is to be achieved through innovation, centres of excellence and the development and transmission of information and knowledge.
We also need to do more in terms of lifelong learning and training for our citizens.
In addition to the great efforts they are making in the field of structural reform, the Member States will also, therefore, need to step up their work in these areas, taking advantage of Community resources such as the Sixth Framework Programme, the performance reserve and the mid-term review of the Structural Funds in 2004.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must link up the major European research centres, support their activities and make them attractive to academics and scientists throughout the world.
There is nothing for it: we must take the decision to provide Europe with the best centres of excellence in the world, for, otherwise, our children will lose enthusiasm for research and innovation.
We must concentrate on technical and scientific innovation and on ways of helping manufacturers turn innovation into new processes and products.
These are the playing fields on which we will win or lose our future prosperity, our influence on the international stage and our capacity to defend Europeâs interests and uphold its values in the world.
Therefore, we must find the political will to meet this challenge and press forward resolutely towards the goal which I know you, too, are striving to achieve.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is starting much later than planned, and I would like to apologise because as soon as I finish speaking I will leave to attend another important engagement.
This is something I have never done before.
I know we all have other commitments, and I was engaged to be elsewhere at 5Â p.m.
I hope that there will be no repetition of todayâs delays.
The summit of Heads of State or Government in the spring of 2002 did expressly set itself a very ambitious objective, namely to create the most competitive economy in the world.
This claim always reminds me of Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s and 1960s, when the Soviet Union wanted to outdo the US.
We know how that ended.
Slightly more moderate language would make our present situation â namely the lack of progress â a little easier.
At the same time, we have to ensure that Europeâs economy becomes more competitive.
In order for that to happen, two key conditions must first be met.
One is the reform of our social system, and the other is greater flexibility in labour markets.
Happily, people are living longer, but this also presents a massive challenge to our social system.
Our group feels very strongly that we have to introduce more independence and self-sufficiency into our social systems.
We need to make the labour market more flexible, because if the labour market stays as it is, if we maintain the , people out of work will be hit particularly hard, and these are the very people we want to see return to work.
Our group would therefore like to encourage governments which are undertaking a tough reform process to address this issue to keep going, in order to provide us with answers for the future that offer genuine, viable solutions for todayâs younger generation.
The best policy approach for jobs, companies, and particularly for medium-sized companies, is a moderate taxation policy.
The less taxes companies have to pay, the more they will be willing to invest in Europe.
Today, we know that it is because our current economic system is so bureaucratic and often has very high taxation, that our companies invest outside the European Union.
We can therefore only encourage policies which offer the best for medium-sized companies, with maximum transparency in taxation, to show that investment within the European Union is worthwhile, rather than forcing companies, as is increasingly the case, to invest outside the European Union.
My colleague Mr Karas, our economic policy coordinator, whom I see here, spoke, about Basel II a few weeks ago.
We also have to ensure that Basel II does not make it harder for medium-sized companies to invest.
Instead we need to conclude worldwide agreements and organise Basel II in such a way that it is possible for medium-sized companies to take out loans and pay them back under reasonable conditions.
Then there is the question of European bureaucracy and the self-inflicted tangles of red tape.
Here I am addressing the President of the Commission.
We are eagerly awaiting the Commission proposals for chemicals legislation.
But if this legislation on chemicals results in European companies again investing outside the European Union because of the thousands of regulations imposed upon them and leaving the European market, then it will lead to further job losses and consequently a less competitive Europe.
We would therefore caution against tying the European economy up in more red tape through national or European legislation.
Let me comment briefly on the question of the stability of the euro.
There are some people who believe we now ought to go well beyond the 3% figure established under Maastricht for new borrowings.
I can only advise against such a step.
If we enter into new borrowings now, those loans will have to be repaid, and the money used to make the repayments will then not be available for investment.
It is investment that creates jobs.
For this reason the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats recognises the need to uphold the stability criteria, although obviously we do acknowledge the difficulties that national governments are facing.
The President of the Commission and, I believe, the President-in-Office of the Council, have talked about how important it is to do something for education and research.
We cannot continue to allow ever more young scientists to go to the United States and thus be lost to us.
This represents a loss not only of human potential, but also of the future potential of Europe.
The issue must therefore be addressed more directly.
To close, I would like to make a couple of brief remarks about Europeâs borders and the protection of them.
It is a very important topic, but I wonder whether it is necessary to create a new border management agency, as set out in the European Council paper.
Can we not tackle the problems using existing structures?
I am just airing the question now.
Let me also encourage the Presidency not to limit discussions at the conference on the Mediterranean dialogue in December to the very important question of borders.
Rather, I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to also consider how we can help countries to help themselves, particularly those Mediterranean countries which are not members of the European Union, in order to prevent people climbing into boats in order to reach the borders of the European Union, resulting in the tragedies that we keep seeing in the Mediterranean.
My last words are a request to the President-in-Office of the Council, and one I think he will follow up.
I would like to encourage the President-in-Office to do his utmost to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference comes to agreement by the end of the year.
Please do not allow every page of the Conventionâs proposals to be completely renegotiated.
Concentrate on the three or four key points.
We will support you in your efforts to achieve a result, because we need a European constitution.
A European constitution is the basis on which this European Union, which will soon comprise twenty-five Member States and 450 million people, will be able to make the decisions it needs to make, will be able to act, to be democratic, and to uphold parliamentary principles.
So let me encourage you to concentrate your efforts during the presidency on the constitution.
It is the top priority for these six months.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that the first part of your speech fulfils the commitment given by the Italian Presidency to inform Parliament of what has happened during each part-session.
I would like to say that those of us, myself in particular, who asked that Parliament be adequately represented, appear to have been listened to and I would like to thank the Italian Presidency for this.
With regard to the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference, I must say to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council â and you will understand this given your professional experience â that you have touched our trigeminus, which is the most sensitive nerve in the body, as you are well aware.
Why?
Because the first thing the Intergovernmental Conference has done has been to get rid of the legislative Council, with some resistance on the part of Germany and Portugal, and that is very serious.
It is very serious because we are working on the basis of shared legislative powers and the first thing the Council does is to dismantle something which is essential in a democracy: legislating in the open, in public.
It appears to be an appendix to the Council and I naturally support our two representatives in the Intergovernmental Conference who vigorously opposed that outrage.
Furthermore, I would say that this is not only a problem you face with us: it is also a problem you face as regards the national parliaments, because the greatest insult is to the parliaments of the Member States.
I would repeat my request that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs invite all the members of the Convention from the national parliaments and present them with this problem: how can the legislative Council be dismantled in the first session of the Intergovernmental Conference.
And having said that, please allow me to focus on my observations relating to the economic aspect.
I will leave the task of dealing with the issue of borders to my colleague, Mrs Ana TerrÃ³n.
My comments are based on one particular fact: stability is a public asset; nobody, neither people, families nor States can live beyond their means, and the policy of stability based on combating inflation is a policy in defence of the majority of society.
Only property owners, and the bigger the better, can survive and even profit from inflation.
Stability protects the most humble and the Stability Pact is an urgent objective, but there can be no stability without growth.
At the moment the greatest danger to the European economy is not so much inflation but deflation and therefore, having lived through three years of mild recession, all the Member States must address a situation in which there are fewer resources, and they are therefore in a vicious cycle in which they have to increasingly get into debt or reduce investment costs and sometimes both things at the same time.
It appears that Europe has chosen the latter route, which is the worst one.
Since the end of the last decade public investments have fallen in the European Union by around 1% (in the United States this figure stands at 3%).
According to the Commissionâs data, investment of 1% means supplementary growth of 0.6%.
We must recognise that the European States have not taken advantage of the good years.
They have not carried out a policy of the ant: they have carried out a policy of the cicada and have not reduced their debt, but it is equally true that the Member States will not recover the virtuous cycle of growth if they restrict themselves to survival or maintenance investments, and if they continue to cut off the citizensâ spending power.
What we must do is carry out an intelligent reform of the pact in order not to be guilty of the accusation of stupidity which has been made.
Yes, Mr President, I will use the same expression; you will know that it is the only one that does not require translation into any European language: stupidity.
We must be more rigorous in periods of strong growth: for example, the obligation to have a balanced budget on the basis of 3% growth or more, the obligation to use anything that exceeds the 3% growth in order to decrease debt and to leave the States in the euro zone with more flexibility for investment spending during a recession phase.
What does not make any sense is to maintain a single level which does not correspond to the Unionâs economic reality.
Specifically, at the moment Germany and France, with a debt of around 60% of their GDP, have greater room for manoeuvre than Italy or Belgium which exceed it, which exceed 100% by a long way.
In other words, we must be flexible here as well.
And if we were capable of attaching new conditions â something which should be debated at the European Council â to the Stability and Growth Pact, then the second part we have all referred to would come: this formula of returning to a great network of investments in trans-European networks also supplemented by investments in technology and research.
This was said ten years ago at the European Council in Essen.
With enlargement our EURÂ 400Â billion are going to become the EURÂ 600Â billion identified by the Van Miert group with a view to 2020.
Well, nothing is being done.
We are moving very slowly.
An analysis is made and what can be done?
The President of the Commission has proposed â if I have understood correctly â that funding should increase from 10% to 30% of the projects.
This is a step.
What can the other be?
It may be a great European loan.
Why not?
Our capacity for debt is intact, we have a euro zone in which 90% of transactions are carried out between the member countries.
Why do we not dare to implement a relaunching policy, which no country can do individually, so that there may be results for the whole continent?
Our budget approximately represents a miserly 1% of Community GDP.
The United States deficit for this financial year is equivalent to 6 European Union budgets.
I do not propose that we go as far as the United States with the deficit spending, but we could at least make an effort.
We have the means but we do not have the will.
Â Â  Mr President, as we approach the first European Council of the Italian presidency and assess the progress thus far, is the glass of prosecco that the presidency will offer next week half full or half empty?
On the evidence of the inaugural meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference in Rome I fear it is half empty.
When the Member States convene again to discuss Europe's draft constitution, they should recall the shambolic Nice Summit and reflect on the costs of failure.
Poland and Spain should be reminded that their intransigence over the reform of voting weights in Council is perilous politics as well as poor mathematics.
If the Nice arrangements were satisfactory, the Council would not have established a Convention in the first place.
The system of majority voting agreed at Nice is unwieldy and unfair.
To its credit, the Convention threw out the unsteady compromises of Nice and proposed a voting system which is fairer and more transparent.
Last time I checked, the representatives of the Spanish and Polish Governments had signed up to the Convention's outcome: now they must respect its work.
On other issues too, the hard bargaining has been done.
The consensus crafted by the Convention will not be improved on in Rome.
Unpick the substance of the draft Treaty and the IGC will drag on into 2004 and descend into diplomatic farce.
Then Rome really will be the eternal city.
When it comes to economic reform and the Stability Pact, the bubbles in the prosecco have long evaporated.
France has yet to convince us that it takes its responsibilities seriously.
While we understand the reluctance of some governments to confront France, a Stability Pact without teeth is a paper dragon breathing tinsel flames.
The eight governments which have worked hard to play by the rules - often at considerable political cost - have every right to be dismayed that their larger neighbours take fiscal laxity so lightly.
The Italian presidency's drive to enhance Europe's competitiveness at the European Council is welcome. But we need to move beyond bold declarations.
To achieve better and simpler legislation we need proper consultation and business impact assessments.
A level playing field for company take-overs is still frustratingly far away and we have much work to do to agree a viable framework for an integrated market in investment services before the European elections.
My group welcomes this week's decision by finance ministers to refocus the growth initiative away from road and rail projects and towards investment in innovation which will help to close Europe's research deficit.
In the field of Justice and Home Affairs, there is more sparkle in the Council's agenda.
The balance which the Liberal Group seeks to ensure between tackling illegal migration and providing for a system of managed legal migration seems to be essentially there.
We will support the Commission in its efforts to create a Border Management Agency.
Europe's new eastern border will be one of the longest in the world: it is crucial that we pool our expertise in policing it properly.
Sadly, the external agenda of the Union leaves us no cause for celebration.
The failure of CancÃºn must redouble our determination to secure reform of the WTO and trading arrangements which help the world's poorest countries.
Europe must insist on a central role for the United Nations in return for the internationalisation of the situation in Iraq.
And the tragic events of the past week in the Middle East confirm the need for Europe and America to remain engaged.
My group condemns unreservedly the suicide bombings in Haifa, but calls on Israel to abide by international law and act proportionately in its response.
A new Constitution, a credible Stability Pact, a revitalised economy, a secure and just Europe in a more stable world: these would be the flavours of a truly vintage year: .
I too must apologise to Council and Commission for having to leave before the end of this debate.
The rescheduling of this debate has caused me this embarrassment.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the European Council will take place at a time when Germany, Italy and Portugal are going through a recession and when France is poised to follow them.
In addition to these countries, the entire euro zone is experiencing an economic downturn and, in many ways, a downturn in social protection too.
There is now such a wide gulf between the supposed benefits of the completion of the internal market and the introduction of the euro and the everyday realities of our fellow citizens that we are entitled to call for a genuine public and pluralist evaluation of the guidelines that have been followed and of the instruments with which the Union has implemented these guidelines.
It goes without saying that the course of action I have recommended bears no relation at all to the anti-European demagoguery of some senior political leaders â starting with those of my own country, MrÂ Watson â who use such talk to cover themselves in the eyes of their electors.
These leaders accuse Brussels in order to make people forget that their own Head of State personally negotiated the Treaties and signed the Stability Pact.
They only complain about the harshness of the procedures in force when they themselves are faced with a powerful and entirely legitimate resistance movement made up of workers in their own countries.
Above all, they do not call into question the very mindset of the stability pact and even less that of the Phare institution whose pact is ultimately just its bodyguard: the European Central Bank.
Its mandate and its statutes make those of the Central Bank appear to be the most liberal and untouchable in the world.
This is precisely why I believe the evaluation that I have just mentioned to be so necessary.
It is true that when economies are so interdependent, there must be common rules and these must be observed.
What rules, though, and to achieve what objectives?
This is the crux of the matter.
What have we gained from this approach of attracting capital in rivalry with the United States, at the cost of a permanent and almost obsessive quest to bring wage costs down and to check social spending?
What have we gained from this cult of price stability, at a time when our economies are suffering, not as a result of inflation but of deflation?
Do you realise what each of these fine steps forward praised by Commissioner Solbes mean for peopleâs lives?
In France, today, they are nothing more than a good mark, given for freezing public spending until 2007 and even reducing it â and this covers the budgets for young people, education, work, accommodation, transport, research â and for halving current health spending.
This is an unacceptable prospect for the French people, and for the citizens of Germany, Italy, Portugal or anywhere else and I believe it is frankly irresponsible to have forced the future Member States beforehand to undergo shock therapy â which actually consists of shocks without any therapy â in the name of an or accepted body of Community legislation which, incidentally, is by no means accepted by millions of Europeans.
It is true that there is a deep need for social transformation and, therefore, for change in European policies.
It would be marvellous if the European Council did not create a deadlock over this clear state of crisis and instead gave us its diagnosis and solutions, followed by a real debate with our fellow citizens.
One alternative approach is for us to address monetary policy and hence the role and workings of the European Central Bank.
The priority of monetary policy and of the ECB must, we believe, be to promote human capacities and consequently, first of all, making employment and training more secure for everyone.
Their task would then be to make our countries much less dependent on the financial markets.
Politics must control the market and not the other way around.
Consequently, the idea of a selective credit policy, which would be extremely favourable to the investments that support our new political priorities but a real deterrent to those who do not support them, would come up against a genuine confrontation of opinions.
This, in any event, is the type of debate that needs to be held to enable Europeâs citizens to state their feelings about the draft Constitution in full knowledge of the facts.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, quite a few of my colleagues have already drawn attention to the precarious economic situation and have also asked for structural remedies to be put in place.
Nevertheless, we are being bombarded with conflicting reports on a daily basis.
Here in Belgium, people have been hit hard by the report, this week, that 3Â 000 workers in Ford Genk are to lose their jobs.
The fact that a reduction in the sales of a specific car model can have such an impact, that heavy and promised investments were withdrawn and that all this employment disappears in one fell swoop, can also have major implications for the rest of Europe.
Today, the lead article of an important newspaper was entitled: âIs Ford set to disappear across Europe?â
I do not want to dwell on this any further, but I would still like to ask you to come up with realistic solutions that no longer create the impression that employment is something that capitalists can play about with.
People now have the impression that they are being put upon.
A second concern which you expressed is that for peace.
You know that our great concern with regard to the Middle East is growing by the day.
Since the war in Iraq, peace has not been established.
