That is something I am able to say, even though I am a member of the opposition in my country.
As I see it, it is a necessary and obvious step for Sweden to become fully a part of European integration in its entirety and to have the euro as its currency and coinage.
Now, it is the Swedish population that will decide this on 14 September.
The 'wait and see' approach championed by some of my fellow MEPs in Parliament richly deserves to be criticised.
What would have become of European integration if Robert Schuman's natural inclination had been to hesitate, or if, when the Berlin Wall was torn down, Helmut Kohl had been governed by short-term economic interests, or if Jacques Delors' distinguishing characteristic had been anxiety?
Nothing at all would have become of it.
It is my hope and my conviction that, on 15 September, I shall be able, with my head held high, to come back to you, Mr President, and to you, Commissioner, with the message: 'It was a ?yes?' vote.
The Swedish people want to be fully involved and to exert influence over both the new and the old Europe'.
In conclusion, I want to say that there is a certain confusion where the amendments are concerned.
I nonetheless want to say, however, that I hope to be able to achieve as large and as broad a majority as possible.
I have listened to the criticism and am able to accept that Amendments Nos 12 and 14 should be removed because their subjects are covered elsewhere.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen and most particularly, Commissioner Solbes Mira, the presentation of the Commission document on Public Finances to which my report is dedicated shared at the time the firmly-held conviction that the economic forecasts for the European area should then be systematically revised downwards.
The economic context of budgetary surveillance has indeed proven to be much less favourable than initially predicted and is demonstrated, specifically, by the doubling of the Eurozone's deficit between the years 2000 and 2001, by the 'fact' that this imbalance grew and became more serious in 2002 and by the explanation and real scrutiny of the serious budgetary difficulties that have occurred in four of the Member States.
For this very reason, the Commission drew up recommendations and stated its intention to send early warnings about deviating from the budget to Member States that could potentially fail to comply.
Although this was not carried out, it ultimately anticipated the true situation seen at the end of the year in those countries.
The tone of the speech President Romano Prodi gave this Parliament is therefore fully justified.
In this speech he expressed his concern at the downturn in the economic cycle, but also emphatically criticised an inflexible and dogmatic enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact regardless of changing circumstances and consequently called for adjustments and the introduction of more sophisticated criteria for implementing the Pact.
Since then, many politicians, experts, research bodies, academics and leaders of public and published opinion have contributed their thoughts on the matter.
The Commission itself has stuck to the prudent but ambitious interpretation of its President, redrafting a less rigid and more active framework of budgetary supervision that now adheres to the principle that the Pact's implementation must make it an ever more valuable instrument in promoting stability, growth and employment.
The report endorses this viewpoint to the extent that it considers this to correspond to an intermediate stage between the rigid application of the Pact and the crucial development towards an interpretative model, which it considers to be inevitable in future, taking account of more sophisticated criteria such as inflation, employment, public debts and changes in these debts, financial burdens arising from the ageing of the population and investment requirements.
Finally, the quality of public expenditure must serve to bring the SGP into line with the objectives laid down in the Lisbon strategy and with the principle of sustainable development as agreed in Gothenburg.
The political prevalence of budgetary constraints and a rigid interpretation of the financial balance under multilateral surveillance have led in recent years to a steady decline in the ratio of public investment to GDP, although it must be acknowledged that private investment has followed the same trend.
All of this coincides with the increased difficulties that the European economy has been displaying.
The solutions proposed initially or which are now being adopted are not unheard of in the context of some developed economies in the OECD where the 'golden rule' is a crucial element, not only for consolidating public finances, but also for launching and sustaining a process of economic and social development.
Following the enormous step that was the creation of the single currency, the Union appears today to be in a genuine state of paralysis.
The excessive restrictions on monetary and budgetary policies, which were designed with the intention of strengthening the European economy and its single currency and to allay the suspicions and fears of the Union's most powerful countries, could turn into unexpected limitations that will make the sought-after recovery entirely dependent on the smooth operation of the driving force that is the US economy.
The flexibility and rationality that are being advocated are not incompatible with the need to ensure compliance with the real spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact, and nor does a public debate on the matter diminish the scope of its objectives.
The financial consolidation of the States that accept a common monetary policy and a single currency and which reject any self-sufficiency that hinders open relations with countries outside their own zone is crucial and must be pursued.
Many countries, incidentally, have enshrined principles and rules in their Constitutions establishing rules - some more rigid, some less so - for budgetary deficits.
This is also crucial in the political framework of the Union, but if this type of commitment is to be effective, priority consideration must be given to the interests of the zone as a whole - a very substantial area - with the use of discretionary instruments being acceptable in exceptional circumstances to aid the recovery of the least developed regions or countries.
We will otherwise face the risk of seeing only formal compliance with budgetary obligations, with countries in difficulty resorting to the most varied and creative accounting systems (which also makes their rapid harmonisation a necessity), in the sole aim of keeping the Commission satisfied, as guardian of the Treaties, or of temporarily deceiving the financial markets and for a while escaping their rightful punishment.
This, unfortunately, is the situation seen in many European economies at the end of 2002.
Determining the current problems of the European economy when drawing up the balance-sheet of the degree to which the objectives outlined at the Lisbon Extraordinary summit have been attained is, therefore, absolutely crucial.
It is also necessary to make it clear to Parliament, to the Council and the Commission that it is possible to achieve a balance between healthy financial consolidation in the countries of the Union and full compliance with these objectives.
Mr President, I will try within the time available to me to comment on the four reports presented to us.
I will deal initially with the three relating to the general economic situation, the Stability and Growth Pact and public finances and finally I will comment on the report by Mr Olle Schmidt on the specific case of Sweden.
I would firstly like to thank Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo for the work he has done and, as he has said, for the clear message contained in this report with regard to the broad guidelines for economic policies.
I would like to stress that the document for this year is of a more strategic nature than usual, insofar as it is a document which intends to define the broad European strategy for the next three years.
It is true that it is being produced in a situation of particular economic uncertainty, it is true that we have given certain indications on how to act in the event of asymmetric shocks, where naturally monetary policy must be used, when there may be sectoral repercussions, a situation in which we will undoubtedly have to use specific instruments of a different nature or if we experience those unusual events which are laid down in the Community legislation and which allow us to act also in terms of budgetary policy, while accepting however, the limits of 3% laid down in the Treaty.
Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo has insisted on the need for a healthy macroeconomic policy and clearly supports the Stability and Growth Pact.
I believe we take the same approach and we have no great difficulty in accepting his recommendations.
He also refers to a point which we all believe to be fundamental and that is how we can increase the growth potential in Europe.
Unquestionably through an increase in employment and productivity.
We know that increases in productivity - you have referred to this yourself - and growth in employment are also closely related to the evolution of salaries, and that it is essential that salaries are compatible with reasonable evolution of employment and with increases in productivity.
But it is also essential - and this is the approach we adopted in Lisbon - to improve education and training.
We believe it is also essential to implement more appropriate taxation in order to achieve these objectives and of course to carry out more public and private investment.
I will discuss this in more detail when I come to the report by Mr Trentin.
In this regard, we consider it essential, within the Lisbon framework, to define the appropriate framework for both public and private investment to be carried out and to make progress on certain fundamental elements.
In recent weeks there has been an element which I would like to stress, which is the approval of the Community patent, which will undoubtedly be an innovative element and which will allow for greater European innovation and of course to define public expenditure according to criteria which will improve productivity or production.
The broad guidelines for economic policy, however, should not be seen independently from the Stability and Growth Pact.
Mr Trentin refers to this point when he points out the need to approach the Stability and Growth Pact jointly in Lisbon.
I believe we all agree that restructured public finances are essential not only in terms of allowing monetary policy to play its role, but also in order to provide the necessary margin so that the automatic stabilisers can function in a cyclical situation.
However, Mr Trentin raises something else: what more can we do, in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact, in terms of growth?
How can we ultimately improve the quality of public finances?
In his report, Mr Santos also stresses this point, which I would like to focus on further.
I believe that the key lies in greater investment in research and development.
We have set certain specific objectives on this point, since public investment in this sector functions satisfactorily but nevertheless there are more deficiencies with regard to the functioning of the private economy.
The Stability and Growth Pact, however, as modified in the Communication in November, introduces an additional element in relation to this policy so that it may further promote development in Europe.
It is true that the pact provides us with the initial means for achieving budgetary balance or a situation of surplus in the medium term.
In its analysis of the pact, however, the Commission has seen that in certain cases temporary deviations are justified provided that they are for reasons aimed at improving growth.
Our view is that physical investment and, above all, public investment is not the only element which can allow a temporary deviation in budgetary balance to be carried out within the framework of the pact.
We believe that all actions which ultimately allow us to increase our growth potential must be treated in the same way.
The Commission therefore proposed in its Communication that there could be temporary deviations in countries which fulfil certain conditions; essentially those which have low levels of ratio in relation to public debt; which furthermore have already achieved a situation of budgetary balance and which, of course, establish this type of deviation in order to increase growth.
And here we are talking about investments in infrastructures, investments in knowledge, but also measures of a fiscal nature, for example tax reductions, which may eventually allow us to improve growth.
Those are the essential elements which the Commission raised in its Communication, which have not been taken up in an entirely exact form in the final conclusions of the Council, but which nevertheless have allowed, or are allowing, sufficient progress to be made in order to achieve a result which we believe must allow us to improve in terms of growth.

What the Council says is that we must carry out analyses on a case-by-case basis, that there is no rule for this type of deviation; it does not impose any condition with regard to how the Commission must implement its proposals and naturally the Commission remains convinced that the proposals we have made so far, in a couple of specific cases, with regard to these temporary deviations, are still valid and they are the criteria we will use in the future.
With regard to the coordination of our budgetary policies, I would say that the system has improved, but that, nevertheless, we cannot be completely satisfied, since we have too many deviations.
I believe it is essential to make progress on coordination and in this regard the broad guidelines for economic policy are intended to make improvements, not only by means of the tri-annual approach, but also by paying more attention to application reports than to general approaches.
And I believe we must improve our multinational coordination systems, since - as we have highlighted in our proposals to the Convention - there are certain deficiencies in the current system which prevent 'peer pressure' from functioning in the manner which was drawn up in the Treaty.
Finally, I would say to Mr dos Santos that I am grateful for his support on the analysis of the public finances for 2002 and the quality of public finances.
That report is a key to understanding what is done subsequently, in November, when we present our proposal for a communication to the Council.
In our Commission Communication to the Council we do not intend to modify the pact or to make it more flexible.
Our intention, on the basis of our experience over recent years, is to ensure that the application of the pact is better suited to the specific situations of each of the countries involved.
We also believe it essential in our Communication that the Member States confirm their commitment to the pact.
That is why we requested a European Council resolution to allow this progress.
Though I have said this several times, it is perhaps worth repeating that we insist in our communication on certain fundamental points.
3% is still the nominal deficit limit; however, we have to take account of the evolution of the cycle and therefore the evolution of cyclically adjusted deficits is an essential element.
Secondly, in order to achieve budgetary balance in the medium term, those countries which have not yet achieved it will have to make budgetary efforts to the tune of half a point per year, as a minimum, or more in the event that there is a difference.
Thirdly, we are aware that there has been a relaxation of the budgetary policy at good times in the economic cycle, which has created subsequent problems and it is therefore essential to pay more attention to ensuring that there is no further procyclic behaviour in these circumstances.
We believe it is essential to pay attention to debt and as Mr Trentin pointed out previously, I believe it is essential to consider the specific situation of certain Member States, in such a way as they have greater room for manoeuvre.
All of this has been approved by the Ecofin Council, with the corrections which I referred to in relation to the report by Mr Trentin.
I come to my final comment on the report by Mr Schmidt.
It is true that in our convergence report on Sweden we referred to compliance with the convergence criteria with two exceptions: the legal convergence criterion, particularly in relation to the Swedish Central Bank, and non-compliance with the exchange rate convergence criterion.
We are pleased to note that, when we talk about the figures relating to development in Sweden, the remaining convergence criteria are being complied with even more comfortably than in the past.
However we have yet to deal with those two elements which I hope can be resolved in the future.
You know what our position is in relation to them.
In the legal field, the Central Bank's independence system must be adapted.
With regard to the exchange rate criterion, we have to apply the Treaty; but, as I have said many times, we will have to take account of past experiences without a doubt.
I personally believe that the adoption of the euro would be beneficial to Sweden and I hope that that country will soon fulfil the necessary conditions.
I also believe it would be beneficial for the European Union and for the eurozone in particular, since it would represent a significant advance in our process of integration.
Mr President, I should first like to thank the Commissioner and applaud his clear statement in the debate on these four reports. He said that the Commission did not wish either to make the Stability and Growth Pact more flexible or to adapt it, but that it simply wished to impose stricter standards when assessing the situation in the Member States.
I consider this to be a better policy than the proposals made by Members from the other groups, in particular those put forward by Mr Trentin and Mr dos Santos.
What Mr Trentin said here bears no relation to the report tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, nor are his comments appropriate in a debate on the subject of the annual assessment of the stability and convergence programmes.
In school I would say to Mr Trentin that he had strayed from the subject.
In his draft report there was not a single word about it, and it was only the amendments tabled by the various different groups that brought the report closer to the issue at hand.
Today you clean forgot about it once again.
I am also grateful to the Commissioner for reminding us once more of the Lisbon objectives, which are not at odds with the Stability and Growth Pact and budgetary consolidation, but in fact encapsulate all of the framework conditions: a flexible labour market and the need to increase investment, reduce taxes, and invest in research and training.
This cannot however absolve the Member States from applying strict standards in their budgetary policy, as prescribed by the Commission.
In the Trentin report we have at least demanded that in future the Commission be able to send out the blue letters on its own, without this being dependent on a vote in the Ecofin Council in which the offenders are indirectly involved.
We want to strengthen the Commission's independence.
The proposals that have been made in the reports are inconsistent in many respects. This is shown by the fact that for two years now there has been a consistent policy of calling the Stability and Growth Pact into question and of undermining it in every possible respect and with every possible proposal, with the sole aim of ensuring that the consolidation of state budgets in several Member States is no longer recognised as a necessary precondition for stable finances and a stable economic and monetary policy.
It is of course not the case that there is insufficient room for manoeuvre.
Eight out of twelve Member States in the euro zone have already managed to balance their budgets.
The offenders who are not sticking to the rules are the ones who are now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be changed.
Those that have stable budgets and that are even making a surplus are penalised because in the euro zone everyone is in the same boat, my own country, Germany, as much as any other.
If Germany with its considerable economic power does not comply with the Stability Pact then it puts the stability of the euro at risk.
We cannot deflect attention away from the Member States' responsibilities by correcting and retouching the rules.
The golden rule that appears in some of Mr dos Santos' amendments is of no use here either.
There is no such thing as good or bad debt.
There is just debt: debt in investment and infrastructure and consumer debt.
Mr Trentin, I am sure that you are familiar with the scala mobile, the debt that brought the Italian State to its knees over the last twenty years, when new debts were repeatedly accumulated, with the unions playing along with it, but no way out was found.
The European model has brought lower inflation and stable monetary policy conditions.
That is what we should keep as our basis, what we must be rigorous about keeping as our basis.
Finally, I should like to say to our Swedish Members that we welcome the fact that Sweden wishes to join the Economic and Monetary Union.
We will do all we can to help it to do so, but we ask that it be under the conditions laid down in the Maastricht Treaty.
If the government does not yet meet them - independence of the central bank or even the issue of two-year membership of the European Monetary System - then it needs to address that; it must not be allowed to let it slip.
In this respect we have every reason to thank the Commission for the line that it is taking.
Mr President, proactive and resolute leadership is needed on economic policy at the EU's spring summit.
We cannot go on trotting out the same old formulae.
Unfortunately they fall far short of what is required at a difficult time, which is not only characterised by an economic downturn but also, regrettably, by the shadows that an approaching war is casting over economic and employment policy.
That is why Parliament's reports - and I mean all of those on the table this evening - show a glimmer of hope but at the same time make demands that mercilessly expose the weaknesses in the European economy.
I should like to underline that it is out of the question to eliminate a Stability and Growth Pact that has been created to bring order to the economy. Instead we need to apply it taking into account the Lisbon objectives in a time and a place and in such a way that it makes sense, because the people of Europe deserve no less.
I think that we need to make every effort to halt the economic slide.
We cannot deny either that even the European Central Bank is now talking about risks of a downward trend in the European Union.
This means that we need to pursue a proactive policy and to that extent the repeated references to structural reforms do not serve any purpose either.
Besides, we do not yet know what economic benefits these structural reforms will bring to the European Union and we have no idea what impact they will have on employment policy.
Economic institutes, national ministries and also the Commission have not answered this question.
But we need this answer to know which direction is the right one.
I believe that the saying still holds true: employment creates growth, but growth also creates employment.
We have to work on the basis of real growth and not only on the basis of potential for growth.
I should like to point out once more that it is absolutely right - as the reports also state - for us to refer repeatedly to the lack of investment in both the private and public sectors.
We are not honouring the Lisbon agreement about 3% growth.
Neither are we respecting the agreement to invest more in research and development, and that too applies to both the private and public sectors.
Japan and the USA are streets ahead of us in both respects.
At the moment we perhaps do not really need an economic government, but coordination up and across our governments, coordination that is worthy of the name, is in the interests of growth and employment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would firstly like to express my group's agreement with the text of the reports we are discussing, but not with some of the statements which have been made on presenting them to this plenary session.
The immediate aim of this debate is essentially to prepare for the Spring Council and it is intended to respond to the corresponding assessment of the so-called 'Lisbon process', complemented by the decisions of the Gothenburg and Barcelona Councils.
Within this context, I would firstly like to express my concern and that of my group at the fact that the aim established for 2010 of being a more competitive economy with higher quality and greater levels of employment has not been achieved.
When assessing these three years, despite the difficulties of the American economy, we find that, in terms of growth, productivity levels and employment levels, we are further behind than three years ago.
It is therefore clear that there is a very worrying difference between what is preached in the Councils and what is practiced in the Member States, and this prejudices the Union's overall result.
We in the Liberal Group believe that the main problems principally stem from the lack of compliance with the liberalisation processes agreed, since, as the report by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil points out, there are still significant structural reforms to be carried out and certain basic markets, such as the labour market, must be made even more flexible.
In the current situation, which is not exactly one of the best economic situations the European Union has been in in recent years, there are three key aspects which particular attention must also be paid to.
Firstly, we must improve the level not just of research and development but of its application within the productive system.
Let us hope that this historic agreement on the European patent, as Commissioner Solbes has mentioned, will provide promotion in this area, but that it will also pay special attention to the creation and development of small and medium-sized businesses based on the application of new technologies, because, as was demonstrated in the 1990s, they are significant sources of work.
I do not have the time to mention other issues, Mr President, but I would like to end as I began: rather than making grand statements in Spring Councils, we must comply with what has been agreed.
Mr President, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil calls a spade a spade. He stated that the European Union does not have an economic policy.
He has contributed to a good debate and I thank him for this.
In considering causes and solutions, the notion of inflexibility and structural reform are often bandied about.
We are forever asking the Commission, the ECB and the experts what they mean.
I have been struck by the imprecise and inconsistent nature of the responses.
At a remarkable conference, Mr Adair Turner, the Director-General of the CBI, said that we must be careful about dismantling the Welfare State and that the agenda for liberalisation in Europe, although useful, represents only a partial response to present challenges.
Clearly, the problem of pensions will not be resolved unless there is a large increase in employment rates in Europe.
It is essential to mobilise all human potential.
A great deal of work will have to go into reforming the labour markets, especially as regards training and qualifications. We must, however, remember that this involves reorganisation and there will be a price to pay.
We must consider why there is a lack of productive public and private investment.
One of the reasons relates to the flow of capital, much of which ends up in the United States.
Though the financial market might have stimulated global investment over the last decade, I think it is a fallacy to believe that the market itself will initiate a new round of investments in Europe.
It does not provide for local development or for the development of SMEs and infrastructure.
The European Union should be able to finance effective networks of services of general interest and develop policies on productive enterprises.
We do not only have a supply problem; we also underestimate the problem of demand.
Hundreds of billions in paying off goodwill are putting a serious strain on business and are hampering recovery.
Far from fearing inflation, the European Central Bank should amend its target and reduce its real rates below zero.
Furthermore, even if some Member States have not known how to reform their public finances or been unable to do so in time, the seriousness of the present climate justifies taking measures to support activity, including waiving the 3% rule as a temporary measure.
There are two more points I would like to make. I believe war against Iraq is not just madness, but economic folly too.
It will increase public deficits pointlessly in both the United States and Europe, when we want to reduce them.
As one of our experts said, the United States is skating on very thin ice.
The future growth of that country will require us to make even greater demands on our capital reserves. This is yet another contradiction.
Europe cannot therefore just tag along with the United States.
Europe must devise a policy of her own.
We in Europe have our backs against the wall.
The Convention, however, is silent.
As for the calls for economic government, they bring to mind a scene from the film Shoulder Arms. In it a military unit is engulfed in fog, everyone is stumbling around and a soldier is heard calling for his captain.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to recognise that there are a number of reports on broadly the same subject.
This being the case, we will not support the report drafted by Mr Trentin, whom I greatly admire. We will consider instead Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil's report.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is faced with a real operational problem.
When a rapporteur from the left and a rapporteur from the right decide to address the same issue, the report from the left is pulled to pieces by honourable Members on the right. With a bit of luck, the report is approved when it is put forward by a rapporteur from the right.
We must therefore recognise that the GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil report is much better and much more useful than Mr Trentin's, now that it has been cut to ribbons by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Be that as it may, I have long acknowledged that Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil has demonstrated considerable qualities in his role as a rapporteur.
As Mr Langen said, the Trentin report is clearly not actually a report drawn up by Mr Trentin.
Mr Trentin's speech almost entirely contradicted the contents of his report.
I will therefore only comment on the contents of the GarcÃ­a Margallo y Marfil report, in its present form.
It is my belief that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support all the objectives and comments on the subject as included in the GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil report. It has the virtue of bringing the objectives of economic policy back into line with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
We want to ensure that Europe is a model of economic growth. Growth should be based on high-quality investment in human resources, high-calibre public investment and on the use of environmentally-sustainable technologies.
Given the size of the continent of Europe, which has one of the highest population concentrations in the world, it is my belief that this is the only way forward for the European Union.
The GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil report does contain discrepancies.
It is forced to juggle the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact must be welcomed, while also acknowledging the need to finance investments. It acknowledges that the article in the Treaty of Maastricht which prevents European institutions from criticising the European Central Bank must not be undermined, while also stating that it is nonetheless necessary to provide credit at special rates for the required investments.
It mentions taxation, not interest rates.
In short, the report tends to skirt round the real problems of institutional impasse we are currently experiencing within the European Union. Next year these problems will catapult us back into the situation of so-called europaralysis we experienced during the dark years of working towards the euro from 1990 to 1997.
As we cannot control the interest rates fixed by the European Central Bank, interest rates will be too high. This will present problems for Member States wishing both to invest and pay off their debts.
These excessive interest rates will also make the euro too strong. It will hamper exports at a time of global recession.
Unless we resolve to tackle the Stability and Growth Pact as it currently stands, we will be unable to finance the investments Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil calls for.
.
(NL) Mr President, in this joint debate on a number of reports, we are discussing the progress of Economic and Monetary Union, a Union that exists by the grace of compliance with agreements made.
The Stability and Growth Pact is an agreement, an agreement that we must hold one another to.
The words that Mr Trentin writes about the Stability Pact in his report are worth reading.
He says that even in periods of economic recession the pact must be adhered to closely and I am in complete agreement with this.
Nor must we now go back on that.
Likewise Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil rightly says that the European leaders at the forthcoming spring summit must dispense with vague and self-satisfied declarations and must speak plainly.
Clear agreements about the way in which we wish to achieve the economic objectives remain necessary to comply with the pact even in this period of recession.
I am therefore greatly amazed when it appears once again that France is unwilling to comply with the agreements made.
Last Thursday it again became clear that this Member State would make no attempt to put its 2003 budget straight.
Where Germany, Portugal and Italy are trying to put their budgets right within the agreements made, France, on the contrary, does not even express its intention finally to give account for the agreements made.
Let me conclude, Mr President, by saying that if this Parliament wishes to make a serious contribution to policy-making in the economic field, then it is high time that we summoned the Member States and politicians that are unwilling to comply with these agreements to this place to give account.
Mr President, Commissioner, the reports being discussed today are major, substantial documents - before I start I must pay tribute to the rapporteurs for that - and they represent a major contribution to the debate on the policy guidelines for public finances in Europe.
The radical Members will support them in their present form.
I do not want to go into the details of the individual resports, but I would like to take this opportunity to make some more general comments.
Firstly, I believe that we should be a little mistrustful of high-sounding slogans and goals such as the Lisbon objectives, to which we are constantly referring.
I do not feel that the fact that Europe decided at a certain juncture to set itself, and I quote once again: 'a new strategic goal for the next decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth' and all the other goals we are familiar with is either a great leap forward or the basis for a new economic policy for the Member States, unless we think that, in the past, the States did not want to make their countries competitive countries and did not want to aim at full employment.
In addition to constantly stressing these objectives and performing analyses - the European Parliament is a political body, not a research centre - I feel we should discuss the reason why these high-sounding goals are not being met and which are the political costs which we in Europe do not have the courage to face in order to achieve them, to convert them into practical reforms, the reforms discussed in the reports before us today.
I feel that the European economic structures need to be completely overhauled.
We are continually referring with pride to the European social model and the social market economy, but then we state explicitly in the reports - I think this is the case with Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo's report - that the fate of the European social model is dependent on US economic recovery: if there is no economic recovery in the United States there will be no economic growth in Europe, and the social model we are so proud of will experience much more difficult times than those we are already experiencing today.
The economic crisis in Germany is an indication of the crisis of an old economic model, the model of an old Europe which has nothing left to invest.
We state repeatedly in the reports that we need more public investment - although we do not say where we are to find the money - and more private investment.
I do not believe that private investment in Europe is low because of interest rates or, therefore, that our only objective should be to pressurize the European Central Bank to give us a more flexible interest rate policy, thereby facilitating private investment.
Private investment will not increase because of lower interest rates: it will increase if and when we have a more flexible economy, with flexibility introduced in large doses.
Reforms to make the economy more flexible carry a political cost, and we are failing to discuss that cost: there is a price to be paid for meddling with the structure of the labour market and going against the powerful lobbies constituted by the monopolies - half of the European Union's budget is tied up in agricultural subsidies and protection - and there is a political cost for considering using these resources to spark off a new wave of investment in high technology and scientific research.
I will end with a comment on the subject of pensions: the need for rigorous national budgets arises, first and foremost, from the need for national budgets to have the capacity to deal with the problems related to the aging of the population and the costs derived from the structural reform of the pensions systems.
We owe this to the future generations of European citizens.
Mr President, I want to keep my speech on the Convergence Report 2002 - Sweden fairly short and, first of all, thank the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, on a sterling piece of work.
On 1 January 2002, the euro was introduced as the currency, in notes and coinage, of 12 European Union countries.
The transition was very successful, and people accepted the new currency in a positive way.
Worries about price increases proved to be more or less unjustified.
As everyone knows, Sweden is not among those countries that went over to using the euro as a currency.
The reason for this was, of course, mainly political.
If Sweden is to be able to introduce the euro as a currency, we must however formally meet five convergence criteria.
The Commission and the ECB consider that Sweden fulfils the three criteria relating to price stability, public sector finances and long-term interest rates.
That is all well and good, but Sweden does not fulfil the remaining two criteria, that is to say those relating to the rate of exchange and legal convergence.
With regard to the rate of exchange criterion, the Swedish krona has obviously fluctuated in value in recent years.
It should however be borne in mind that, when Sweden formally requests a reappraisal, this will be carried out in the course of a second reference period and against a background of expectations that may tend to increase exchange rate stability.
When it comes to legal convergence, it is essential for Sweden as soon as possible to introduce the change in Swedish legislation that is required if the euro is to be introduced.
The outcome of the forthcoming referendum must of course be respected but, in my opinion, Sweden should, in the event of a 'yes' vote, already be prepared to prevent a delay in the introduction of the euro due to the absence of legal convergence.
With all due respect for the convergence criteria, the decision concerning Swedish participation in the third phase of EMU is political.
It is a decision that will be made by the Swedish people.
In the referendum of 14 September 2003, the Swedish people will decide for a long time to come which currency is to be used in Sweden.
On the other hand, Sweden is obliged, under the Treaty of Maastricht, to become fully involved in EMU cooperation once the convergence criteria have been fulfilled.
Unlike Denmark and Great Britain, Sweden has no special exemption clause, but we shall hopefully obtain a 'yes' vote from the Swedish people on 14 September.
As a result, the Swedish Government need no longer, either intentionally or unintentionally, delay or avoid taking the measures whereby Sweden will fulfil the remaining convergence criteria.
I noted with satisfaction that Mr Olle Schmidt accepted Amendments Nos 3 and 4 by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
This will make it possible to obtain that broad support for the report desired by both the rapporteur and myself.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, three of the reports before us this evening provide an opportunity for us to assess the functioning of economic and monetary union prior to the Spring European Council.
Turning to the situation of public finances in France, one cannot help remarking that economic policy is not considered as an issue of common interest.
The Treaty is not being respected.
One cannot help remarking too that economic and monetary union does not actually exist, certainly as far as economic union is concerned.
The Stability and Growth Pact is at the heart of these mechanisms. Nevertheless, it appears to be more of a safeguard rather than a tool of economic policy.
The adoption of the Lisbon strategy could subsequently have been the catalyst that would have provided the economic and monetary union with an economic policy.
In short, the Stability and Growth Pact has not proved to be a dynamic tool for implementing this strategy.
In principle, the tools we have at our disposal are the famous broad economic policy guidelines we are discussing again this evening. These will galvanise approaches on European Union economic policy in the weeks and months to come.
What could the outcome be, Commissioner?
At present these broad economic policy guidelines are functioning as an academic exercise. They are not having any impact on the public finances of the Member States, which simply wait for penalties to be imposed through the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact once it is too late.
Europe needs a strategy for growth. You said so yourself in your speech.
This means we need more tools than we currently have available.
Commissioner, the Council has just expressed its opinion on your statement.
I think we need to go further and we must do so at the Convention.
I think that we must work together to establish mutually acceptable proposals. We should draw up measures which will at long last endow the European Union with the means not only to develop a genuine economic policy, but also to conceive of it as serving the common good and to implement the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.
Mr President, I do not have the time to delve into the possible differences between the text of the reports and the personal views of each of the rapporteurs. I will therefore focus my comments on the Commission's statement and on the contribution of the Commissioner, and will offer both my strong support.
In my view, the Commission is fulfilling its role as guardian of the treaties on this matter perfectly. I believe the Stability and Growth Pact is not dead.
I believe that above and beyond the arguably controversial statements made at the end of last year on formulas that could be perceived as risky, it is important to insist upon the distinction between the letter and the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact and to ensure that its spirit is kept alive. The Maastricht criteria mean we are committed to a monetary union that is also a political union based on a number of values.
The stability on which the euro is based goes beyond the technical definition of the concept. It amounts to a mutual agreement on a form of social contract.
As well as being a strong currency, the euro must above all be a stable currency. In proclaiming this principle, Europe is setting aside its bad habits of the twentieth century, characterised by inflation, which represented a tax for poor people.
Europe has decided to commit itself to being a confident society with a stake in the future.
These are the values we are presenting to the countries about to join the European Union.
Herein lies another reason not to alter these values by taking imprudent action which would undermine them.
When players are not doing well at a game, they do not ask for the rules to be changed, but learn them instead.
Mr President, as you will appreciate, Mr Olle Schmidt's report is being read with great interest in Sweden, which is to hold a referendum on the introduction of the euro in September.
Item 6 of this report states that the introduction of the euro is part of the Treaty obligations for all the Member States, including Sweden in other words.
Item 5 states, however, that referendums are to be held and that the outcomes of these must be respected, even if they entail rejecting the introduction of the euro.
This comes across as being extremely self-contradictory.
Mr Olle Schmidt hopes that the Swedish people will vote 'yes' and so resolve this contradiction.
There is not much, however, to indicate that they will do so.
On the contrary, the 'no' camp is at present very clearly in the lead, by ten per cent according to the latest poll.
The trend suggests that this lead will become ever greater.
It may also be worth Parliament's knowing that, among those who say 'no', are quite a few ministers in the Swedish Government, including the minister for trade and industry, Leif Pagrotsky, at least two former presidents of the Swedish Central Bank and a long list of highly regarded economists, who all believe that Sweden should vote 'no'.
The situation does not therefore reflect the classic picture of an educated Europhile Ã©lite and an uninformed populace.
What we have instead is a political debate demanding objectivity and arguments on both sides.
Sweden has a well-run economy.
In the years during which Sweden has not been involved in cooperation concerning the euro, its economy has, in almost all respects, been strengthened in relation to those of the eurozone countries.
Swedish industry traditionally asserts that the euro community is at all events good for trade.
The business 'paper, AffÃ€rsvÃ€rlden has recently shown that this too is not the case.
The economists sympathetic to EMU cannot deny this state of affairs.
They therefore say, as Mrs GrÃ¶nfeldt Bergman just did, that the arguments in favour of EMU are not economic but political.
It does not sound especially convincing when it is economists who say this, as if they were arguing in favour of entering this political union on grounds contrary to those of practical economic sense.
It is not easy to sell this message to the Swedish people.
The truth is that EMU has not been the success it was expected to be.
The Stability and Growth Pact is coming up against evermore criticism, and economic stagnation is increasingly widespread.
For Sweden, the German economy is particularly important, but it is a difficult task right now to convince the Swedish people to make their future dependent upon the German economy.
This issue concerns not only Sweden, but also the UK and Denmark.
We shall soon also have a range of new Member States that are also outside the framework of cooperation concerning the euro.
In those countries, too, there may perhaps be referendums on the euro and, as a result, the euro may be rejected there.
In that situation, the definitive question must be asked: what should the EU and the European Central Bank do if Sweden and perhaps other Member States were to elect to stay outside the currency union?
Is it possible to contemplate a euro community that is voluntary in character?
What, in actual fact, do the Commission and the Council have to say about these matters?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, our group voted against this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
In its current form, this report fails to challenge the principles of the neo-liberal credo, which unfortunately are at the heart of many Community policies.
Yesterday, the dock workers brought this home to us forcefully in this very city and with every justification.
The report does not query the validity of the stability and growth programmes to any significant extent.
It is worth considering the meaning of the terms 'growth' and 'stability'.
By definition, things that are 'stable' do not grow. Growth means movement; stability means the opposite.
Certainly, the reality is dialectical in nature.
On the other hand, this use of words could be construed as an attempt to resolve a contradiction.
The report appears to reject any initiative to make the stability and growth criteria more flexible, and particularly the famous 3% criterion.
Given the present economic difficulties, some Member States, and not just the smallest among them, are finding it increasingly difficult to comply with the 3% rule.
Will this remedy kill the patient?
We should note that experts from both the European Union and Member States gave overly optimistic predictions of growth.
We hoped that the American economy would show signs of recovery, and that the European economy would follow suit. This has not happened, however.
The policies pursued by Member States and the European Union were therefore based on inaccurate data.
In this respect, the rigidity of the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact seems to run counter to the fundamentals of good governance.
People better qualified than I on this subject have spoken strongly on the matter.
We should envisage policies of Keynesian cyclic recovery.
We should also consider policies aimed at achieving long-term improvement of the bases of the economy. These include, for example, energy efficiency and the provision of training.
I would like to add that good governance implies reliable economic data, meaning the State must benefit from the Rule of Law. The fact that the Basque newspaper Egunkaria has been banned for six months makes one wonder whether the Basque country is still within a country where the Rule of Law prevails.
Mr President, we are currently engaged in a debate over the breaking of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This mainly concerns just three countries, namely France, Germany and Portugal. We should remember that, when considering the budget or any other subject, we must not fail to see the wood for the trees.
The three countries with the highest deficits have one thing in common. They have all had socialist governments.
I would add that Germany still has a socialist government. These governments have been lax on public spending and have failed to implement reforms which could have achieved savings.
They have wasted the margins for manoeuvre achieved through the growth in the years 2000/2001. We are now dealing with the bitter consequences of this.
This particular tree must not obscure our vision.
The real problem is the general decline in public balances in the eurozone. This stood at less than 2.4% of GDP in 2002, close to the 3% criterion.
The main cause of this is the slowdown in the growth rate, and the tide is not yet turning, even slowly. This goes against the somewhat unrealistic assertions of the reports we are considering this evening.
One of the possible causes of this slowdown is the economic climate. The main cause, however, is to be found in the huge public payments and the lack of structural flexibility.
No solutions have yet been found for the latter. In this respect, we must break the taboo and ask whether in fact the euro itself forms part of the rigid structures holding back growth.
In view of the marked differences in performance between the eurozone and the countries outside the euro, the question certainly needs to be asked.
Given that we are losing ground, should the Stability and Growth Pact be made more flexible?
I am aware that the response from the Commission, the European Central Bank and even the last Ecofin Council was overwhelmingly negative, although a number of minor modifications were put forward.
With respect to both the Stability and Growth Pact and foreign policy, the European Union, as usual, does not want to face reality. Instead it wants to paper over the ways in which we are slipping behind on meeting fundamental criteria.
In our opinion, we should not lose sight of the objective of completely eliminating public deficits. This is certainly a laudable aim.
We think, however, that the French Government is right to maintain their programme of reducing taxation in order to avoid aggravating the current crisis.
We have to address a situation we have inherited and that is not of our making. We must at least try to do so in an intelligent way.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for reminding us all once again of the corner stones - not only because these are uncertain times, but also because this has been a very confusing debate - and for not setting them against each other either, but reminding us that they are principles of European economic policy.
I should like to start where Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm left off.
We are not setting new objectives.
We are not making new promises or developing new hypotheses and analyses. What we are doing is finally taking ourselves seriously.
If you do not take yourself seriously, then others will not take you seriously either.
Some of us complain about the common principles of economic policy and at the same time criticise the fact that they are not respected.
We regret the fact that growth, productivity and employment are falling, and that we are not making up ground but are lagging behind, and some of us think that the response to this diagnosis is more state intervention and more debt.
Do the Members on the Left really believe this, even though at the same time we have to acknowledge that we do not even meet all of the objectives that we have set ourselves?
We talk about the rules, but at the same time we say - at least some of us do - that the rules should not be respected in such and such a case by such and such a country.
At the same time, we regret the crisis of confidence in Europe about many economic policy measures and the principles and objectives of the European Union.
You only create confidence with accountability and you only create accountability if you keep to and act on the things you resolve to do, both at European level and in the Member States.
That is why I say very clearly on behalf of my group that we say 'yes' to the internal market.
If we say 'yes' to the internal market however we must finally see to it that the barriers in the internal market are eliminated, that we really do create an action plan for financial services, that we really do implement the Risk Capital Action Plan, that we really do make the Charter for Small Enterprises a reality.
We say 'yes' to competition policy.
But that also means that we must, at last, eliminate tax provisions that distort competition.
For some types of tax, such as value-added tax, energy tax, corporation tax and the taxation of pension funds, a convergence programme is necessary.
We say 'yes' to the Lisbon strategy, but if we say 'yes' to the Lisbon strategy then we also have to say 'yes' to a model of the market economy that takes account of environmental and social concerns and does not constantly play the market off against social security.
This also means that we finally need to ensure that with each piece of legislation we identify its economic impact and its impact on employment and the environment before we adopt it, rather than waiting until afterwards to be allowed to complain about the consequences.
We say 'yes' to a benchmark. We must learn from each other.
And we say 'yes' to the Stability Pact because it provides an ordered framework, and that is why we also say 'no' to the golden rules, because they undermine the Stability Pact and we would thereby be stabbing the Commission, the guardian of the Treaties, in the back and betraying the Stability and Growth objectives.
Mr President, my home country, Sweden, will be holding a referendum on the euro this autumn.
In spite of the fact that we are still not part of the eurozone, we are nonetheless actively attempting to fulfil the convergence criteria and to respect the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Commission and the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, point out that, on two issues - the rate of exchange and legislation concerning the Swedish Central Bank - Sweden does not meet the requirements.
I believe that it will be possible quickly to fulfil the requirements regarding these issues if the outcome of the referendum is a 'yes' vote.
Our respect for these rules does not only have to do with the fact that they exist as external demands. Rather, it primarily has to do with the fact that we ourselves perceive that they are beneficial to the Swedish economy, which has also constantly been improving.
At present, we have relatively low inflation and low unemployment, together with stable state finances.
What is more, we have higher growth than many other countries.
These are basically good rules.
It would therefore be dangerous to begin to ignore these rules, together with budgetary discipline, as soon as some people have problems.
That would undermine confidence in the euro and EMU.
Notwithstanding the approach pursued by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in certain amendments, there are reasons for developing the rules of the pact in the long term.
Allow me to mention a few examples, for instance concerning the matter of price stability.
Clearly, we must stick to the inflation target, but, for example, the two per cent requirement could possibly be the average for an economic cycle, so that inflation could be one per cent in one year and three per cent in another.
That is something that would favour growth and increase flexibility.
The same applies to state finances.
The Commission has put forward an interesting proposal whereby countries with low national debts should be given increased opportunities to provide loans for long-term investments.
That is something I believe would be constructive.
Allow me finally to say that, for both political and economic reasons, I hope that Sweden will soon be involved in cooperation concerning the euro.
If we can strengthen and unify Europe in a situation in which the dollar's and the United States's dominance is so powerful and, at the same time, reduce the risk of new currency and interest crises, then I obviously think that the Swedes should vote in favour of the euro.
I should like to express my thanks, especially to Mr Olle Schmidt who has produced a truly excellent report of which I shall vote in favour.
Mr President, what has surprised me most in this debate is that nothing shakes the faith of some Members in the rigidity of the criteria for nominal convergence.
Neither the major economic downturn nor the reduction in private investment, nor the steady rise in unemployment and poverty shake their faith in the dogmas of the Stability Pact, whose budgetary and monetary rigidity has not only contributed to worsening the current economic crisis but has also limited the potential for growth in the European Union, with all the consequences this has for the increasingly high levels of inequality, poverty and social exclusion.
This situation is particularly serious, however, for the cohesion countries, such as Portugal, whose specific problems require a dynamic public sector and major public investment in order to attain a high level of real convergence, which is being hampered by the blind application of the Stability Pact's irrational criteria.
As we all know, globalisation should make monetary and budgetary policies more flexible towards the specific needs of each country and not lead to the rigid approach currently being applied, which ends up imposing flexibility on salaries and the labour market, giving pride of place to monetary policies and attaching far less importance to social policies.
I regret the fact that the Committee on Economic Affairs did not consider the proposal I tabled, urging the Commission and the Council immediately to suspend the Stability Pact and calling for an in-depth revision of the EU's economic and monetary policy guidelines, particularly in order to take account of issues such as the sustainable economic development of employment and the implementation of all social rights through universal and high-quality public services.
It makes no economic sense to set the same budgetary deficit threshold for countries that have different levels of development, and nor is there any economic justification for sacrificing everything in the name of zero deficit.
It is therefore clear that the fundamental objective of the pact is political, and this is why we are also unhappy about the proposals that have been put forward here, specifically by the Commission.
Mr President, my contribution relates exclusively to Mr Olle Schmidt's report.
I wish to congratulate him on this work, even though I do not share his conclusions, for he has not only succeeded in responding to the Commission's Convergence Report on Sweden, but has also taken the opportunity of making a contribution to the EMU debate in Sweden before the referendum in September.
I would ask my fellow MEPs to be alert to what is stated in the report, for I find certain parts of it both erroneous and startling.
Firstly, Mr Olle Schmidt writes that prices have not risen in those countries that have introduced the euro.
According to both Wim Duisenberg and a report in the Swedish daily, Dagens Nyheter, prices have in fact risen following the introduction of the euro and contributed to an increase in inflation in the eurozone of 0.2 per cent.
Secondly, Mr Schmidt offers a false picture of the Swedish economy.
He maintains that, in terms of trade, Sweden has been slipping behind because we have not introduced the euro.
He does not, however, mention that Sweden has higher growth and lower unemployment than most countries that have the euro, and without in fact having either high inflation or a budget deficit.
What I find startling, not to say of serious concern, in Mr Schmidt's report is item 6, through which he wishes to make voters feel powerless by stating right now that, sooner or later, we must at all events become members of the eurozone.
To that extent, the report is a biased contribution to the EMU debate in Sweden.
Mr President, the downturn in the economy has proved to be deeper and longer-lasting than was first thought.
The present situation clearly highlights how important the Lisbon strategy for growth and competition is.
The Union was to have become the world's most competitive region by 2010 and an engine for growth, as our Member States' leaders put it so beautifully at Lisbon.
It all seems to have gone differently, however.
In the last three years Europe has become a continent where the sun is setting, one which cannot keep its promises, which is betraying the confidence of its citizens, and which is leaving future generations to inherit only debts and uncovered pension liabilities.
Can we really not do any better than this?
Only three countries - Denmark, Sweden and Finland - have done what was agreed at Lisbon.
Ireland, Great Britain and the Netherlands have also made considerable progress.
The three biggest economies in the euro area, however, have not done enough up till now.
If we were at school, ladies and gentlemen, Germany, Italy and France would be kept down a year.
I would not use such harsh words normally, but this is a serious business.
What in your opinion, after all, does a press report tell you which says that at present a hundred Germans lose their jobs every hour?
International business cycles obviously play their part, but this does not alter the fact that our economic structures are so constrained that they are a huge barrier to growth.
Moreover, when we then try to eliminate these structural problems, for example with the directive on port services, a whole crowd of brawlers and egotistic anarchists gather in front of the European Parliament.
At the moment we do not need new targets or new complicated rules.
Now is the time for action.
This means genuine commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact and structural reforms.
If Member States are to be allowed to deviate from the objective of balancing public finances under the Stability and Growth Pact, this will give out quite the wrong signal.
In practice this would lead to rules that are open to interpretation, and would weaken our credibility and our ultimate objectives in coordinating economic policy even further.
Mr President, a fiscal responsibility for Member States is a must, inside or outside the eurozone.
It would be disastrous for us to act recklessly and even worse for countries to consider themselves above an agreement which disciplines us all for the sake of a stable eurozone.
Having said that, I am and have always been in favour of an intelligent and flexible interpretation.
Clearly there is room for improvement.
I am sure the Commission recognises this.
The economic cycle calls for more than an annual disapproval.
Monitoring over such a short period of time is incompatible with real-time analysis.
I am sympathetic to Mr Santos' view that the cyclically adjusted deficit approved over the economic cycle is both sensible and prudent.
Growth and stability are twin pillars.
The Lisbon Summit gave voice to the possibility of a single market which was matched by investment in training and release of capital through the use of the financial services action plan, complemented by the risk capital action plan.
However, we are still falling behind competitively.
There are no high walls to keep the market out.
The EU is increasingly in danger of being left out.
The risk to the Community of not tackling substantial structural reforms is too great to be ignored.
If we delay now, that will worsen, not ameliorate, economic downturns.
Today's discussions have been entertaining and humorous in many respects.
In particular I thank Mr Olle Schmidt for the view that Sweden will join the euro and hopefully set a very good example for the UK, which will join very shortly afterwards.
Mr President, it should be noted that, though the institutions of the European Union happily preach to the smaller countries of Europe if they do not meet the convergence criteria, they take a much more moderate tone in addressing two of the European powerhouses, namely France and Germany!
Maastricht criteria or not, these two Member States have taken it on themselves to increase their deficits in order to support capitalist ventures in their countries.
The attitude of the French Government demonstrates how France and Germany will respond to the injunctions of the European institutions, if they do so at all.
They may perhaps reduce their budgetary deficits, but they will not do so by reducing the considerable sums of money they give to employers.
In France, this amounts to at least 10% of the budget.
There is certainly scope for making good a 3.4% deficit.
In order to avoid reducing the money allocated to business, however, the French Government is cutting public spending.
In truth, this means taking money away from public services. The requirement to balance the budget will mean less money for hospitals and schools.
The population as a whole will suffer so that the wealthy can get away scot-free.
Although it is in fact the Member States, rather than the European institutions, who decide on their budget, we shall vote against this report as it serves as a cover and a justification for austerity measures and assaults on public services.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon strategy can only succeed if we promote competition between the European systems.
In other words, we are concerned here with competition between economic solutions and, above all, with the best solutions to emerge from competition between the EU governments.
That also ties in with the basic idea of subsidiarity in Europe.
To put it in plain language, there should simply be no further increase in cooperation concerning economic policy, meaning that macro-economic policy ought quite simply not to fall within the competence of the EU.
Socio-political objectives too, such as bringing about full employment, promoting social cohesion or establishing a balanced relationship between competition and public service are contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and competition.
Moreover, we should - in my view, anyway - also take care that such objectives do not find their way into the EU constitution.
What is more, we also need competition in the tax field, that is to say between European tax systems.
Nor, above all, should we go on using the open coordination method in the form currently under discussion.
In other words, we need, in the future too, an economic policy for which the Member States themselves continue to be responsible.
In my view, only competition between economic policy objectives will, in the end, also lead to local conditions within the European Union that, against the background of general worldwide competition, may be further strengthened.
Mr President, I would like to thank everybody who has taken part in this debate for the ideas and issues proposed and raised.
I believe we have dealt well with the Union's two great instruments for coordinating economic policies, the broad guidelines for economic policies and the Stability and Growth Pact, instruments which, although they are linked, must not be confused.
It is the case that, since the Lisbon strategy was drawn up, the broad guidelines for economic policy have essentially been aimed at improving the Union's growth potential.
It is also the case that we often tend to compare what happens in the European Union with what happens in the United States in a rather simplistic way.
We must not forget that, for example, it is not the same to compare growth in productivity in the United States and the European Union with growth in productivity per hour in the United States and the European Union.
To put it another way, when we compare the United States with Europe, we know that in the United States the population is growing more, there is more active population and more hours are worked.
There are clearly other factors involved in terms of productivity and which affect the labour market.
This apart, however, there are two elements which I do believe to be important.
They are both in our synthesis report.
What has happened between 1999, when we launched the Lisbon process, and now?
We have seen that, in terms of employment growth, the Union has grown more rapidly than in the past and we have come closer to the activity rate of the United States.
Nevertheless, our productivity has decreased in comparison with the United States.
This highlights that there are certain elements which are failing in the European Union, which are clearly related to the labour market in a broad sense, but which also relate to the deficiencies in the internal market, to the financial market, to lack of investments and to training and all those elements we have tried to introduce in the priorities, particularly for 2004, which we presented to the Spring Council, in order to improve our capacity and productivity in the future.
Within this context, is the Stability and Growth Pact an obstacle to recovery in Europe?
I believe not.
I believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is a guarantee which will allow us, when we are able to improve our growth capacity and there is the possibility of growth, to make use of it in the best possible way.
The Stability and Growth Pact, by means of automatic stabilisers, has provided the Union with clear fiscal impetus.
We must not forget that, in very broad simplistic terms, each point that activity falls implies more or less a half a point increase in public deficit, which is approximately double what usually happens in the United States.
Does a further discretional fiscal policy in the Union make sense?
We believe that an asymmetric shock clearly raises problems which are not going to be resolved through elements of general taxation policy.
Asymmetric shocks must be resolved through defining monetary policy and only in very exceptional circumstances does discretional fiscal policy make sense in the event of an asymmetric shock.
However, we have introduced the room for manoeuvre into the pact which I referred to earlier, but we have introduced it in connection with that Lisbon growth potential.
I know that, in relation to the elements I have just mentioned with regard to the pact, you may say to me that these instruments count in those countries with budgetary positions below 3% in terms of deficit.
And this is true.
The Commission believes - and I am personally convinced - that the 3%, in nominal terms, should be the fundamental anchor of our entire system.
We must define a reference which is untouchable for everybody and I believe that that is the reference we have to work on.
But it is not a reference which we have defined and to which we are too stubbornly attached and which cannot be changed.
Let us imagine simply what the budgetary situation would be in those countries which began with relatively low budgetary deficit definitions if we had allowed the growth in public deficit to function, as has happened in the United States for example.
It is the case that, in our system, those countries which exceed the 3%, at times with less fall in activity, must behave in a somewhat procyclic manner, but that situation is the result of not having fulfilled the obligations to reduce deficits in situations of higher growth.
In summary, I believe the instruments we have will allow us to confront the current situation with a certain degree of coordination.
If I am asked whether we should be satisfied, I must say that we have made progress, but not that we should be entirely satisfied.
You have raised some of the elements of concern to us all.
You have said that it is essential that what is agreed is fulfilled.
I completely agree with this principle and I believe it is one of the essential faults we currently have in our coordination system.
Others have referred to the need to pay more attention to compliance with what is agreed and not to agree new things.
This is why in the broad guidelines for economic policy we are paying much more attention to application reports than to the definition of new broad guidelines, which we propose should be tri-annual.
With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, however, we have also constantly insisted on the need to achieve greater ownership on the part of the various Member States.
It is essential that the Member States accept and reiterate their commitment to complying with the Stability Pact and that that commitment is not simply formal, but that it is made reality.
Only if we are able to make progress on all these elements will we have a departure point which will allow us to grow rapidly when the economic context changes.
I believe that our fundamental balances are in a relatively comfortable position at the moment.
We are aware that our growth rates are relatively low.
We are aware that we are being very much affected by external factors and that we have not been capable of being more independent from them, but we believe this is an excellent departure point for confronting the problems which may arise in the future and for taking advantage of opportunities for growth in the best possible way at the point when they arise.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
- The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0042/2003) by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (11212/4/2002 - C5-0534/2002 - 2000/0260(COD)) (Rapporteur: Othmar Karas).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, at the beginning of my speech on this report, to thank three groups of people: firstly, and especially, the representatives of the Spanish and Danish Presidencies.
The Spanish Presidency made the common position possible, and the Danish Presidency worked hard at seeking dialogue with us.
I am also glad and grateful that, in the last week, the Greek Presidency has set aside its self-imposed ban on engaging in talks.
I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein's political staff and secretariat for their constant readiness to engage in discussions with us and to work with us on reaching compromises.
Finally, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Kuckelkorn and Mr Huhne, together with my committee colleagues, who were extremely flexible and who conducted themselves in such a way as consistently to help us bring about this directive without our having to jettison the principles we laid down at first reading.
I should like to thank them most sincerely for their contribution.
The second point I should like to make is that this directive has also clearly shown the problems we have where legislative procedure is concerned.
In October 2000, we received the Commission proposal; and Parliament concluded the first reading in July 2001; but it was not until 5 November 2002 that the common position was made known to us.
Today we have the second reading debate, and tomorrow the vote.
As this needs to be recalled to mind, I would take this opportunity to state very clearly that we wanted to show our ability to conclude such an important directive at first reading.
Parliament's first reading produced 458 votes in favour.
If the Council had accepted this gesture of cooperation on our part, we should already have had this directive long ago.
My third point, which I make partly in response to a number of today's press reports, is that this directive is neither a pensions directive nor a directive concerned with social insurance products.
Nor does it just have to do with occupational retirement provision.
As its name suggests, it is a directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision. That needs to be stated, because we are concerned here with a financial services directive.
That being said, many wishes have of course been expressed to me in terms of defining the benefits, designing the products, and so on. When they hear the words 'occupational retirement provision', people ask what the benefits are for themselves at a time of prevailing uncertainty in all the Member States where pensions are concerned.
In view of the fact that the financial services and internal market directives, together with the relevant institutions, play a key role in the funding of the European economy and the operation of capital markets, we have tried, in this highly charged situation, to follow the path laid down in Lisbon and to bring about not only competition but also a corresponding degree of social security.
We also had the task of structuring occupational pension schemes as the second pillar of retirement provision and of dealing with the social aspects of this.
This directive is a success for the European Parliament.
We amended the Commission proposal at first reading.
At second reading, we shall amend the common position along lines that reflect our own thinking.
This directive is not the end product.
It is a first step.
I believe that the directive will be of benefit to people because there will be more suppliers in competition with one another; that, with the creation of the European market, it will have more advantages for people on the move; that it will have more advantages for citizens and suppliers because the second pillar too will now be regulated on a European basis; and that it will benefit the capital market by moving sums to the tune of EUR 2 000 billion around the market and hopefully increasing that capital.
The directive will be of benefit to the internal market due to the provision of venture capital, and it will be of benefit to the institutions because European regulations will exist, so making cross-border activities easier.
We have made amendments to six items as a matter of priority.
The amount of information to be given to recipients of pensions has been increased.
The biometric risks have been clearly formulated, and it has been made possible to cover these.
It has been clearly specified that our objective is life-long pensions, which must be at the heart of our arrangements.
The directive will lead to coordination of the work of the supervisory authorities, and it has laid the foundations for a level playing field.
It has still not liberalised the assessment stipulations.
Given the Council's position, that was not possible.
Nor has the directive clarified the issue of tax harmonisation, and it has still not fulfilled our desire to see the second pillar structured in the same way throughout Europe, so providing for greater social security.
The directive is an important step in the right direction, however.
I believe we have maintained the balance within the framework of our competences and the existing options.
I should like most sincerely to thank all those who have contributed to the work.
Mr President, the Commission would like to thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur.
The rapporteur has been so kind as to thank my cabinet and my services.
I am duly grateful for those compliments and shall certainly pass them on to my staff.
I thank the rapporteur and the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs Randzio-Plath, for their judicious and efficient handling of this important file and for their very constructive and cooperative attitude during this second reading.
This directive is of particular strategic importance, not just for our capital markets, but also for our labour markets and perhaps, more importantly, for the sustainability of our public finances and our pension systems as a whole.
This directive has clearly been identified as a priority by Heads of State and Government, notably at the Barcelona European Council.
The current situation in Europe is characterised by three aspects: first, a growing general awareness of what I would describe as the 'demographic timebomb'; second, a clear determination by all Member States to address the financial challenges without undermining the social objective of their pension systems; third, a strong desire by the Member States to preserve the specificity of the pension systems in their efforts to modernise them.
After all, the responsibility for designing and managing pension systems remains with the Member States and there is no intention of changing that.
It is against that background that our efforts to create an internal market framework for the institutions offering occupational pensions must be considered.
A directive aimed at creating a prudential framework for pension funds must fit in with this process of steady but gradual and coordinated reform of national pension systems.
This directive must also - and this has been of fundamental importance for the Commission - fully respect two essential principles: first, full respect for the very wide diversity of the occupational retirement business among Member States and, second, non-interference in the organisation of Member States' pensions systems.
I am very pleased to note that the package of compromise amendments tabled by the PPE-DE, Socialist and Liberal groups fully complies with those two principles.
Mr President, I would like to pay tribute to our rapporteur, Mr Karas, who has shown superb judgement in reaching a broadly acceptable balance in this complex but vitally important directive.
Our group was very concerned at any possibility of the directive failing for lack of consensus in Parliament or between Parliament and the Council.
But the rapporteur has very successfully squared this very difficult circle.
We in the PPE-DE Group are very pleased to support the compromise which the rapporteur and the Commissioner have engineered.
I should, however, flag up some residual concerns which we still have.
For example, compromise Amendments 4 and 12 give Member States the right to provide an option for coverage of biometric risks.
Certainly this is only an option, but we are concerned that differences between Member States might in any way impede cross-border occupational pension funds and the ability to transfer employees together with their pension funds around the European Union.
I would appreciate the Commissioner's reassurance as to his understanding of the impact - or hopefully non-impact - of this option.
The other concern regards the requirement for a register which also has to show in which Member States the institution concerned is operating.
The rapporteur has assured me that, under the agreed amendment, no such register would be required if instead the institutions were 'authorised'.
Again I would appreciate the Commissioner's specific assurance that this is also his understanding.
This would certainly be welcome to the financial services industry with a view to eliminating unnecessary red tape.
Apart from these two matters, we are very pleased with the outcome which provides ample flexibility in, for example, how pension benefits are paid out.
The lump sum payment will continue to be permitted.
We are taking a major step forward in providing a Europe-wide single market in financial services.
Mr Karas and Commissioner Bolkestein are to be congratulated for this achievement.
Tomorrow we must ensure a resounding vote of support for this directive.
Mr President, since everyone has been so polite in thanking one another, I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karas, who has certainly made efforts in the first, and now also in the second, reading to reach a compromise in the committee and in plenary.
I would also back this compromise that has been reached if, under the leadership either of the rapporteur or of a delegation from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it were to be introduced into plenary immediately following negotiations with the Commission.
In those circumstances, I would support it.
A submitted compromise, or a wording presented by the Commission, has a history to it, however, and such compromises or wordings seem to me to be matters of dispute within the ECOFIN Council where, according to what I have been told, one or other of the Member States was, in the end, quite prepared to use another veto.
From the time of the Green Paper up until now when the second reading is imminent, the directive has had several names. The name of the directive really does not matter now, however.
What matters, rather, is the content. Allow me therefore again to extract a couple of items from one of the Commission's or, as the case may be, Commissioner Bolkestein's proposals, for example from the proposal, as they put it, in expectation of reaching retirement age, which legitimises also those payments made before arrival at retirement age.
What this has to do with pension payments, you will first need to explain to me again.
When it comes to the biometric risks, there is clearly no European solution, particularly not in terms of guaranteeing the amounts paid in.
That means that the entire capital market risk has been transferred to the policyholders, which is to say to the employees, and that is something I am unable to accept.
There is no justification for saying, as has already been implied once here in Parliament, 'Give me your money; trust me; I shall invest it and, if it disappears, that is your bad luck'.
I am particularly perturbed by the fact that, in the compromise proposal, the Commission has removed the policyholders' obligation, upon request, to provide information about their current pension rights.
I do not think that what we have here is a good compromise, and I should have liked us to have had the opportunity of a conciliation procedure with a view to arriving in the end at a sensible European regulation.
Mr President, I too should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Karas, and the Commissioner and his staff for what I believe is a very good compromise reached between the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission, which will allow millions of Europeans to accumulate better pension rights wherever they work in the Union.
This is an essential plank of the Financial Services Action Plan.
It will cut the administrative costs of many multinational companies' pension funds, allowing people to have better pensions when they retire.
It will help millions of European old people to retire in the sun.
At present, European citizens are effectively being denied their right to free movement during their working lives and during retirement because of the patchwork of national pension systems.
These impose unacceptable barriers when people seek to change jobs or residence.
This is a big step forward in dealing with them.
We look forward to more progress, particularly on some of the tax issues.
Companies also suffer from a less mobile workforce and the additional bureaucracy, administration and costs involved in managing multiple pensions systems.
Firms with a presence in all fifteen Member States face an estimated EUR 40 million a year in extra costs through having to deal with fifteen different pension providers and legal arrangements.
This agreement also provides more choice of pension funds because it opens up the European market in investment management and pension administration.
In future, we can have a genuine pension savings market of 377 million people, expanding after enlargement to 450 million people.
This is a vast potential market.
Funded occupational retirement schemes in the EU cover 25% of the EU workforce and are currently valued at more than EUR 2 500 billion.
They are expected to grow to more than EUR 7 000 billion by 2010.
This is a key plank in the opening up of the financial services market.
It is also a market-opening measure without using sledgehammers to crack nuts.
It gives a passport to pension funds to operate throughout the EU without trying to harmonise everything.
Member States are responsible for determining the social requirements - such as death in service benefits - for their own pension funds and the tax reliefs that they give, consistent with subsidiarity.
For example, I am pleased that lump sums are specifically allowed.
In addition, the directive means that pension funds can now invest, taking into account their own beneficiaries' requirements rather than arbitrary rules set down by governments for the purchase of their own bonds and so forth.
This insistence on the so-called 'prudent person rule' - the rule that investments are decided prudently - will open up the fund management market.
Overall this is an excellent measure.
I commend it to the House.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe a directive on supplementary retirement provision businesses should have been established to provide a degree of social protection. The European Union does not have such a mandate however.
Consequently, this report forms part of the work towards the objective of creating an internal market for financial services.
This is absolutely clear. Above all, this report will allow supplementary retirement provision institutions in Britain and elsewhere to benefit from their position and offer cross-border services.
We voted against this report at the first reading at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The document certainly sought to correct the shortcomings concerning social obligations but it made investment risks worse.
The common position of the Council better safeguards the prudential requirements for investment, but it does not meet Parliament's demands on social issues.
We have called for this common position to be rejected.
We think that this report must be reconsidered in the context of the serious crisis affecting the stock markets at present. This is affecting pension funds.
It poses a risk to the level of benefits and is causing contributions to be increased. Confidence in these pension fund systems will not be restored without strict management rules and mutual insurance structures for the guarantees.
It is also necessary for these structures to be covered by European collective conventions between social partners.
I would like to say that Mr Karas has worked very hard on this report and has ensured that the text is balanced.
At the end of the day, however, we believe the amendments have a limited scope. This is down to the agreements between the different components of the political groups and what the Council deems to be acceptable to avoid conciliation.
The report is an improvement on the common position, and the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance strengthens the prudential requirements for investment. Nevertheless, the fundamental and essential slant of the text remains.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will vote in favour of the proposal of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left calling for the common position to be rejected.
We are not supporting this proposal because we wish to oppose the financing of supplementary pensions through accumulation of capital on principle. As Mr Kuckelkorn said, a pension is a pension.
It is not a form of saving. Pensions are for life.
They provide for workers when they retire. They also offer certain guarantees in case of incapacity.
Reversion pensions provide for surviving spouses.
Pensions are not financial products. It is quite possible that certain financial products and financial institutions may contribute to the management of certain pension schemes.
Beyond this, however, we would be embarking on the search to establish European definitions of pension products and social mechanisms for the first time. We also need to consider in what circumstances financial institutions can make a contribution.
At present, we are just dressing up savings products in a very ill-defined way. I would like to thank Mr Karas for all the efforts he has made to make this dressing-up as convincing as possible.
Savings products have been dressed up to resemble pensions.
With Mr Karas' amendments, they were already far from being pensions. The compromise amendments, however, have made everything quite clear.
They are purely and simply savings products and should be treated as such. It would amount to a violation of trading regulations to sell them as pensions.
First of all I should like to thank Mr Karas for his report.
It has been no easy task to reach a compromise on such a complex issue as the supervision of occupational retirement provision.
I can support the compromise reached in principle, although it is a weaker proposal than I would like to have seen.
I have submitted three amendments on behalf of the EDD Group, but also at the request of a number of fellow Members from other groups.
I would like greater clarity from Commissioner Bolkestein on this.
Is the European Commission prepared to promise that it will take account of the matters referred to in the amendments in the implementation phase of the directive?
What promises can you make with regard to the subject of the annual reports and associated administrative burdens, as stated in the amendment to Articles 10 and 11?
A second question concerns the amendment to Article 18, Paragraph 2.
Are you prepared to review the absolute prohibition of loans and to give Member States the option of prohibiting them if so desired?
In Recital 8 there is after all clear reference to the principle of subsidiarity.
This recital is not in my view consistent with the prohibition provision in Article 18.
If I receive a satisfactory answer to my questions, I will be prepared to reconsider my amendment.
Finally, let me comment on the Dutch translation of the revised Amendment No 32, in which the words 'or has a licence' have been omitted in error.
The English text contains the words 'or authorised' and I think that this is what must appear in the Dutch text too.
Mr President, I would like to join in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Karas, which I think is only fair.
I have been a privileged witness of the ferocity of the bulls he has had to fight: the Council - which is very divided - the Commission, the other groups in this House and in particular my own group, which has given him more headaches than all the other groups together.
Secondly, I would like to stress the generosity of the European Parliament.
It is true that we have managed to have many of the amendments we presented at first reading accepted, but it is also the case that we have sacrificed legitimate, well-founded and well-argued aspirations in order to achieve a text which can be accepted by the Council.
We have sacrificed these positions, however, because we have always been aware that this directive was essential, at least for three reasons.
Firstly, to make the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty more effective and more real, particularly the mobility of workers.
Secondly, in order to supplement the public social security systems at a time - as has been said - when the challenge we must face in the coming years is a demographic one, the ageing of the population and the sustainability of public finances.
These professional systems of a supplementary nature - I would insist on this aspect - will serve to maintain the future incomes of workers.
This is a social approach which my group applauds.
And, thirdly, because it will help to increase European saving, to increase the depth of the European financial market, which is the global objective of the financial services action plan.
That saving will allow us to fund - and this ties in with what I said in the previous report - the investments we need in order to grow, in order to increase our employment and our productivity.
Mr Karas has highlighted many of the amendments which have enriched the original text of the Commission and the Council.
I would like to stress the increase in transparency due to the information obligations required of the providers of these services, of the people who provide and guarantee these pensions, both with regard to the authorities and the participants.
Secondly, and contrary to what somebody said from the benches of the left, because it incorporates social orientations which are very dear to those of us who advocate a social market economy.
And thirdly because it increases the coordination of the supervision authorities and promotes the possibility of cross-border activities.
I would like to end, Commissioner, by stressing some of the deficiencies pointed out by the rapporteur.
It will be necessary to make progress on tax harmonisation - I pointed this out in the previous report - if we want these cross-border activities to genuinely be expanded and freedom of choice to be real.
Mr President, the vast majority of the Group of the Party of European Socialists will vote for the package of amendments negotiated with the Council and the Commission by Mr Karas. I would like to thank Mr Karas for all his work.
The result of the second reading will probably be acceptable overall.
We are going to create a European passport for pension funds.
We are dealing with a financial instrument but one that has social objectives. Some improvements are therefore necessary in relation to the Council's positions.
We need to guarantee European citizens decent pensions.
Pension funds will have a role to play in this respect, especially if there is also biometric coverage for contributions, or protection against the hazards of life.
To present pension funds as a panacea however would be a deliberate lie.
The press is today referring to a message from the European Financial Services Round Table to the Ecofin Council. It presents pension funds as a miracle solution to the problems of financing pensions in Europe in future.
According to this association of large employers, it will no longer be possible to finance the first pillar of the pensions system, which involves redistribution, as there is an increasing number of recipients and a decreasing number of contributors.
Pension funds that are based on the accumulation of capital, however, will experience exactly the same demographic problems once they reach maturity.
In fact, pensions paid in any given year always involve transferring funds from working people to retired people, whether by redistribution or the accumulation of capital.
Since the bursting of the speculative bubble, most pension funds have shown negative yields. In the United States, pension funds provided by large companies are having to face up to a deficit of more than USD 300 billion.
In Great Britain, the company pension funds deficit was estimated at between GBP 65 and 130 billion at the end of 2002.
There are also significant deficits in Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and elsewhere.
Even the modest pension funds for Members of the European Parliament have just amended contributions by three points.
This type of exercise would also save all redistribution funds. Due to negative financial yields, companies with pension funds no longer have a guaranteed benefit system but a guaranteed contribution system.
In a guaranteed benefit system, contributors save money which they will receive in their retirement. In a guaranteed contribution system, people know how much they are contributing, but receive no guarantee of the result of fund managers' investment policy.
It also goes without saying that fund managers always take their cut of the funds, however the fund is doing.
This explains why the financial sector welcomes the directive so warmly.
Once again, the Group of the Party of European Socialists are not opposing the second and third pillar pension funds. We do, however, think that we need to act very prudently and that very strict prudential requirements are necessary.
Mr President, pensions based on the accumulation of capital should not undermine national pension systems based on solidarity across the generations.
Mr President, it is true that first-pillar pension funds are more sensitive to demographic change and that second-pillar pension funds are more sensitive to changes in the conditions prevailing on the stock market and in the financial markets.
That is of course clear, and so it is also right that we have two pension systems alongside one another, counterbalanced by the third-pillar system.
Meeting our requirements as it does, though, this directive is extremely important.
I am also very pleased with this compromise.
In particular if you work cross-border - and more and more companies are no longer national companies, but have actually become European companies - there is an absolute need for this matter to be dealt with; you can actually describe this as a sort of constitution for occupational retirement provision in Europe.
It is quite clear that not everything is regulated.
Some speakers have been addressing just one point, that we should do nothing social at all any more and that Member States should actually submit to the system that applies in the country that does least.
Fortunately, that is not the case in this compromise, or, for that matter, in the proposals beforehand, which is why I think that the compromise on biometric risks is very fortunate.
In my country it has up to now been customary to insure biometric risks.
If someone from Great Britain suddenly appears on the market and does not insure any biometric risks and makes no mention of that and only talks of pots of gold, as appears to happen in the United Kingdom, then it could be that people quite mistakenly make inadequate retirement provision.
It must be possible to prevent things of this kind and so that is why the compromise is exceptionally good.
With regard to the provision of information, there has been criticism of the fact that we have gained less than we originally sought.
That is certainly true.
It is perhaps a pity, but I believe that it is nonetheless a very significant advance that we are bringing about in this area certain common European standards rather than standards that are intrinsically American.
Finally, Mr President, the tax issue.
This we have of course left aside, as is, I think, far and away the best thing to do in political terms.
I believe that with its announcement the Commission has acted correctly, that is by examining the extent to which the present taxes are not discriminatory.
We have recently had the Danner ruling.
That is one of those rulings that lead to Member States thinking twice before taking discriminatory tax measures against pension funds that happen not to be established in their own country.
While we still have a long way to go, I think that all in all we have certainly made a start.
If we were to reject this compromise, then we will not even have a start and then I believe we will not be doing any good as regards the social objectives that are there as well.
The course of events surrounding this matter for codecision does not, in my view, deserve any beauty prize, but I can nevertheless agree with the compromise that has been achieved at the last moment and to which the Council has already given its approval.
It shows that the Council and the Commission were in any event prepared to take Parliament seriously as a co-legislator.
As far as the content is concerned, I am no great enthusiast either, but with the compromise proposals we are in any event certainly giving a sharper outline to the definition of the funds that fall under this directive and that are now acquiring a European passport to invest and to offer their services across borders.
In a European context, however, a far more profound discussion is needed about the content and the quality of second-pillar pension schemes.
At the end of next week, at the European spring summit, a good start can be made on this not only by sharing information informally, but also by agreeing to reach a consensus on content and convergence of policy.
If you want to propagate the second-pillar, fully-funded pensions, you also have to lead the discussion about the structure and the quality of these schemes.
In the Netherlands roughly half of the income of pensioners is provided by fully-funded second-pillar schemes agreed by social partners - in the future even more of it will be.
You cannot simply deal with them as if they were financial market products, which invest in the capital market and which have to find their way in the internal market as commercial services.
No, the second pillar in the Netherlands expressly belongs with the first pillar, with the social security schemes and must not be lumped together with the individual third-pillar products for those who can afford them.
That is a subject for social policy.
That was also always on the agenda in the discussion and that should also therefore be developed further by way of the spring summit and those discussions about open coordination.
I do however think that there is also more to do on the subject of internal market policy, because I do not agree with what a number of speakers have said, that is that this directive does not do so much to improve the mobility of employees and the opportunity to take pensions with you in the context of the free movement of employees.
On this point far more must happen, not only fiscally, but also where the portability of pensions is concerned.
Here too I would like to see a rather more ambitious approach from the Commission that finds its conclusion in legislation.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, to start with, I wish to thank all the parties concerned for their excellent levels of cooperation in achieving what is a constructive solution.
Commissioner Bolkestein and those officials reporting to him, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Othmar Karas, have done a magnificent job in particular.
In addition, I would like to say to my friend, Othmar, that the Republic of Austria has reportedly overcome the difficult challenges of its history through a remarkable ability to establish consensus and find solutions to benefit all parties.
I think with the work he has done with regard to this directive Othmar has shown he has the important qualities needed by someone who is influential in society.
Ensuring the existence of retirement provision will be one of the main political challenges of the EU Member States in the years to come.
To address this challenge, however, we have a difficult message for the people of Europe.
We must work for a longer period of time but at the same time the pension we receive from statutory occupational retirement schemes will be smaller than before.
It will certainly sound like a kamikaze mission to any politician but it is nonetheless inevitable.
The status quo is not an option.
Although the Member States have the main responsibility for retirement provision we at Union level can implement measures to help promote retirement schemes by creating a sustainable basis for financing them.
This directive on the activities of institutions for occupational retirement provision will create a legislative framework for Europe-wide action and will be one of the measures needed to defuse the pensions bomb.
The directive will encourage the development of retirement schemes that are financially durable, provide companies with the capital they need through investment, and meet the needs of individuals that vary from one to another more effectively than statutory systems do.
This will be especially true on the day we make headway with decisions on taxation.
The directive will, on the one hand, promote the development of European financial markets and, on the other, benefit employees, who will profit from a more efficient and more transparent investment policy regarding their pensions.
It took 15 years to establish common EU laws.
The EU citizen has long been able to benefit from local social and health services in another Member State.
Furthermore, there has been common legislation in existence now for years applying to institutions providing personal pension insurance.
The differing views among Member States on this subject, however - something we are discussing today - held up for too long this directive, which hopefully we will adopt in tomorrow's plenary debate.
The directive now leaves the social partners in the Member States with a free hand to choose how to organise comprehensive voluntary retirement provision.
This is a reasonable European compromise considering the differences that exist among pension systems in the Member States.
Our negotiations were at times both very intensive and intense, but I believe that we will be satisfied with the end result.
The most important thing was that we avoided possibly having to resort to the conciliation procedure.
Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, the Commission and the presidency on producing a package of compromises.
It has been an issue of compromise all the way through.
I understand all the hard work that has been put into it, but let us say straight away that many people have been involved, inside and outside this Chamber, perhaps more than we know.
However, the people who have not been involved - as is so often the case - are the people most likely to benefit or suffer from our decisions.
Compromise was very necessary.
This is not a directive aimed at replacing the first pillar social security-type pension provision.
In the UK, for example, people aged 16 have recently been outnumbered by people aged 60.
Throughout the European Union this must leave no doubt in anybody's mind that we have an ageing society, one that will gradually cost more and must be adequately provided for so as to avoid future pensioner poverty, a very real risk.
The problem is that many people, even today, do not feel obliged or encouraged to save for their retirement.
Many companies are hamstrung by administrative and legal costs prohibiting the promotion of such funds across the European Union.
That is a statement of fact.
Even though this directive delivers a balanced view, taking into account the various factors affecting Member States, it is clear that the cross-border approach to supplementary pensions needs more in the way of liberalising articles.
I hope that we will come back to this discussion at a later date.
Some companies in my country which believe that they can pull out of defined benefit schemes have even looked to this particular directive as an excuse, but Brussels gives no such excuse to those companies.
Lump sum payments have been dealt with in a way that pensioners in many countries will feel is a reflection of what already occurs.
That is an important minimum.
It is clear that the changes we have introduced on transparency and registration are improvements that everyone in this House can live with.
Mr President, Mr Karas deserves our admiration.
My Spanish colleague Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil talked in terms of Mr Karas's winning a bullfight, and that makes me angry with him, as I do not like bullfights.
Moreover, he was the first and only MEP to talk about the greying of the population.
If he had told me that I am an old lady - perhaps on the model of the one whose visit proves so dangerous in DÃŒrrenmatt's famous play - I would not have minded one bit. What I am not at all keen on is being called grey.
What do old people want?
Security, independence and autonomy.
It is just that all this is very difficult to achieve in the framework of occupational retirement provision that is only offered on a time-limited basis.
Even a one-off payment - however generous it might be - does not provide security.
Lifelong payments do most justice to the wishes and also to the needs of old people, corresponding to what we understand to mean by social security.

It is to Mr Karas's credit that he has clarified this very important idea and embedded it in the report, and I should like to thank him for his efforts.
Throughout Europe, we are in the process of discussing and solving the problems of a society in which people at long last ought to be living longer. With a whole package of measures for older employees, the freshly elected Austrian Federal Government has devised a range of options for giving older people the opportunity of being able to work longer.
I say 'of being able to', please note. A reduction in incidental labour costs for those aged over 58, a push for higher qualifications and the promotion of part-time work for older people are just a few of these measures.
Mrs Lulling will certainly agree with me when I say that this society and this Parliament need us.
Anyone who, like myself, has six grandchildren can no longer just relinquish this society of ours to other people. We ourselves have to take care of it.
We oldies are not of course in the end fighting for ourselves, since we obviously already have an income. Rather, we are fighting for the young men and women whom we wish to see have much longer lives.
A child born today may live until the age of a hundred, and we wish him or her an extremely long and, as far as possible, secure life.
Mr President, politics makes a qualitative difference when it is able to counter negative trends and uncertainties with positive measures, and surely no such difference is being made through the way in which the second pillar of the pension system is being structured, even when, as here, we are concerned with a financial services directive.
In spite of his best efforts, the rapporteur has not succeeded in improving the common position, which really does not add anything in terms of quality.
Devising a framework within which products are offered that, from today's point of view, may seriously impair living standards in old age has nothing to do with a sense of political responsibility.
What is really needed here are regulations to reduce people's uncertainties at precisely the present time.
In recent years, British pension funds alone have lost 35 million pounds, and rather more still in the years before that, so they too have not exactly excelled.
Nor have matters gone significantly better for the other Member States.
At a period such as this, people ought not, where the issue of pensions is concerned, to be led to expect quality when it is not present.
Quality regulation of the European market is certainly not brought about by a minimal duty to provide information, together with what is no more than discretionary wording enabling the Member States to define quality for a restricted market with reference to biometric risks.
If - as you yourself always do, Commissioner - we want to see such quality or an increase in quality, then we can, at this stage, really make no better start than by agreeing to the proposal by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to reject the common position.
That alone would signify 'back to square one' and, for us, new opportunities of obtaining an improved directive.
Mr President, I welcome the fact that, following years of tough negotiations between the Commission, the Council and Parliament - and thanks to our rapporteur, who has been indefatigable in his search for compromises - approval of this pensions directive is now within reach.
The Council has given an assurance that it is able to agree to the package before us.
That is crucial, because only in that way can a lengthy conciliation procedure be avoided which, for everyone concerned - employees, employers and financial service providers - might have the kind of damaging effect that this long overdue European regulation might have again postponed.
I could have lived with the common position because the directive concerned is of course designed primarily to regulate, without barriers to competition, the cross-border activities of pension fund providers, and not the product itself.
It was essential to devise a directive that, on the one hand, did not, from the outset, force these financial service providers into a suffocating straightjacket of regulations, for example governing investment policy; and that, on the other hand, organised supervision in such a way that the benefits paid to policyholders were secured in the best way possible.
I believe we have to some degree succeeded in doing this.
It is not our task here to prescribe what kind of supplementary pensions are to be provided and for what sums.
Naturally, the directive can be made to reflect a pious desire for the arrangements concerning occupational retirement provision also to cover the famous biometric risks such as disablement, widow's and orphan's pensions etc. It should, however, be left to companies and their employees to determine what they wish to cover that is not already covered by the public social security system - in other words, the first pillar - in the full knowledge that higher and diversified benefit entitlements naturally have their price.
Naturally, it should also be possible - as, by the way, it is in the case of MEPs' pension fund - for capital to be paid out as a lump sum at retirement age, without its being prescribed what, specifically, the capital is to be used for.
If, when I am old, I want to use the money concerned to fulfil a life-long dream, such as going on a long journey around the world, I should be able to use the money for that purpose.
I must of course be certain that I do not then have to become a burden on the state.
I am sorry that we were unable to bring to fruition a concern, to which I and other MEPs had committed ourselves, that financial institutions in addition to pension funds and insurance companies should be able to offer their services in the field of occupational pensions insurance.
That would have led to a level playing field and so to greater competition.
The package does, however, oblige the EU Commission to examine how matters stand in the market for occupational retirement provision in order to make it possible for other financial services providers too to come within the scope of this directive.
That being said, this directive has done nothing to bring about a common market in supplementary pensions.
We definitely need a regulation to prevent the double taxation of premiums and benefits, and I hope that we shall have the considerable judgment required in order to devise a sensible regulation quickly.
Mr President, I hope it is not a disappointment to Mrs Lulling that the Commission has the last word.
I welcome the fact that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament agree on the compromise text, which may not satisfy everyone.
At least it is an agreed text.
That is what we need on this most important subject.
Parliament is entitled to hear what the Commission thinks about the various amendments, but before doing that I should like to say something to three Members who have spoken.
First, the issue of taxation referred to by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, Mr Pronk and Mrs Lulling.
The follow-up to the pension taxation communication of April 2001 has developed along two tracks.
There has been a discussion process in the Council concerning the Commission's suggestions to improve the exchange of information on cross-border pensions and to deal with double taxation and double non-taxation.
The process did not, I am sorry to say, lead to tangible results.
A number of Member States could only accept any sort of agreement if the issue of residence taxation of pension payouts versus source taxation was also tackled.
On that issue Member States remained deeply split.
Secondly, the Commission has been examining whether or not the national taxation rules on the deductibility of pension contributions are compatible with EU law.
Here the Commission kept its promises to take action.
Last month the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Denmark and five letters of formal notice to Belgium, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal.
In all those Member States pension contributions paid to foreign funds are not tax-deductible, while contributions paid to domestic funds are.
That is a clear case of discrimination.
The Commission is convinced that Community law prohibits such a difference in treatment.
I can assure Parliament that these infringement cases are a priority for the Commission, which will do whatever is necessary to open up the markets effectively for cross-border pension provisions.
To Mr Blokland I say that, according to my information, the amendments which he has put forward have not been accepted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and therefore do not - it seems to me - form part of the discussion tonight.
Therefore the Commission has no opinion on them.
To Mr Purvis I say that this directive is based on two principles: first, the principle of compliance with prudential requirements of the home Member States and second, compliance with the social and labour legislation of the host Member States, i.e. where the company is established.
That includes provisions on biometric risks, but that should not be an obstacle to cross-border activity.
Once again, the compromise arrived at means that there will be no conciliation.
That is a good thing.
One never knows where conciliation might lead.
Personally, I have very vivid memories of conciliation from the takeover directive and am very anxious not to repeat that experience.
Let me turn to the amendments submitted to the vote.
I am please to say that the Commission can accept Amendments 1, 5, 13, 15, 22 and the package of amendments 25 to 37.
The commission cannot accept the other amendments, which for the most part aim at widening the scope of the directive.
The directive does not intend to interfere in the way Member States organise their pension systems.
It considers that the directive should not regulate in a restrictive way the products offered by pension funds.
Nor should it define the precise arrangements for the payment of benefits.
The directive must also respect the diversity of occupational pension systems while setting some strict standards to ensure their mutual recognition, but without imposing unnecessary costs for pension funds.
That is why the Commission rejects Amendments 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 18.
The directive should not experiment by allowing for the possibility of extending the scope of this directive to institutions that today do not offer occupational pension products.
Institutions that already benefit from a single market framework should not be covered by this directive, with the exception of life insurance companies, for which Member States must retain the option to apply this directive for activities linked to pension provisions.
That is why the Commission cannot accept, regrettably, Amendments 2, 6, 8, 10 and 17.
The directive must make full reference to an effective system to ensure efficient exchange of information between competent authorities and promote consistent enforcement of the directive, but that must be done without prejudice to possible future structures.
That is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 7, 19, 20, 21 and 23.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 24 tabled by the Group of the Greens and the European Free Alliance since it considers that pension funds, as very long-term investors with low liquidity risks, should not be overly restricted in their investment in non-liquid assets such as shares.
The Commission cannot accept the motion for rejection of the common position, since it considers the common position to be a finely balanced compromise and recommends its adoption to the European Parliament.
I should like to thank all colleagues for their attendance tonight.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
The common position adopted by the Council forms part of the aim of applying the private capitalisation approach to the financial resources of national pensions systems, in other words, submitting these enormous financial volumes to the methods of the capital markets and enabling the financial sector to speculate on them.
Creating a single market for occupational pensions was one of the priorities of the 'Lisbon strategy', under the Financial Services Action Plan, which seeks to achieve the integration or liberalisation of capital markets in the European Union.
The objectives of private capitalisation are clearly demonstrated in the lack of genuine prudential rules, in the liberalisation of investments and service provision at European level and in the absence of guarantees covering all risks, or allowing them only on an optional basis.
The rapporteur himself, in his explanatory statement, sets the tone, by stating that this proposal will contribute to the development of the financial markets, acknowledging that the common position lacks balance between taking into account the social security of the beneficiaries and the aim of creating a simple framework for capital markets.
Hence the adoption of amendments from first reading, which fall considerably short of what we would wish to see and which do not call into question the approach of the original proposal.
This is the raison d'Ãªtre of my political group's proposal, which I supported, for an amendment seeking the rejection of the Council's common position.
Today, in the Hague, delegates from the 89 co-signatory states of the International Criminal Court Treaty - the member nations of the ICC - will gather for a ceremony presided over by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.
The court's 18 judges will be sworn in and the court will be inaugurated today.
It is expected that prime ministers, presidents, and foreign affairs and justice ministers of the member states will attend.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to say in the clearest way that we, in this Parliament, have promoted and defended human rights.
In so doing we have strongly supported the establishment of the International Criminal Court as a vital step forward at global level.
We can be proud, as Members of the European Parliament, that the court will take shape today.
In my opinion, for those who have offended the international human rights order, a body such as the International Criminal Court is better than a Guantanamo Bay.
The House will recall that we have already adopted resolutions in this regard on a number of occasions, including as recently as last October.
- (DA) The June Movement abstained from voting in the vote on Amendment No 8, tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to item 12 concerning the place to be given to European political parties in the budget.
That is because we are fundamentally opposed to the financing of European parties by the EU.
We do not therefore wish to get involved in the technical elaboration of such a system.
Iraq
The next item is the Council and the Commission statement on Iraq.
(A number of Members raise banners with peace slogans)
Would the Members be so kind as to remove the banners and sit down so that we can listen to the Council's statement.
The honourable Members are well aware of the Rules of Procedure.
Please sit down and remove the banners.
(The Members complied with the President's instructions)
The President-in-Office of the Council, the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Papandreou, has the floor.
May I point out in response to the peace demonstration, Mr President, that following decisions taken by the summit Council and the Council of Foreign Ministers on 27 January, the Greek Presidency has instructions to exhaust every means of finding a peaceful and diplomatic solution to the Iraqi problem.
Iraq is a matter of concern to us on a number of counts.
I should first like to bring you up to date on the question of Iraq itself and how things stand, although this does of course impinge on numerous other issues.
Iraq is testing relations and institutions and setting all of us a tough challenge.
First of all, the unity of the European Union of the Fifteen is being tested, as is the unity of the European Union of the twenty-five and the twenty-eight.
Relations between the United States and the European Union, trans-Atlantic relations are being tested. Relations between the European Union and the Arab and Muslim world are being tested.
The countries in the Gulf, which surely have their own specific concerns about how things are developing, are also being tested.
The concept of multilateral diplomacy and, more importantly, the relevance, future and modus operandi of the UN are being tested.
At the same time, new challenges are testing us, such as weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism.
Our approach, how we plan to step up our fight against these new threats, is also being tested.
This is where Europe has a voice.
This is a Union that believes in common values and our approach to current problems is based on these common values.
I should like at this juncture to point out that the European Union, as far as its unity is concerned - and, as the presidency, we have made particular efforts in this direction - has taken two important decisions.
You know what they are.
I should simply like to point out that, at the summit Council on 17 February, we achieved a common stand and made an important joint declaration, in which we stress that the Union's objective is the full disarmament of Iraq and full compliance with Security Council Resolution 1441.
We considered that war was not inevitable and I should like to stress that we still feel the same.
It is for Baghdad to end this crisis by complying with the demands of the Security Council.
The Fifteen fully support the ongoing work of the inspectors and wish to give them the time and resources that the Security Council believes they need.
However, inspections cannot continue indefinitely.
Primary responsibility for dealing with Iraqi disarmament lies with the Security Council.
Naturally, we - the Union - have our views, but it is at the UN that the decisions are taken.
The unity and firmness of the international community, as expressed in the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1441, and the military build-up in the Gulf have been essential in obtaining the return of the inspectors.
Finally, in the wider context of the Union's policy to secure peace, security and cooperation in the Middle East, we stressed that our top priority was to invigorate the peace process in the Middle East and promote, publicise and implement the roadmap.
I should like to point out here that recent developments in Iraq are giving us grave cause for concern.
We have listened carefully to Hans Blix and I can assure you that the Greek Presidency is making an effort to attend all UN procedures and meet all sides in the Iraqi debate.
We are in constant touch with Kofi Annan, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei and, of course, with most, if not all of the members of the Security Council.
We recently had the opportunity to listen to Hans Blix; according to the detailed Unmovic report, Iraq has now started to cooperate.
I refer to the start made on destroying the Al-Samoud missiles and private, untaped interviews with Iraqi scientists.
However, the international community is still waiting for Iraq to comply fully with its disarmament obligations, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, especially Resolution 1441.
We therefore call again on the Iraqi regime to comply immediately with these resolutions.
As far as the challenges facing us are concerned, I should like to highlight the initiatives being taken by the Greek Presidency, in collaboration with the Council secretariat, Mr Solana, the Commission and Mr Patten, and the vital importance we attach to them.
First of all, our relations with the Arab world.
We have taken important initiatives here.
We have visited the Arab world repeatedly over recent weeks.
Mr Patten has been to various countries in the region - Iran, Jordan, Turkey. The presidency has done likewise.
I personally have recently visited the region four times.
I attended the council of foreign ministers of the Arab League and was invited to Sharm el-Sheik by the summit council of the Arab League to talk on behalf of the European Union.
A number of my colleagues in the Council, such as the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to mention just two, have also visited the region on the presidency's behalf.
Our objective is to collaborate with the Arab world; first, in sending a strong message to Iraq that there is hope for a peaceful solution if they comply fully and, secondly, in order to stress that this crisis is not a political clash or a religious clash.
On the contrary, it is a crisis in which we are working with the Arab and Muslim world and this is well appreciated by the Arab world.
Our third objective was to galvanise the Arab world into action, which I think we have succeeded in doing.
An Arab League delegation is due to visit the region with a clear message for Saddam Hussein within the next few days.
A second important area concerns relations between the United States and the European Union.
I think it would be a mistake not to recognise that relations have been particularly strained recently, especially over the question of Iraq.
There may previously have been other reasons, such as Kyoto, the International Criminal Court and so on, but the question of Iraq has put relations under a great deal of strain.
I am sure that we all want to maintain a working relationship based on long-standing, joint efforts to achieve security and, of course, on the common values expressed by Europe and the United States; the principles of freedom, democracy and peace.
What we want to highlight, therefore, is the need for a substantive dialogue on the future of security at international level and how we intend to combat these problems.
We have already met both Mr Powell and Mrs Rice and other political figures on the American political scene in a bid to ensure that there is a substantive debate between the European Union and President Bush on these issues at the summit Council in June.
Naturally we are in constant contact with the United States as regards our position on the Iraqi question.
As far as the countries in the region are concerned, we are working closely with Turkey, which has taken the initiative of starting a debate on the problems which the Iraqi crisis may throw up, and is working with neighbouring countries to avert the war and get Saddam Hussein to comply.
This close collaboration is ongoing.
Turkey is a candidate country and we are naturally worried about the possible repercussions of developments in the region, such as the Kurdish question, the question of refugees and economic and political repercussions in general.
So we are also working with them.
As far as multilateral diplomacy is concerned, I think, as I have said, that we have fully supported UN efforts.
The European Union and the Fifteen - or even the Twenty-Eight - have stressed the importance of the role of the UN and I think this will prove to be a key factor in any further decisions we take as an international community.
As the presidency, we too have therefore tried to support every initiative which has originated in the Security Council. Numerous proposals have been tabled, by Canada, by Mexico, by Spain, Britain and America and by France and Germany.
What we are trying to do, of course, because we have a large number of members in the Security Council, is everything we can to foster a joint approach to the problem.
As I said, the Iraqi crisis is throwing up new issues or is perhaps highlighting the problems of the times we live in: how to deal with countries with weapons of mass destruction, how to address the fear that weapons of mass destruction might fall into terrorist hands; I think that, here too, Europe has a vital role to play.
Europe is a community of values.
Europe is experienced in integrating countries that have lived through dictatorships and autocratic regimes, it has shown that it knows how to integrate countries into an area of real democracy and freedom and to contribute to peace on the continent of Europe as a whole.
This invaluable experience can guide us and give us an important base from which to deal with new problems in other regions of the world.
I do not see this experience as a sign of weakness, which is a criticism often levelled at Europe; I see it as a very strong point and I think we should make use of this very strong point to raise a loud, united voice at international level.
The presidency will continue to work in this direction with all its partners, with the Fifteen, as well as the Twenty-Five and the Twenty-Eight and, of course, with the European Parliament.
With these few words I should like to thank you for listening; I am, of course, here to answer any questions you may have.
I should just like to say that I wish I had more time for debate and could spend more time here in the House.
I trust you will understand that, unfortunately, a large part of my life is spent flying from one continent to another, from one region to another, especially on account of Iraq, representing the European Union at these difficult times.
Mr President, I wish to express my gratitude for the professionalism and courtesy of the Foreign Minister of Greece, with whom it is a real pleasure to work.
I say that, having worked now with eight presidencies.
The Minister said that he had spent a good deal of time in the last few weeks at about 30 000 feet.
I can honestly say that I have spent a lot of my time in the last three and a half years at that altitude.
On the whole, when I have not been at that altitude, I have been in this Chamber.
Because of the range of my responsibilities I have probably spent - and enjoyed spending - more time in this Chamber than any other Commissioner.
I think the House will know that I have tried to be pretty brief in my remarks so as not to take up too much debating time.
I hope today that the House will allow me to speak at slightly greater length, because I would like to talk about one or two things about which I feel very strongly.
I hope that I have never knowingly oversold to this House the achievements of the common foreign and security policy - or even its potential under the existing Treaty.
I have always been acutely conscious of its limitations.
Let me quote briefly from a speech I made almost three years ago, in June 2000: 'In the important advances achieved in CFSP in the last decade, the Member States have not given the Commission a sole right of initiative; nor, in general, have they agreed to abide by majority votes; nor do they accept that Europe has 'occupied the space', reducing national freedom of action?
Foreign policy remains primarily a matter for democratically elected Member State governments.'
Despite the brave and extremely professional efforts of the Greek Presidency, that has never been more evident than over the last few miserable weeks, which have also amply illustrated what I went on to say in that speech, namely that: 'All Member States should acknowledge what those actually doing the work of CFSP have long understood - that mere inter-governmentalism is a recipe for weakness and mediocrity,
for a European foreign policy of the lowest common denominator.
That will become more obvious as the Union takes in new members.'
The sorry figure cut by the European Union in recent weeks should not blind us to the real and remarkable achievements of the common foreign and security policy over the last decade, in the Balkans, Afghanistan and many other parts of the world.
But it should also remind us how far we still have to go.
Of course, it is possible, as some have suggested, for a small group of Member States to act as a driving force to give Europe a coherent, high-profile foreign policy.
But without better machinery to harness common political will, they are just as likely to drive an incoherent high-profile policy.
This has not been a good time for those who believe that the way forward for European foreign policy is to leave things to the big Member States.
One lesson we can already draw from the unfolding events - a point made by the Minister - is the importance of developing the role and authority of the United Nations.
It is in the interests of the whole world that power should be constrained by global rules, and used only with international agreement.
What other source of international legitimacy except the UN exists for military intervention?
On what other basis is it possible, indeed, to address the problem of weapons of mass destruction?
I am here thinking not just of the particular case of Iraq, but of the wider issue.
America's refusal to press forward with ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty hardly strengthens the hand of the International Atomic Energy Agency and others seeking to prevent the proliferation of nuclear technology in Iran, North Korea and beyond.
I regretted, too, America's decision to resile so lightly from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
For such decisions - and there have been many - send a dangerous signal about the value that the United States places on international commitments.
That, surely, is a critical battle lost in what some call the 'war against terrorism'.
For I find it hard to conceive how the terrorist threat can be confronted effectively except through international cooperation and disciplines.
(Applause)
Impressive work has already been done within the European Union and through the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee.
We should continue to help countries which find it hard to meet their counter-terrorism obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373.
And we should continue to work for a less unequal world - for example in the WTO Doha Development Agenda, by carrying forward the Monterrey decisions on development financing and by implementing the Johannesburg decisions on sustainable development.
As a general rule, are wars not more likely to recruit terrorists than to deter them?
It is hard to build democracy at the barrel of a gun, when history suggests that it is more usually the product of long internal development within a society.
Because of the UN's unique role as a source of legitimacy, it is of the greatest importance that if a war is waged in Iraq, the UN should authorise the decision to attack.
If, tragically, the position of the United Nations remains ambiguous - for example, if authority for an attack rested solely on Resolution 1441, but without explicit Security Council confirmation that Iraq's failure fully to comply constituted a casus belli - then it is still likely to be desirable that the UN should provide the framework as soon as possible for humanitarian assistance that may be necessary thereafter, that it should oversee the emergence of the new Iraqi polity, driven by the people of Iraq themselves and that it should help to coordinate the international reconstruction effort that will certainly be required.
No-one can seriously dispute, however, that it would be preferable if - a huge 'if' - we were able to disarm Saddam Hussein by inspections.
The European Union is a massive donor in the Balkans and in Afghanistan, and we are already the largest humanitarian donor in Iraq.
If it comes to war, we shall certainly have to step up that help, not just to the victims of the conflict, but to those who may seek refuge from it.
The Commission has been engaged in intensive contacts with UN organisations and with the countries around Iraq about how we might best contribute on the humanitarian front.
EUR 15 million has already been set aside, but we may well need to go much further - drawing, if necessary, on the budget's emergency reserve.
It will be essential that, with other international assistance agencies, the European Union should be free to give independent and impartial help.
A strict separation will need to be maintained between military action and assistance in order to preserve the so-called 'humanitarian space'.
That objective will be much easier to achieve if the UN is recognised, at an early stage, as the lead assistance coordinator.
Immediate humanitarian help is one thing, but the demands upon us will certainly extend much beyond that.
As the House is all too well aware, Europe's external relations budget is already heavily committed.
It will be very difficult in any circumstances to launch massive new programmes in Iraq and in the neighbourhood of Iraq.
But it will be that much more difficult for the European Union to cooperate fully and on a large scale - also in the longer-term reconstruction process - if events unfold without proper UN cover and if the Member States remain divided.
When I have made this point in the past I have sometimes been accused of, as it were, issuing a threat of European Union non-cooperation if the United States chooses to proceed without UN backing, on the principle suggested by the New York Times columnist, Tom Friedman, from the sign in a china shop: 'If you broke it, you own it'.
But that is not my point.
I am simply making an observation of fact: if it comes to war, it will be very much easier to persuade you - the European Union's budgetary authority - to be generous if there is no dispute about the legitimacy of the military action that has taken place; about the new political order that emerges thereafter; or about who is in charge of the reconstruction process.
I am not making a quasi-legal point.
I am simply offering a political judgement of no great novelty or sagacity.
It seems pretty obvious to me.
I am gravely concerned - and I know that many in this House share my concerns - about the potential collateral damage of recent events and of a war, if it comes to that.
Our joint efforts should be directed to trying to minimise those potential effects.
I am thinking not just of the death and destruction that might be wrought by war itself, or of the destabilising consequences for Iraq's immediate neighbours, but of potential damage, for example to the authority of the United Nations, to NATO and to transatlantic relations, which are going through - to put it mildly - a very difficult passage.
In all these contexts we must look beyond the immediate arguments and remind ourselves of our long-term interests to cooperate and to strengthen the flawed but necessary apparatus of international governance.
But there are three other areas, finally, where we should also work to reduce collateral damage from recent events.
The first is the common foreign and security policy itself, which has suffered a severe setback because Member States on both sides of the debate have chosen to take firm national policy positions as if they spoke for the European Union as a whole.
We must not be disheartened by this setback.
There have been similar divisions within the United States, and even within the US Administration, but these do not pull the country apart because in the end the President is empowered to speak for the nation as a whole.
As a Union of independent nations we do not enjoy that luxury.
But that is a reason to redouble our efforts to build an effective CFSP, not to abandon them.
As we return to the work we shall find, perhaps, a little more humility even among the large Member States, which can surely see how much they have damaged their common enterprise and how much they have reduced their common influence as a result of public squabbling.
(Applause)
A second European project that risks being hurt by recent events if we do not work actively to sustain it is the cause of enlargement.
It is particularly damaging that disagreements over Iraq have been allowed to overshadow the debate about enlargement.
We should not call into question the European vocation of countries simply because of their views on the Iraq crisis.
(Applause)
Let us assure the acceding countries that we continue to look forward eagerly to their imminent membership.
But, on the other side of the argument, let us also acknowledge that those who join our Union are making an existential choice.
They are not declaring themselves for Europe and against the United States - emphatically not.
But, in the words of the Treaty on European Union, they are accepting a responsibility to 'refrain from action ? likely to impair [the effectiveness of the Union] as a cohesive force in international relations.'
The present members may have set a very bad example,
(Applause)
but that does not reduce the responsibility on all members, including the acceding states, to meet that Treaty obligation.
Finally, I want to say a word about Israel and Palestine.
What happens if there is a war in Iraq?
Let us suppose, let us pray, that it is brief.
