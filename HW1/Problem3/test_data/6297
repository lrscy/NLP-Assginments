That does happen, but does it also happen in the case of conferences of the international airline organisations, for example?
I would welcome this greatly.
I should like to echo the hope which has been expressed in favour of broad support for this report during tomorrow' s vote.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the discussion.
I am perhaps slightly disappointed by the view of the PPE-DE.
The objectives of the programme which have been raised in this report originate predominantly from the Commission's notification section, but also include many of the same objectives which President of the Commission Romano Prodi raised in his own presentation of sustainable development at the last sitting in Strasbourg.
I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs; in my opinion the work was carried out well.
I would also like to thank you for your observations; I personally aim to start discussions at as early a stage as possible and maintain contact with the various bodies during the work.
I hope that I have succeeded in this.
I also hope that the PPE-DE is able to support this report because I have taken their proposals very broadly into account in proceedings in the committee.
Possibly for this reason, this final proposal now coming for its first reading has become something of a mixture of combined hopes, but Bernd Lange and David Bowe gave a very clear idea of how we can work further on this programme document.
Thank you once again.
Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, thank you for your interventions and, of course, first of all I would like to commend the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, for her excellent work in preparing the report in a very short time.
There were actually two choices after I decided to say 'yes' to the question in the hearing about whether I wanted to present a sixth Environment Action Programme: either the choice of being criticised for being too ambitious and thus unrealistic, or being too detailed and thus not visionary enough.
I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about whether it was a good answer to say 'yes, we should make a sixth Environment Action Programme' since it has been heavily criticised.
On the other hand, I expected that, because there was a global assessment of the fifth programme, and what did it teach us?
We learned from that programme that implementation was not good enough.
We have a solid base of more than 200 legal acts in the environment.
We already have ambitious targets and deadlines in programmes, but they have not all been met.
There is a lack of understanding from different institutions and from Member States in actually wanting to carry out the necessary work for the environment.
This is what we learned.
I wanted to make a short programme: it should have been shorter, but guess what would have happened then?
We would have added, and Parliament and Council would have added a number of details and included even more issues in the environmental programme.
That is always the risk if you want to make a short.
My collaborator said that it was not possible to bring in all the important issues and make the programme shorter.
There is the risk of making it a shopping list, and I wanted to avoid that.
I wanted to make it an action programme.
I wanted to point out what is necessary to mobilise, on a very broad scale, all different stake-holders in society, and to mention the actions necessary to meet the objectives set in this programme to show that, during a period of ten years, these kinds of actions are necessary.
Of course, I am not against targets, timetables or deadlines.
We need them, but they must be based on sound science, on the latest facts from these different sectors and policy areas.
I appreciate that we have broad support for the priorities and the structure of this programme.
We have the problem that this is a codecision procedure, so we have a difference between the first and second part and I do not know how to deal with that.
It is a pity that it exists, because you need to see the full text to understand the way we think about these issues: so that is partly an explanation of the problems we experience.
It has to come in the right order, however: the targets and deadlines should, of course, come in the automatic strategies, in the follow-up.
However, I wanted the programme to describe the priorities and stick to the priorities, not to make it a shopping list, not to add everything about bathing water quality or the noise problem, etc., instead to stick to these priorities.
We have so many good amendments that actually enhance this programme and we welcome those amendments that clarify the text and add some precision to the actions being proposed: I include Amendment No 77 on allowing environmental criteria to be taken into account in public purchasing.
This is what we are working on at the moment.
I appreciate the reference to giving priority to young people in the provision of information, emphasised in Amendment No 88.
We have not been able to say 'yes' to all the excellent amendments about information and education to young people.
We do not have the competence, or the resources - it has to be up to the Member States to carry this out - but it is a very important issue and I want to underline that.
The setting of targets should be seen as part of the process, getting results by involving stake-holders, because we do not have many specific proposals for these targets and timetables.
It was the same in the Council when we asked what kind of targets do you mean?
Give us some examples - I got two, of which one was very general and the other already known to us.
Of course, we could have used concepts such as 'ecological footprint' or 'factor 4' or 'factor 10', but then the programme would have been slightly different.
It must be based on sound science and facts and it must be achievable and viable.
I would like to say something about thematic strategies.
We have proposed the use of thematic strategies for defining the set of measures that will be needed to tackle six complex and multi-dimensional problems.
The Commission fully understands and we strongly support the wish of Parliament to be fully involved and consulted on the content of the thematic strategies.
That has been our objective all the time.
I welcome the inclusion of an Article that defines thematic strategies and I can support the spirit, if not the letter, of Amendment No 66, because a thematic strategy may be a framework directive, but it could also be a combination of a directive and other actions.
We should not specify that in every case there should be a framework directive.
We have to keep it open, to have a strategy which includes the possibility of proposing a framework directive.
There is also this question about timetables and again we must remember that this is a strategic programme that lays down the priorities for the next 10 years, not a comprehensive work programme.
There is no link made between new actions proposed and the resources available to do the job.
The Commission will produce the necessary proposals, but they need to be of good quality and it is also important to underline that.
We cannot accept those amendments that seek to bind the Commission to producing proposals by set dates, for example, Amendments Nos 49, 76, 85, 123, 189, 198.
It is always the Commission's intention to use the mid-term review of the programme as the point at which the implementing measures for the programme should be prepared.
There are annual reports about implementation, but so far we have not made a big case out of these, although we have started to have these name, fame and shame seminars, to do more to make it public, and we warmly welcome Parliament's intention to take part and to know more: we are willing to do everything possible to help in this.
I will not comment on all the amendments, because we have already left a note with our comments, but urban areas need to be stressed more and we welcome the spirit of Amendment No 207.
Of the 297 amendments being proposed, the Commission actually supports more than half in full, or in part, or in principle, but we cannot accept 145.
Finally, we welcome this opinion.
We feel that it will be an invaluable contribution to creating an operational, dynamic and ultimately successful sixth Environment Action Programme.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Environmental impact of certain plans and programmes
The next item is the report (A5-0177/2001) by Mrs SchÃ¶rling, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (C5-0118/01 - 1996/0304(COD)).
. (SV) Mr President, it has been very exciting to be part of the process leading up to the decision we are to take on strategic environmental impact assessments.
The idea behind environmental impact assessments for plans and programmes is an old one.
The original draft directive appeared in the 1970s, at which time it covered policy areas, plans, programmes and projects.
However, the Commission changed its mind and decided to propose a directive which only covered environmental impact assessments for projects.
The next step was not taken until 1991, when the Commission put forward a proposal for a directive on environmental impact statements which took in policy areas, plans and programmes.
However, the proposal was presented at a time of lively debate on the balance of power in what was then the European Community, and the proposal encountered so much opposition that it was withdrawn in 1992.
The Commission did not give up, stating in the Fifth Environment Action Programme that an impact statement for policy areas, plans and programmes is necessary to achieve sustainable development.
This can be seen in the context of the debate held earlier today.
At the same time Member States were urged to expand the Directive on the Assessment of the Effects of Certain Public and Private Projects on the Environment to encompass plans and programmes.
In 1997 the Commission put forward a new, amended proposal which no longer covered policy areas.
This was a shame as the policy areas should naturally have been included.
I tried to reintroduce policy areas into the text, but this amendment unfortunately received no support during the second reading.
I hope it will at least be included some time in the future.
The aim of the directive is to ensure that an environmental impact assessment is carried out on certain plans and programmes and that the result of these impact assessments will be taken into consideration during the planning and approval of plans and programmes which may have an environmental impact.
The fact that the environmental assessment comes early on in the planning process, so that there is time to make adjustments or changes or draw up alternative plans, is naturally an excellent instrument for all decision makers.
The directive must also naturally be seen as a complement to the environmental impact statements on projects, but these come much later in the decision-making process.
Conciliation on this matter started in October 2000 and ended in Strasbourg on 14 March 2001.
Although the negotiations have been tough, I am happy with the end result, which can be summarised as follows.
Parliament has pushed through a requirement for monitoring environmental impact which was not included in the Council Common Position.
This ensures that corrective measures can be taken if the monitoring shows that initiatives are insufficient.
It will also be possible to identify hazardous effects and corrective measures, if possible at an early stage.
A hard battle was also fought on whether Structural Funds, agricultural funds and funds for the applicant countries should be included in the directive.
We eventually obtained political agreement that this would happen and that exceptions currently in force will only apply for the period of the programme, which ends in 2006/2007.
I was not entirely satisfied with this solution.
Therefore, an information note has been included, drawn up by Commission civil servants, which confirms that this will naturally also apply to the EU' s own plans and programmes.
Another important and well-formulated point was that on transboundary consultations with third countries and public consultation.
I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in this work: the Swedish Presidency for its tough negotiations, the Commission for all its expertise and my colleagues who have taken part in the committee and delegation work, as well as everyone else who has taken part in the delegation.
Thank you all.
Mr President, we are essentially satisfied with the agreement reached in conciliation.
All the main demands advanced by Parliament at the two previous readings have been incorporated by the Council.
The obligation to carry out an environmental impact study at an extremely early stage of town and country planning means that environmental issues can actually be integrated fully into land management plans and programmes at the very start of the drafting process.
The Union has finally understood that we must no longer restrict ourselves to dealing with the damage caused by short-sighted planning only after it has been done.
In this connection, extending the scope of the directive to a whole raft of plans and programmes co-financed by the Union represents a great step forwards.
In practice, these represent all the programmes carried out, particularly in the less favoured regions.
Without going into detail, Article 3 of the text that has been approved clearly confirms the principle that all plans and programmes with possible significant effects on the environment are subject to an environmental assessment.
Thanks to the climate of cooperation established within the committee, to which the rapporteur contributed decisively, other important results have also been achieved, such as a more precise definition of what is meant by 'public consultation' and a more specific hierarchical structuring of the various processes, in such a way as to avoid any risk of unnecessary overload for local administrations.
Overall, this is an extremely useful legislative instrument which will obviate the temptation - always present in the Member States, as demonstrated again by the recent statements by future ministers of the Italian government currently being formed - to accelerate the launch of massive infrastructure projects, skipping, at least partly, the processes laid down by Community legislation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today has again proved that the European Union' s environmental policy has in recent years become a key aspect of European policy.
There can be no doubt that the wide-ranging efforts to protect the environment and human health and the careful and rational use of natural resources are necessary and important.
The compromise now arrived at in the Conciliation Committee concerning the assessment of the environmental impact of certain Parliamentary programmes is therefore also an important building block in the European Union' s environmental policy.
I am glad that many of the uncertainties and imponderables from the first and second readings are no longer part of this directive.
I particularly welcome the fact that many terms - and I will only mention the term public again here - are now clearly defined.
The extension of the directive to support out of EU funds, that is to support from the Structural Funds, must certainly be viewed positively by and large.
It should be pointed out here, however, that applications for money from the Structural Funds are already being delayed by bureaucratic hurdles and by what seem to me in some cases to be highly unreasonable demands.
If we are now looking for further conditions to be met for support from the Structural Funds, the necessary second step must be to reduce bureaucracy in other fields.
I would emphatically point out that the impression should not be given here that inclusion of the environmental impact assessment will put support in jeopardy.
Allow me to draw your attention to another weakness. It is doubtful whether the environmental impact assessment referred to in the present text will be applied in a comparable manner in all Member States.
Too often the application and implementation of important rules is left to the discretion of the Member States.
This no doubt satisfies the regionalists in the EU, but it is hardly conducive to achieving comparable situations in the European Union.
There is also the fear that distortions of competition might result.
I see this as the crucial weakness of the compromise arrived at in the Conciliation Committee.
If environmental impact assessments serve only to highlight possible dangers in one country but the same results of the assessment may result in the measures in question being banned in another, we can hardly speak of the arrangement as being appropriate for an internal market.
We should watch and critically examine developments in the next few years and take action accordingly.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad that this directive is now entering its final stage of adoption.
It is indeed an important new instrument that will strengthen the integration of the environmental considerations into decision-making and I particularly welcome the agreement of the Consultation Committee on a joint text confirmed on 21 March.
Some significant improvements have been made from the common position to the final directive, some have entered the directive, such as the introduction of monitoring or the strengthening of provisions on the quality of the environmental report.
This was possible due to the quality of Parliament's proposals and the agreement of the Council to take these on board in the framework of the codecision procedure.
I would like to particularly congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs SchÃ¶rling, as well as all members of the Conciliation Committee.
The international importance of this directive is also shown by the fact that it already serves as an example of an SCA protocol currently being developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
This is proof of the contribution to environmental improvement that the European Community can and should continue to make.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers
The next item is the report (A5-0178/2001) by Mr de Roo, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/23/EEC relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting (C5-0130/2001 - 1997/0348(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, noise is one of the key environmental issues.
It is one of the few environmental problems which is affecting a great number of citizens and which actually falls within their frame of reference.
This was noticed as early on as during the fifth environment action programme, when the Commission promised proposals then, but nearly ten years have passed and not a great deal has been done about it.
Of all noise sources, the noise generated by cars and lorries is the most crucial one.
The noise of cars which exceed 40 to 50 km/hour does not so much originate in the engine as it does from the tyres, and particularly from the contact between the tyres and the road surface.
The Council of Ministers of the Internal Market have neglected the noise aspect enormously.
They hardly considered the environmental aspect at all.
That is why the European Parliament decided at second reading to try to reduce the noise of car tyres by two decibels.
Two decibels may not appear much, but three decibels represents nearly a cut of the noise by half.
The common position was so weak that 70% of the cars already comply with the new noise standards, at least in northern Europe.
The gravity of the negotiations did not move the Council of Ministers a great deal.
Even the compromise on the part of Parliament simply to halve the requested reduction of two decibels down to only one decibel was viewed unfavourably by the Ministers.
We reached a compromise ultimately, however.
In the compromise, we passed the ball back to the Commission, which is now under heavy pressure to prepare more far-reaching proposals on noise production in tyres in future.
Noise-reducing tyres are already available.
They have to become the norm in future, and the EC' s industry must opt for these rather than side with the people lagging behind.
It is also important to review legislation regarding the rolling resistance of tyres.
This could particularly benefit the CO2-problem, also known as the greenhouse problem.
A reduction of five to ten percent is certainly within the realms of possibility.
Here too, we are waiting for the European Commission' s next move.
The Conciliation Committee has finally managed to reach a reasonable compromise, and that is why I recommend the entire European Parliament to back this achieved result.
I should like to make a brief reference to the future.
A hefty noise reduction cannot only be achieved by including noise-reducing tyres in a European standard, but also by using noise-reducing asphalt.
This being the case, the noise generated by road traffic can then be reduced by five decibels.
Even in my own country, the Netherlands, where 40% of the population complain about traffic noise, a pilot project is running, involving noise-reducing asphalt, which produces a reduction by ten decibels.
I hope that in its new proposals, the European Commission will not only consider noise-reducing tyres, but will also look into noise-reducing asphalt, for the noise of traffic is a thorn in the side of an increasing number of people.
Mr President, my favourite Commissioner, when I bought new tyres for my car six months ago I decided to buy tyres with a 71 decibel noise rating.
That is 3 decibels less than we are to adopt for the year 2005 tomorrow.
Mr Commissioner, I am at a loss to explain to anyone why there are already tyres on the market that are 3 decibels below the standard we are to adopt for 2005.
Some say the tyre may be quiet, but it is unsafe and also uses more fuel.
That is not true!
The tyre I bought has a rolling resistance far below the average and it also has grip values and aquaplaning values that are much better than the average.
It is therefore a quiet, low consumption and, at the same time, safe tyre.
It is also advertised on the tyre itself - I think rightly so: reducing CO2.
So more can be done than proposed.
To that extent I find the compromise just about acceptable.
You and the Commission really ought to go and look at what is available on the market.
Then you should put forward as soon as possible a fresh proposal for a further reduction in noise - while maintaining the standard of safety - and I think Parliament will then happily go that way with you.
Thank you, Mr Lange.
I am sure that, like me, many of the honourable Members would be most interested in knowing which brand of tyre you have just described.
I would like to congratulate the European Parliament, the delegation chaired by Mr Provan, and the rapporteur, Mr de Roo, on their success in reaching an agreement with the Council on this directive.
I would like to stress that with this directive, the European Community will set the pace for the industry to produce 'quieter' tyres for the benefit of all European citizens.
This directive is just a first but major step toward significant progress towards better control of road transport nuisance.
Other steps will follow to further improve the protection of the environment and the road safety aspects of tyres.
This will place the European tyre industry at the leading edge of the technology world-wide.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Financial Regulation applicable to the EC general budget
The next item is the report (A5-0176/2001) by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council regulation (EC, ECSC, Euratom) on the financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (COM(2000) 462 - C5-0627/2000 - 2000/0203(CNS)).
Mr President, it is an honour to have ten minutes in which to address such a full House on a report which is, after all, quite important and even quite passionate about the subjects which it raises and which relate to it.
It deals with the financial regulation of the European Union, the reworking of the financial agreement and obviously accompanies the reform proper of our Union and of our Commission, following the resignation of the Commission, following the report by the Wise Men, following the recommendations which the Committee of Wise Men made and which the European Parliament and our relevant parliamentary committees, especially the Committee on Budgetary Control, accepted in good faith.
As you will all recall, the Committee on Budgetary Control made a point of highlighting the importance of the work of the Committee of Wise Men.
One of the most important reforms recommended by the Wise Men and endorsed by the European Parliament and the famous van Hulten report relates first and foremost to a key reform recommended by the financial regulation, that is, that we abolish financial control in its present form, with all its practical difficulties, and introduce an ex post audit, change the formula without changing the system - on the contrary - in order to extend and make controls more efficient, to quote the Wise Men.
So it is in the wake of this recommendation that our committees, both the Committee on Budgetary Control and the Committee on Budgets subscribed to the thinking of the European Commission and this is one of the points which I want to stress because I shall concentrate in the second part of my speech on the proposed amendments which appear to me to have no bearing whatsoever on the subject.
In the five minutes available to me, as rapporteur, in which to present my report, I wish to address the reform by saying that we have taken a very close look at your proposal, Commissioner, and have proposed 260 amendments, proof positive that we have done a proper job.
The two Hughes procedure committees with Mr van Hulten, which I thank for working together so closely in order to make progress and keep to the timetable which we thought the Council was going to impose on us because it wanted to address this issue at the ECOFIN Council on 5 June.
We asked in vain for the Council to be present - it is too late, the Council is not present, no matter - but we asked it and we pass on the message that we were asked to work quickly and we have worked quickly.
We wrapped it up in a few months and I can assure you that it was no easy job.
So, Commissioner, we followed your lead.
We proposed a great many amendments.
I think that in certain areas we have, without doubt, tried to be diligent, to foster transparency, to foster greater budgetary prudence, a more efficient system, clearer, more transparent, faster application of standards for the beneficiaries of our aid, for those who implement some of our budgets, wherever there were shortcomings, and there are shortcomings, it must be said.
In certain specific areas we noted a fair backlog in the implementation of projects committed but not spent.
We tackled the problem of supporting staff and tried to improve the definition of the concept of supporting staff and I trust that you will find that we have done so efficiently, Commissioner.
We retained the specific rule in the financial regulation in toto with a quarrel which we settled thus.
We think it is better to keep it in the financial regulation as a legislative instrument.
We introduced the notion of financial statements, that is, source law, which we tried to turn into real legislation.
We stressed the independence of OLAF.
We tried to improve a text which, all said and done, grosso modo, we felt had the right idea.
So that finishes my five minutes as rapporteur.
Now, in my own name and on behalf of my political group of Italian radicals, I should like to address the amendments proposed because, as you know, Mr President, something strange is afoot in this debate, in which 230 amendments have been tabled by the Committee on Budgets and by the Committee on Budgetary Control and in which we have a committee chair who has also tabled amendments, on behalf of her group of course.
It is the law, it is the regulation which so requires, with her name against that of her own committee, of which I am a member.
I am sure you will understand that this is rather strange.
Imagine, Mrs Schreyer, you make a proposal, the Commission approves it and the following day Mr Prodi attacks you or amends the proposal which has just been voted by your colleague as such.
It is, after all, rather strange.
A committee which has already examined a great many of these amendments and rejected them.
Then re-tables them on behalf of its chair.
Its Kramer versus Kramer.
I remember a very well-known French minister saying, "a minister shuts up or gets out".
So I think, Mr President, I do not know what you would do in my position if Mrs Fontaine amended a text on Nice, Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, a text already voted by Parliament.
What would you do?
Personally, as rapporteur I would vote against but, as a Member, I feel that there is food for thought here.
Is it that either you are the guarantors of a body or you cannot go against the body which you represent?
It seems a bit bizarre to me.
Many of the amendments were, as I have said, rejected by the committee.
So, inevitably, as rapporteur, I was obliged to say that I was against.
It is embarrassing because it puts you in an awkward position.
There was a consensus in committee to withdraw other amendments and here they are back on the table.
It is embarrassing when you know that a committee has already given the thumbs down.
Others have come in from the Court of Auditors.
The Court of Auditors, however, is not a legislative body; we are all very fond of the Court of Auditors, but we are not here to act as messenger boys, we are here to legislate.
So this is want I wanted to highlight - and I have taken several minutes to do so - because there is something unhealthy here, although some of the amendments are, shall we say, more than honourable and a group of 233 members could have represented the amendments on someone else's behalf.
When I see my chair presenting amendments against my report, in her own name, and against her committee, then I think that there are lessons to be learned.
If you do not agree with your committee, you have to draw your own conclusions and perhaps - why not - think about resigning from a position if that position does not suit a man or women in politics who wants to more power, which is all well and good but then they should resign their position (you cannot umpire and play in the match).
That is why I am against the series of amendments seeking to reintroduce the concept of financial controller.
We are not here to give the Commission discharge.
We shall take great care to ensure that the system introduced and thought up by the Committee of Wise Men, recommended by the Wise Men, this committee which we honoured, is a viable system which works and can be controlled and, if it does not work, we shall be the first to condemn it.
The system is up and running, however, and Parliament has endorsed it several times.
So I urgently recommend that we follow the line taken in my report and by Mr van Hulten and reject this attempt to backtrack, which has no place in our debate, although we shall still have a great deal to discuss.
I will stop there, Mr President, because we are not happy at the moment with the Council's attitude and, if it is alright with you, we shall advise what Parliament's attitude will be tomorrow after the vote.
I wonder - but we shall wait for the Commission - if we need to postpone the final vote.
However, we shall see tomorrow morning.
Mr President, I will speak on behalf of the Budgetary Control Committee and also on behalf of the Socialist Group.
Luckily the two positions are the same on this report.
I would like to begin by thanking Mr Dell'Alba for the excellent cooperation we have had on the Financial Regulation and all the colleagues that have worked with us in the different groups.
Most groups showed a great willingness to compromise.
I would like to thank, in particular, the Liberal, Green, and EDD Groups for their active support in drawing up a package of amendments that was acceptable to a majority of the Budgetary Control Committee.
I was surprised, like my colleague Mr Dell'Alba, that most amendments to this report were tabled by the chair of the Budgetary Control Committee.
I agree with Mr Dell'Alba that, of course every Member is entitled to put down amendments to a report, also on behalf of their group. In the case of a committee chair, however, you have to wonder whether they are mixing up roles to the detriment of the standing of their committee.
These proposals today are the most sweeping changes to the Community's financial rules in 21 years.
For the Budgetary Control Committee, the reform of financial control is the key aspect of this proposal.
Under the Commission's proposal, the ex ante visa issued by a Central Financial Controller will be abolished and instead Directorates-General will be made fully responsible for the lifecycle of expenditure for programmes carried out under their authority.
This is one of the key reforms called for by the Committee of Independent Experts in 1999, when it issued its reports.
The CIE concluded, at the time, that most of the irregularities highlighted by the committee stemmed from decisions to which financial control gave its approval - the committee also stated that the supposed quality guarantee provided by the visa is a myth.
It gave two strong arguments for changing the system and I quote, "First, ex ante checking, whether it be universal or on the basis of sampling is unlikely to be a cost-effective process. The efforts put into checking all transactions is clearly disproportionate while sampling is unlikely to have sufficient dissuasive effect.
The second and fundamental principle is that any retention of ex ante control runs up against a crucial objection that de facto if not de jure, it displaces responsibility for financial irregularity from the person actually managing expenditure onto the person approving it.
This displacement of responsibility means, in effect, that no one is ultimately responsible."
The Court of Auditors also discussed changes to the financial control regime in its Opinion No 4 of 1997.
With respect to the abolition of the ex ante visa it concluded as follows and I quote again, "As for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval, this would not be any more acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedures that provided at least equivalent safeguards and that could involve financial officials other than the Financial Controller."
Has this test been met?
Broadly speaking, yes, at least according to Court Opinion No 2 of this year which commented on the Commission's proposal as follows: The provisions governing the financial actors and therefore the structure of the Community internal control system would represent an important step towards meeting the Court's recommendations.
The case for reform is overwhelming, that much is clear, but it is also to an extent a leap in the dark and it can only work if a number of conditions are met: first authorising officers must be held fully accountable; failure must be recognised and dealt with, not covered up.
(The President urged the speaker to speak more slowly to assist the interpreters)
The same interpreters refuse to translate into Dutch when I speak English, but I am happy to oblige.
Second, the disciplinary procedure must be strengthened.
There has been too little action in the past.
A financial regularities committee would strengthen the procedure as would other amendments we have introduced.
Third, the independence of internal auditors must be guaranteed and so must the professional independence of those that carry out internal audit within the Directorates-General.
Finally, minimum standards of financial controls must be adhered to.
Amendment No 72 sets this out.
In order for this provision to be effective, there is a need for a central official under the responsibility of the DG Budget to set minimum standards without undermining the responsibility of spending DGs.
We will have to negotiate with the Council on this proposal.
The only possibility of doing so effectively is to postpone the vote on the legislative resolution under our rules of procedures.
Discussion on Article 24 showed that the Council does not pay the slightest attention to Parliament's views, even though the President of the Budgets Committee is here today, and that is particularly surprising coming from the Swedish Presidency.
I have been approached in recent weeks by a number of national governments asking us to proceed with our vote without delay.
The sad fact in today's institutional set-up is that if Parliament wants its voice to be heard it must resort to unusual tactics.
I support the case for speedy reform, but on an issue as important as this - financial rules which could with us for the next 21 years - we must refuse to let Parliament's legitimate expectations to negotiate be ignored by an arrogant Council.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
I can assure you that your speech has been translated into perfect Dutch.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to follow Mr Dell'Alba and particularly Mr van Hulten; while I do not share his political aspirations, I recognise his ability as a young person who one day will probably lead the European Union to great heights.
I also recognise that budgetary discipline is based on certain principles: unity, annuality, equilibrium, unit of account, universality, and specification.
However the external budget also requires transparency, because our external budget is constantly exposed to corruption.
There are many practical problems which we have to look at in the external budget.
First, development cooperation is better served by multi-annual programmes rather annual programmes but in the EU this is not so.
We have an annual programme which does not work consistently in terms of output targets.
Second, output targets are not measured in terms of external budgets so that we do not finally know what we have done with our taxpayers' money.
We can never come back to Parliament and report on what has happened with our taxpayers' money.
Third, the external budget is constantly underspent while those in need suffer poverty, malnutrition, hunger, disease, underdevelopment and loss of education and life-quality opportunities.
Yet, rather than return the funds which are predicted at the beginning of the budget to be unspent - which could then be returned back to Member States who could spend that money more effectively - we keep this money for more than three years and then overspend it.
I want to be proud of what we do.
I want the world to recognise that we make a substantial contribution.
I want our development assistance programme to be the best in the world.
We have a long way to go before we achieve that.
Mr President, I should like to expressly thank you for pointing out that the rapporteur' s speaking time must not be used to express personal opinions - let alone in such a sharp way that is almost defamatory!
I should like to protest that I as an MP, which is what I am - I shall be speaking on behalf of my group later - get what amounts to a ban on speaking for expressing an opinion on the subject that I have never concealed.
I also have the right to sign for the group amendments that my group supports.
Please also note that a rapporteur also has to maintain a certain neutrality and represent the opinion of the committee.
I am speaking here as a Member of Parliament and not as the chair, and I have not signed anywhere as chair.
I must ask that these be kept separate and that the work not be confused in this way.
We actually have quite a good climate in the committee.
I am rather shaken by the way things are proceeding here this evening!
Mr President, perhaps I can change the prevailing mood and introduce a positive note.
I should like to start by thanking everyone who helped to draft this important report.
It was a stubborn, time-consuming and difficult report due to its sheer size and the number of specialist topics which it covers.
The report which results from the amendments to be voted on tomorrow will, I think, represent a balanced compromise between numerous views and a considerable improvement on the original proposal.
First, it includes the basic priorities put forward by the European Parliament and, secondly, it includes many of the comments and proposals made by the Court of Auditors.
At the same time, it endorses the need for the European Commission to be flexible in implementing the budget, especially given its new activity-based presentation.
It proposes ways of improving expenditure commitments, useful and necessary addenda, simplifications designed to make the provisions of the new regulation clear and transparent and, finally, it strengthens the responsibility of financial agents without touching their independence or autonomy.
I think the proposed addenda are a step in the right direction and will certainly help to enhance the efficiency of the financial provisions, not that other improvements are not needed.
I do not want to expound on this further but, before closing my speech, I too should like to highlight an unfortunate inconsistency.
I refer to the fact that, although the European Parliament is one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, when it comes to the financial regulation, it does not, unfortunately, have the same degree of responsibility, which is basically limited to consultation with the Council.
I think that it is our duty to insist on a proper dialogue on mutual terms and on an equal footing with the Commission and the Council within the conciliation procedure.
That is why I too agree that Parliament should only vote on the amendments tomorrow.
Mr President, recasting the Financial Regulation is a necessarily ponderous process.
This regulation is not just a budgetary framework but is also a framework for the provision and financial supervision of accounts and for the duties and responsibilities of the main budgetary players.
All of these issues were addressed in the same article of the Treaty, which stipulates the same procedures for all of them, but this does not mean that they should necessarily be dealt with in the same regulatory texts.
The fact that their approval requires unanimity in the Council makes changing them even more difficult.
Perhaps these reasons explain why this process has been dragging on since July 1996, when the Commission presented its first proposal for recasting the Financial Regulation.
All the signs indicate that we are still to see a further stage added.
The concern to give fresh coherence to a text that has become a tangle of loosely defined rules and provisions therefore appears, of course, to be the most important one in the current round of redrafting.
It is neither possible nor desirable, in this round of budgetary framing, to forget the relevant sectoral regulation, which concerns agricultural expenditure, the Structural Funds, research and development and external actions. Nor should we forget the important Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline.
In this field, because it is neither politically nor legally acceptable to bulldoze existing regulations and agreements by adopting provisions that run counter to the Financial Regulation, we must reduce the specific rules in the sectoral regulations to the absolute minimum. We also need these to be properly linked with those of the Financial Regulation.
Furthermore, we need to make the Interinstitutional Agreement compatible and bring it into line with the Financial Regulation and consider the need to include the Financial Regulation in any future revision of this agreement.
The second major issue concerns the Community budget system, organised into authorisations and payments, and the timeframes needed to implement them.
The current system demonstrates weaknesses and problems with which we are all familiar, but there is no guarantee that the innovations proposed by the Commission - and even less those suggested by other institutions - will do anything to improve the situation.
This is an issue on which a more thorough discussion is needed, based on a full and rigorous study of the workings of the current system.
We hope that the Commission will devote the necessary attention to this in its future proposals.
Another extremely important point concerns delays in payments.
Recently, the European institutions approved, at the proposal of the Commission, a directive that imposes harsh penalties on both public and private authorities that do not comply with the maximum payment delay of thirty days.
How can the European institutions then seek to exempt themselves from the rules that they have approved for all of the Union' s other institutions, be they public or private?
In this regard, I wish to point out that the Commission communication on this matter is far from satisfactory.
Only a commitment by the Commission to lead by example in applying to itself the rules that it is proposing for others would be acceptable.
By the same token, we Socialists consider it to be a point of honour that this Parliament' s political groups fully comply with all of the procedures that we approve in this Chamber for the Community expenditure of other institutions.
We shall pay very close attention to the way in which each group approaches this matter in tomorrow' s vote.
Lastly, I must comment on the Council' s failure to reply to our repeated invitations to discuss the amendments to the Financial Regulation.
It would be both absurd and unacceptable for the European Parliament, which is ultimately responsible for discharging the budget, to lose any power to act as a result of the rules governing this regulation.
In these circumstances, all we can do is postpone delivering Parliament' s final statement on its position.
I wish to conclude by congratulating our rapporteurs, Gianfranco Dell'Alba and Michiel van Hulten, who have produced an excellent piece of work, and we wish to see this work continue in the same climate of cooperation in which it has been undertaken until now.
Mr President, to start with I would like to thank the rapporteur, Gianfranco Dell'Alba, for his excellent report.
Drawing it up, analysing the proposed amendments and presenting compromises was an enormous task.
In that respect, this report and its preparation are in a class of their own.
At the same time I would like to thank Michiel van Hulten for excellent teamwork.
Renewing the Financial Regulation is the most important step in modernising the administration of the Commission and the whole of the EU.
Its most important objective is to improve the efficiency of administration, clarify personal responsibility and speed up the movement of funds.
The EU has a poor reputation as a payer of bills as payments are made many times more slowly than would be acceptable in the world of business and when making payments in Member States.
However, the greatest reason for reform is to clarify personal responsibility and financial accountability.
This can only be achieved once both administrative and financial responsibility are clearly united under the same people as is now being done.
Renewing the Financial Regulation is essential to improving the efficiency of administration.
It opens up the opportunity to develop results-based management and activity-based budgeting.
In this way the work of offices and bodies can be managed more on the basis of goals and results rather than on the basis of supervision and detailed instructions.
Bureaucracy will be reduced and at the same time the bodies will be given the opportunity to improve their own working methods themselves.
This would also increase their own responsibility for their work.
However, achieving reform means reforming personnel regulations, which would require good cooperation with employee organisations, among others.
However, change is absolutely essential.
Finally, I would like to present some details that are important to my group.
A three-year ceiling must be set for the use of funds granted, after which the funds unused would be cancelled.
Transferring funds to the following year is an important tool in flexible budgeting policy.
In principle we support the proposals of the rapporteur.
Mr President, the present Financial Regulation is out of date.
It no longer meets the requirements of modern financial management.
The Commission has put forward a proposal for a new Financial Regulation based on the principles of decentralised responsibility and transparency.
The two rapporteurs, Mr Dell' Alba and Mr van Hulten, have worked through the proposal in the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control and tabled amendments.
They deserve praise and recognition for this.
However, my group finds a number of points still open.
Firstly, the Commission' s most recent report on combating fraud in the year 2000 showed a massive increase in fraud and irregularities compared to the previous year.
Around EUR 2 billion were lost.
Experience shows that at best 15% to 20% of the losses can be recovered.
In such circumstances, is there any sense in abolishing preventive ex ante checks by independent financial control?
We do not want a return to schematic centralised preliminary controls that took away responsibility and created a false sense of security.
Rather, on the basis of efficient risk analyses and random checks, independent financial controllers should in future help to ensure decentrally that taxpayers' money is not spent illegally from the outset.
Secondly: with more responsibility at all levels, it will in future be possible to hold financial actors liable for negligence or deliberate breaches of the financial regulations.
Our motion here is designed to create a fair procedure by means of an independent body for all institutions.
On the matter of independence: we are astonished to note that the Commission in its proposal for the new Financial Regulation has quietly deleted the independent right of action for internal auditors that is enshrined in the present Financial Regulation.
We should like to restore this again through a motion.
The final point: the Advisory Committee on Procurements and Contracts.
This is the advisory body that must be consulted before contracts are awarded.
At the last session in Strasbourg, this House resolved to reform this procedure.
I think we will lose credibility if we now call for the body to be abolished 14 days later.
Mr President, I too have read the report recently published by the European Commission on the fight against fraud.
EUR two billion in tax money disappeared in the year 2000 as a result of fraud and irregularities.
That is an extremely worrying phenomenon. Europe has a bad reputation as it is in this area, and we need to pull out all the stops to fight this phenomenon.
This evening, we are discussing the review of the Financial Regulation.
Against this backdrop, I should like to make a few observations.
It will not come as a surprise to you that I too advocate effective and modern control.
The Commission and rapporteurs want to abandon centralised, independent ex ante control.
That must be replaced by decentralised ex post control.
We debated this very issue at an earlier occasion.
I then noted that I welcomed the introduction of an independent ex post audit, but that that should not be at the expense of the opportunity of independent ex ante control.
If we are to introduce this across the board, I fear that we will turn this fine dream into a nightmare.
I am in favour of a system in which independent ex post audits are the rule.
The option of independent ex ante control must continue to exist.
I can think of many situations in which a systematic or random ex ante control is necessary in the event of proven irregularities.
If we remove this option from the Financial Regulation, we will surrender an important weapon in the fight against fraud, and that would be irresponsible at a time when we have not gained any experience of decentralised ex post control.
I would therefore call on my fellow MEPs to support our amendments in this connection, so as to avoid the abolition of ex ante control.
Thank you, Mr President, for your reactions and your keen-sighted ability to notice that I am present in the House.
I would like to remind the illustrious rapporteur, Mr Dell'Alba, that above and beyond differences of opinion, which are always legitimate, there must be parliamentary courtesy and the individual right of Members to carry out their work, which includes the presentation of amendments should they deem it necessary.
In any event, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we should be pleased, firstly because we are dealing with the first broad legislative proposal on the financial regulation of the Union, which runs in partnership with the administrative reform of management and human resources procedures and which must be the undeniable political objectives of Parliament and the Commission.
It was decided - correctly, in my view - not to correct the defects in the legislative framework employed until now and, instead, to implement a new administrative culture on control and spending efficiency in the quest for the common objective of the better and more transparent management of public money.
The rules on decision-making in this field, however, show very little political logic.
We should therefore be pleased with the strategy which the rapporteur is suggesting: to vote for amendments which reflect good work and a good departure point for the discussion of the more delicate aspects of the proposal, and to force the Council to take account of the opinion of the European Parliament when the Commission presents its amended proposal.
During the desirable and possible interinstitutional dialogue, we must try to negotiate a financial regulation which is intended to be permanent, which substantially takes account of this Parliament' s often repeated priorities in this field.
In order to achieve this permanence there are some very controversial aspects, such as the removal of ex ante control, which may distract us from other deficiencies with broader repercussions.
I am referring to the regulation of the public markets and to subsidies.
The current situation is not only bad, but chaotic.
Throughout these recent years, we have not been able to harmonise the multi-coloured situation of public contracts.
With regard to the information which Parliament requires for the purposes of the discharge of the budget - and I would ask you to be benevolent, Mr President - I believe that the Commission' s position is coherent insofar as it respects the basic elements of the framework Interinstitutional Agreement on the application of Article 206 of the Treaty.
I believe that in this field we can and must agree a text based on a consensus in the future, safeguarding the principles which are essential to this Parliament, such as human rights, fundamental freedoms and non-interference in sub judice procedures.
Mr President, for an organisation with an expenditure in excess of EUR 92 billion the Financial Regulation is almost the most important legal basis for ensuring careful use of European money and preventing abuse so far as possible.
It is more necessary than ever to stress this aspect because the Commission itself informed us two weeks ago that the sum of money lost as a result of fraud and irregularities in the year 2000 amounts to an impressive EUR 2028 million.
That really is nothing for Europe to be proud of!
Remedial action is more than necessary.
The only question is how the Commission proposes to rectify the situation.
As part of its reform programme it wants to abolish the independent financial controller, the very institution that experience shows to have been the most successful in combating fraud - I only have to mention the FlÃ©chard case.
That is like the police ordering all guard dogs to be put down after the number of burglaries in a residential area has doubled.
Parliament has argued for decentralised independent financial control, in fact it has voted for it several times, most recently on 4 April 2001 in the preliminary report for discharge for 1998.
The financial controller is also anchored in the Treaty.
An internal auditor is not a financial controller in new clothing but a dummy package that for my group at any rate is unacceptable.
A necessary counterpart to independent financial control is the clear assignment of responsibility, of liability for deliberate contraventions or neglect of duty by officials such as is, incidentally, found in the national laws of all the Fifteen.
It seems to me that the Commission' s reform efforts will in this instance result in financial responsibility being passed to and fro like in a marshalling yard until in the end nobody knows what track it is on.
The Financial Regulation should make for clarity, transparency and comprehensibility in the implementation of the budget.
That is the only way we shall get the citizens to accept it!
Mr President, as the Council is present today, I wonder if you would like to ask the President-in-Office to comment on the observations made by Members.
Thank you, Commissioner, for creating a quadrilogue for us.
Rule 121(5) of the Rules of Procedure allows the Council to be heard if it so wishes.
Do you wish to be heard?
You have the floor.
. (SV) Mr President, it is an unexpected but welcome honour to be able to speak to you here this evening.
I have been listening very carefully to what has been said.
Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the substance of the views put forward, as the Council has not yet adopted a position.
This will happen at the ECOFIN meeting next week.
I am completely convinced that as soon as Parliament has made its decision, the Council will look at it very carefully.
Despite being unable to comment on the substance, I would venture to refer to what the Council said earlier, namely that we are extremely keen for a decision on the new Financial Regulation to be made as quickly as possible.
Hopefully, Parliament will be able to make a decision tomorrow, so that the Commission can proceed with revising the proposal.
In this case, we would be able to present it in September and hopefully achieve a decision on the Final Regulation as quickly as possible.
I have, of course, also noted what Mrs Schreyer said about her bringing the issue up at the ECOFIN meeting and I look forward to this discussion.
Thank you.
Mr Dell'Alba has asked to speak.
At this stage of the debate it can only be on a point of order.
Mr President, it is 11.20.
I just wanted to clarify something for Mrs Schreyer.
I would like to thank her for what she has told us, and for her criticism of our report, which also goes a little way towards substantiating why we want to keep this strategy.
When you spoke of negative expenditure and negative revenue, you criticised our proposal by saying that our amendments were going to create a sort of generalised revenue, but I think that you are mistaken.
What we wanted was for this idea of allocated revenue to include the old principle of budgetary unit and a compensation mechanism which would stop us from overshooting the financial perspectives.
As for the Council, I would like to thank it.
I am sorry if, at the beginning of this point, it is a point of order, I said that the Council was not there, because it was not represented at ministerial level.
That you intervened is a first.
Allow me to say that Mr van Hulten, who is watching what I say, has already clarified what our idea is and you said you would wait for our opinion tomorrow, which is precisely what we are not going to do; we are going to wait for the Council to make a move, as the Commissioner said, and we shall give our opinion after that.
This is the only way of dealing with the Council - through the procedure which we intend to follow tomorrow.
Mr President, the Council is often asked to intervene during debates in Parliament.
It rarely does so and I would like to thank the Council for intervening on this occasion.
I withdraw my comment about the arrogance of the Council and I hope that this is the beginning of a fruitful discussion.
Thank you, Mr van Hulten.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Compulsory safety belts
The next item is the report (A5-0141/2001) by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/671/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes (COM(2000) 815 - C5-0684/2000 - 2000/0315(COD)).
. (SV) Mr President, at this very late hour I, as rapporteur, would like to say a few words about the report.
Firstly, I would like to thank all my colleagues for such excellent teamwork on the committee.
I would also like to thank the Commission for an excellent proposal for a directive regarding safety belts and child restraint systems in vehicles.
This is an important issue.
I would like once again to repeat that a very large number of people die in road traffic accidents in EU Member States.
We are talking about around 42,000 people a year.
We would never accept such a high death rate in any other form of transport, so we must act.
One such action is the proposal now being tabled by the Commission. We must also remember that children are at great risk on the roads.
The most common cause of death among children and young people is traffic accidents.
The question is whether the EU should legislate on safety belts and child safety in cars.
My answer is yes.
I think it is very important.
Firstly, it has a legal basis in the Treaty of Rome.
Secondly there is already legislation, a directive, which must now be strengthened, due to a need for such action.
We know that safety belts save lives.
This is particularly the case regarding children.
Accident research shows that the risk of serious injury is seven times higher for children who do not use a restraint system than for children who do use such a system.
There is therefore a need for such a system.
In addition, traffic in Europe today is, to a very large extent, transboundary.
People travel in private cars, but also in commercial vehicles.
Private and commercial motoring is increasing across borders, as we have seen in a report today.
We also have rapidly increasing numbers of tourists, which creates a need for common regulations with regard to fundamental safety measures on our roads.
It is therefore important that we have a high level of safety in all EU countries, so that we know what regulations apply to private drivers or occupational drivers, and also to car manufacturers.
It is important for them to have common safety requirements so that the regulations are clear.
At the same time, it is also important to consumers that safety systems become cheaper, which will be the case if the regulations are common throughout the EU.
The Commission' s proposal is a strengthening of a previous directive, which states that all passengers in a vehicle equipped with safety belts must use them, that all children must, without exception, be restrained in approved child car seats, that children under three may not travel in cars without suitable child car seats, with the exception of taxis, and that the use of rear-facing child car seats is forbidden if the air bag has not been de-activated.
All these are good proposals.
The committee agrees that these should also be put forward as Parliament' s proposals.
However, we propose six amendments.
Briefly, the first amendment is that the Commission, along with the Member States and road safety organisations, should promote an information campaign.
Our second amendment is that the height of the child should determine when a child can use an adult seat belt.
In Amendment 4, we want manufacturers to state which child car seats fit which car models.
We also propose that rural buses used in city traffic - not particularly common, but it happens - should not be covered by the requirement for compulsory use.
We also want the Commission, in partnership with the automotive industry, to develop safer and more user-friendly systems for air bags.
In addition, a report on this should be incorporated into the report to be presented no later than 1 August 2004 on the implementation of the directive.
The Council will discuss the Commission' s proposals at the Transport Council at the end of June.
I look forward to our being able to reach a common decision in the EU and to our being able to implement this vital measure which is fundamental to road safety in the EU.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people die on our roads in Europe every year.
As MEPs we therefore have a great responsibility to work for greater safety on the roads.
We also know, however, that traffic is increasing from year to year and one of the consequences of this is that it becomes a greater source of danger.
In my opinion, the question of the compulsory wearing of safety belts has a crucial part to play.
In general, I am very much in agreement with the Commission' s proposal for improving the safety of drivers and passengers.
I also agree in principle that it should be compulsory for safety belts to be fastened at all times in all seats that are fitted with them or with the basic requirement that seats fitted with safety belts or child restraint systems should be used.
I also see it as a fundamental obligation that restraint systems should be used for children under 12.
I should like to note, however, that Member States need to be given some leeway for the national transposition of the directive on certain points.
I am thinking of the use of restraint systems for very small children.
I am also thinking of medical reasons and of quite specific situations such as the requirements for minibuses and coaches which the rapporteur has also mentioned.
More details would be taking us too far here.
Harmonisation of legislation at European level will make for transparency and clarity and improve the various national regulations.
All in all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur most sincerely on this report, which I think is also a very balanced one, and I can already assure you today that my group will agree to this report.
I should like to point out, however, that the detailed transposition of the directive must now be undertaken by the Member States and in the end it is the Member States who are responsible for safety on Europe' s roads.
Mr President, Commissioner, the latest findings in accident research show that 50% of fatally injured vehicle occupants do not have their seatbelts fastened.
Tremendous progress has been made in road traffic safety.
I come from part of a country where there were no child seats or child restraint systems at all ten years ago and retractable seat belts were a luxury.
Then in 1991 I had the opportunity of being involved with devising the compulsory seat belt directive.
Today we are already talking about the need to adapt that directive to scientific and technical progress.
The wide-ranging findings of accident research and the modern safety restraint systems developed by the industry make the present-day situation unacceptable.
It is irresponsible to allow children under three years of age to be carried on the back seats of cars without anything to hold them or in child seats on the passenger seat without switching off the airbag.
It must no longer be permissible for larger children to be secured using the belt intended for adults.
Exceptions from the general compulsory safety belt rule for lorry drivers, for example, must in future also be things of the past.
The proposal embodied in six amendments tabled by the European Parliament to amend the directive in question will, among other things, make for technically safer solutions and above all ones that are easier for the consumer to use.
The latter point in particular makes it more likely that the restraint systems fitted will actually be used.
More than 50% of children still travel without using a seat belt, even where restraints are present in the vehicle.
Parents seem to be unaware that the risk of their children suffering a serious or even fatal injury as a result of an accident is seven times greater if they are not wearing a seat belt.
Development work is continuing.
Present-day child restraint systems are evaluated on the basis of frontal crash test results and almost always get good marks.
However, 70% of all fatal accidents involving children in cars are the result of side crashes.
That is where these systems fail.
I recommend acceptance of the amendments before us today for adapting the directive.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Hedkvist Petersen very sincerely on the report she has presented.
It demonstrates her personal sensitivity, and that of the whole committee, to an issue as important as road safety, in an attempt to reduce this unacceptable figure of 42 000 deaths per year, which is the number of people killed as a result of traffic accidents in the European Union. As she says in her report, this figure is too high.
In December 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal making the use of safety belts provided for that purpose compulsory for all road-vehicle users and, in the case of small children, child restraint systems in cars.
I must say, ladies and gentlemen, that if you visit any retailer you will see that practically all child restraint systems currently on the market already comply with the legislation in force.
The proposed directive therefore eliminates the exceptions which appeared in the original directive, since they were conceived of in different circumstances and allowed the use of adult safety belts in the absence of a child restraint system.
We now believe that to be unnecessary.
The proposed directive, as well as protecting children in cars, will help to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries resulting from accidents in coaches, minibuses and lorries, by making the use of safety belts compulsory for drivers and passengers when those safety belts are supplied.
The correct use of safety belts and child restraint systems is one of the most important measures being proposed by the Commission in the field of road safety.
Both you in Parliament and the Council have supported this proposal by firmly backing the Commission' s working programme on road safety priorities in the Union, which include reporting on, detailing and classifying the measures to be adopted, making the use of safety belts and child restraint systems one of the fundamental priorities for road safety.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will now refer to specific amendments.
Only one, Amendment No 4, is unacceptable to the Commission. Our reason for not accepting it is that it would require manufacturers of vehicles to indicate which child restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles and can be easily installed in them.
While the Commission acknowledges that there have been problems with installing some systems in certain vehicles, the fact is that the amendment would breach the rules on the internal market and establishment as well as the directive proposed in the latest international standard on child restraint systems.
Nevertheless, non-legislative measures are being adopted, particularly by means of the Euro-NCAP programme, with which, as you know, car manufactures are associated, to persuade those manufacturers to indicate which restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles.
I imagine that this initiative will reduce the problem, together with the fact that the restraint systems governed by Regulation 44/03 are easier to install and safer than the systems previously available.
Lastly, there are two amendments which would force the Commission to adopt measures which it has already planned to take.
One is Amendment No 1, which would oblige the Commission to launch an awareness-raising campaign in parallel with the implementation of the directive. Amendment No 6(2), according to which the Commission should, in conjunction with the car industry, study the possibilities of using more user-friendly airbags, especially where rear-facing restraint systems are being used.
The Commission would suggest that these two amendments do not appear in the legislative text, but that they be included in the preamble, since we accept that they are of interest and importance for the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have summed up the Commission' s position in relation to the report.
I repeat that, with the exception of Amendment No 4, which we must reject, we accept all the others, bearing in mind the comments I have made on Amendment No 1 and Amendment No 6(2), which instead of appearing in the legislative articles, would simply appear in the preamble to the final text.
Thank you very much. It only remains for me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, once again, and also Mrs Schierhuber, for her speech, and to express my agreement with her.
We will now have to see how the different Member States apply the legislation we are approving here.
Precisely for this reason, and not only on this specific issue, but taking account of all the requirements of road safety, we are going to make a proposal on which we are working with Commissioner Vitorino to try to harmonise the effective application by the different Member States of the controls and also the penalties in this field.
Parliament thanks the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Equal treatment for men and women
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0173/2001) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions [COM(2000) 334 - C5-0369/2000 - 2000/0142(COD)]
Mr President, the European Union already has a quarter of a century of legislative tradition which obliges it to take equality between women and men in working life seriously.
The directive under discussion today took on its original form as early as 1976.
We can state that in over a quarter of a century our societies have developed considerably in many respects and it is time to revise our view of equality between women and men at work to meet the requirements of today.
The Treaty of Amsterdam also obliges us to do so, as it lays down that equality between women and men must be broadly taken into account in all the work of the Community.
We are now facing entirely new challenges which we must tackle through legislation.
In this directive the European Union presents for the first time actions binding on Member States to prevent sexual harassment which is prevalent in the workplace.
In this respect, I can also state that research shows that one in two women in the European Union has suffered sexual harassment at work.
It is quite clear that from time to time this can also affect men; men can also be the victims of sexual harassment but as a rule, however, still today the victims are mainly women.
In this respect, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities suggests that we go a little further than the Commission originally intended.
The Committee would like the Member States to start preventive work to prevent sexual harassment and for employers to be obliged to create working conditions in which sexual harassment is unlikely.
I have also emphasised the fact that this may improve the position of the employer, since if employers can show that they have initiated such preventive work, they will surely be in a stronger position should conflict arise.
Maternity protection also needs strengthening.
I myself am from Finland and it is often thought that Finland is a model country in terms of equal opportunities.
However, I can say that in our country too women around the age of thirty, for example, are having abortions more often than should be the case.
Research carried out into the reasons behind this found that this may be due to there being so much competition in the workplace. Employers discriminate against women who are at an age where they are likely to have children.
We would like to put a stop to this once and for all.
This is sexual discrimination, which is banned.
This directive also gives the victims of sexual discrimination stronger legal protection and also requires that victims of sexual discrimination are still able to take legal action even once a working relationship has been terminated.
Here they can receive support from an independent body, which this directive requires be set up.
I am sure that such independent bodies for equal opportunities already exist in most Member States but I would like to emphasise the importance of this issue when considering candidate countries.
In another context the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has focused considerable attention on the fact that issues concerning equality between women and men in candidate countries have not been as strongly emphasised in accession negotiations as they should have been.
This can also be strengthened by creating sufficient institutions whose task, according to the law, is to ensure that equality is achieved and even promoted.
I would like to emphasise that social development has brought with it new types of equality issues.
There was a great deal of discussion within the Committee on whether young men and fathers need stronger protection against sexual discrimination.
I believe that we have reached a good compromise in including fathers and their rights in this directive.
In my opinion, this is highly appropriate at a time when the equal opportunities discussion has largely moved towards looking at how men can take part in realising their family responsibilities.
In this way, we will be able to head towards real equality.
Mr President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs felt that, despite the progress that has been made in legislation, discrimination remains in pay and the labour market is still segmented, with salaries remaining low in the traditional sectors and tending to persist in services and in the so-called 'new economy' .
Forty per cent of the growth in women' s employment is due to part-time and independent work, which receives minimal wages.
Although this is an alternative to unemployment and may help reconcile work and family life, it nevertheless creates a new form of discrimination, which is not sufficiently described by the statistics.
One example of this is the recruitment of over-qualified people for less high-powered jobs.
The Structural Funds must provide an incentive to the social partners to adopt agreements on equality.
The Lisbon Council decisions, the broad employment guidelines for 2001, the Social Agenda and the new provisions of the Treaty all define the importance of increasing employment amongst women, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, not simply to comply with a law, but mainly for the sake of economic balance and to ensure that pensions are sustainable.
What is important is to get the overall picture correct, even if we achieve this in a roundabout way.
The texts submitted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs propose new formulae for the concepts of positive action, of indirect discrimination, which victimises one or more individuals and of harassment as a phenomenon of domination and humiliation with or without direct sexual abuse.
I would put it like this: we are opting for an approach that we consider to be more wide-ranging and more appropriate.
The members of this committee were unanimous in extending protection for maternity and paternity leave, for adoption and during pregnancy and, once again, we recommend, as Parliament has done, that Directive 92/85/EC be revised.
The right to return to work laid down in Directive 76/207/EEC - and on this point we disagree with Mrs Hautala' s report - must enable women, in order to protect their job following maternity leave, to take up an equivalent position in the event that their job changes or becomes defunct.
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, following on from the famous ruling by the European Court of Justice on 17 October 1975, it will soon be six years since we started to discuss the amendment of the 1976 Directive on equality as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.
The Commission believed that it was doing the right thing by submitting a proposal to us in 1996 to amend that directive - a directive which at least had the great advantage of encouraging, in practical terms, equality between men and women in the workplace, in the areas concerned.
The amendment proposed in 1976 was intended solely to safeguard positive actions, which were put at risk by the 1975 judgement.
As the rapporteur on that proposal, which failed to reassure me, I believed I was doing the right thing, this time, in waiting for another ruling by the Court of Justice in a similar case, the Marshall case. This ruling was issued in November 1997 and, this time, was not in favour of Mr Marshall, who felt that he was being discriminated against when a positive action was taken in favour of a female colleague.
We looked at certain aspects again, to determine whether or not positive actions are, in fact, discriminatory, because there had been this U-turn on the part of the Court.
Even so, on the basis of the truism that we are all in the hands of God, whether at sea or in court, Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities was, at the time, willing to support me in asking the Commission to withdraw its proposal, which was considered to be inadequate, particularly because the Treaty of Amsterdam had since been signed.
On 8 March 1999, therefore, we asked the Commission, here in Parliament, to withdraw its proposal and to submit to us a new one based on the ratified Treaty of Amsterdam.
We explained this request, emphasising that under Articles 2, 3 and 141 of the Treaty of Amsterdam the right to equality between men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, which requires equality to be achieved by a series of real steps towards positive action.
Our message was clear: the proposed directive should contain an imperative legal mandate to take positive measures whenever they are necessary in order to achieve equality between men and women and to remedy the under-representation of women in the decision-making process.
The Commission braced itself for the task.
It is already coming up to a year since it submitted a proposal to us to amend the 1976 Directive.
Personally, I should have preferred the Commission to present us with an entirely new version, rather than piecemeal amendments here and there, because the Commission' s text gave rise to almost 200 amendments by the rapporteur and the various committees involved, and these were often drawn up without reference to the basic text, and with the intention, albeit worthy, of trying in that directive to reinvent the entire policy on equality in a number of other fields covered by other directives.
One might rightly regard these other directives as being in need of improvement, but this amendment has nothing to do with those directives.
This did not make my task, as the previous rapporteur and as the notional rapporteur, for my group this time, any easier, because unfortunately I was not prepared to forget the message I referred to earlier in the context of my 1999 report.
Personally, I take the view that the text proposed by the Committee on Women' s Rights has taken too much on board, and in some places, it is not very stable, in legal terms; it does not demonstrate the responsible attitude which the Council and the Commission are entitled to expect from their co-legislator, namely Parliament.
I have tried to make people see reason, but I have been only partially successful.
In particular I regret those amendments, which disregard Article 141 of the Treaty.
I regret the amendments that introduce so-called definitions.
I regret the muddle over maternity protection, and the confusion between maternity leave for women and parental...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for her thorough work and for her willingness to take into account all the contributions and suggestions that all the political groups made on such a delicate matter.
The last speech showed how intense the discussion within the Committee on Women' s Rights was, because it is quite true that the 1976 directive played a remarkable role, but 25 years have passed and both social behaviour and the role of women have changed.
Behind us we have numerous decisions of the Court of Justice but, most importantly, we have the Treaty of Amsterdam which, from the legal standpoint, gives us the opportunity to consolidate and make more effective the legal instruments which, as we are quite aware, are instruments, but vital instruments for implementing active policies and for putting the principle of equal opportunities into practice, even as regards access to employment.
The temptation to try to use this amendment to the directive to tackle many of the problems facing women has been great - in this respect Mrs Lulling is right - but I believe that the result of our labours is, from a legal standpoint, absolutely consistent with the proposals and objectives of the draft amendment that the Commission presented to us.
I believe the definitions of 'direct discrimination' and 'indirect discrimination' which we have taken from the Commission proposal and improved upon are such as to make the use of this instrument clear at a legal level.
The inclusion of harassment and sexual harassment as elements of discrimination is, without a shadow of a doubt, equally clear, as is also the clarification that the right to maternity, like the right to paternity, cannot be used as an instrument for enforcing discrimination.
The possibility of putting into practice positive actions like, indeed, the possibility given to us by Article 141(4) of the Treaty, is, I believe, an equally clear instrument, so that the directive - which I hope will be operational by the end of this year and will be an instrument at the service of all the Member States, all women, all organisations - may truly become one more instrument added to those that the European Union has for all these years placed at the service of so many Member States.
Somebody raised the point that the European Union might interfere more than it should do under the principle of subsidiarity.
Well, in my opinion, not even this could ever be used as an excuse by anybody, because the legal instruments that can be adopted are specified here and in some cases there are obligations associated with them and in others opportunities, depending on the laws of the Member States.
But I believe and hope that, today, the House will, by a large majority, approve Mrs Hautala' s proposal, which has the consensus of the overwhelming majority of the Committee on Women' s Rights, because I feel that this, too, will be a step forwards in making one of the basic principles of our Community - the principle of equal opportunities - become a reality.
Mr President, I should like to add my voice to the congratulations being offered to Mrs Heidi Hautala: she has sought compromises, she has come halfway to meet our various concerns.
Consequently, I hope that her efforts will be rewarded at eleven o' clock, since a report in which so much hard work has been invested and about which there should be a large measure of agreement, must be assured of a sizeable majority in this Parliament.
You can count on my group at any rate.
When people ask me what the value added of Europe is, it is always very easy simply to give the examples of what Europe has done to promote equal rights for men and women.
A great deal has already changed, including in my own country, the Netherlands.
We sometimes think that we are in the vanguard, but the truth is far from that and a great deal still needs to change.
This revision is very important in that respect and accordingly I am glad that this is now going ahead in Europe.
Mr President, sexual harassment at work must be outlawed.
It is terribly difficult to combat.
Victims feel they are alone.
It really is a major step forward that this will now be regarded as discrimination, because that allows us to deal with the problem better.
But of course the saying "prevention is better than cure" applies here too.
And if companies are now obliged to take preventive measures, that simply means that this problem, if things go well, will be banished.
Motherhood will be better protected by this legislation, since it is unfortunately still the case that with applications or career decisions, employers still weigh up whether they will be "losing" a woman for a time, because that is how they still see it, to maternity leave.
The only way of ensuring that such weighing up no longer takes place and that that form of discrimination disappears is to ensure a much better distribution of care responsibilities between men and women.
That is also the reason why our group feels it is important that paternity leave can be claimed by men, and that if that option does not exist, this is simply another case of discrimination.
Hence our amendment.
I must say that I was surprised that Christian Democrats in the women' s committee tried to remove it.
My understanding was that there is now a pact on the matter.
I hope that this is indeed the case, and that at eleven o' clock it will prove so and that at eleven o' clock we shall all be here and we will be able to give a very clear signal that fathers should be entitled to leave too.
In conclusion, Mr President, a few words about the exemplary role that European institutions could play in this.
I mean the intended amendment of the terms of employment of employees of institutions like, for example this Parliament, and also the Commission.
If we look at opportunities for maternity leave in the European institutions, we see that the situation is depressing.
I hope that the Commissioner will be able to point out to her colleagues that they have an important function in showing that we, at any rate, do things in a certain way in these institutions and can use this to give an important signal to Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, the eleventh annual report on the Structural Funds, which for the first time examines Community measures in favour of equality between men and women, indicates that although the active participation of women in the labour market has been continuously increasing in the last three decades, there are still considerable differences between the two sexes.
In almost all the Member States, unemployment rates are higher for women than for men.
The difference in employment rates between the sexes is an average of around 20% in the Member States.
Employment among women decreases according to the number of children that they have.
Women do the majority of non-paid work in the home, including caring for children and other dependants.
Even in countries that have high employment rates, women are over represented in part-time jobs, in many cases not out of choice.
Moreover, the differences in salary between men and women are still considerable: 28% for medium term at Community level.
In short, it says that here in Europe, the champion of human rights, women do not have the same rights in practice as men, they are still less represented in public institutions and in decision-making positions in private entities, and they are still the prime victims of ill treatment within couples and of sexual violence.
I am convinced that women cannot be truly free and equal to men until they have the same opportunities to get a job, are paid the same salary and gain true financial independence.
Once the day comes when these objectives have been achieved, the other inequalities will also have disappeared.
It is true that the Lisbon European Council has stated an objective of increasing the Community average rate of employment among women from the current level of 51% to above 60% by 2010.
But when I think that, for example, in Spain the level of women in employment currently scarcely reaches 35%, I think that it is not going to be 10 but 20 years before we can talk about real equality between the sexes, especially if the shortages of jobs in general continue to be so great.
Perhaps it is time that we took ourselves more seriously, for example, the proposals from Orio Giarini and Patrick Liedtke, and their Report to the Club of Rome, entitled "The employment dilemma: the future of employment" -where they advocate the division of the working day, or the proposals of Peter Hall that focus taxation on business consumption and remove the burdens from the cost of labour factor.
The challenge of equality is above all the challenge of employment.
I therefore welcome the initiative to modify Directive 76/207/EEC, from 25 years ago, on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment of men and women.
I also congratulate Mrs Hautala, chairman of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on her excellent report.
Mr President, I would also like to give my support for all the praise of Mrs Hautala, who has worked very hard on this matter.
I imagine it has not been easy, as rapporteur, to reconcile all views, although the majority of people taking part in the work were women.
I would like to point out that reality is often ahead of legislation.
I would also like to emphasise that legislation is often not sufficient, but must be supplemented once we have a law.
I would therefore highlight the need for plans regarding equal opportunities and for employer responsibility in a modern society.
Mrs Ghilardotti said that women' s role has changed in the last 25 years, but so has that of men and consequently also working life.
I believe the last remaining bastions will soon be employers and their organisations.
We have talked a great deal about sexual harassment.
This concept is difficult to define, but Swedish lawyers are currently trying to come up with a definition of undesirable, unwelcome behaviour in the workplace by one person towards another.
It is exciting to define phenomena which, though they are old, are only now being highlighted.
We have also talked about paternity leave.
I would like to point out that one does not choose to be a parent - a parent is something you are once you have become one.
When employing new staff, employers ask applicants whether they will become or plan to become parents.
Working life is part of life, not all of it.
This is true for both women and men, as well as for children.
I hope that the vast majority will back Mrs Hautala' s proposal.
Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members of the Bonino List, I announce that we will not be supporting the Hautala report, not, of course, because we are against the principles expounded and the objectives to be attained but because we believe that, increasingly often in the European Institutions, the wrong methods are used to attain fair, acceptable aims and objectives.
It is often done in a bureaucratic way, always in an attempt to draw up a law, a directive or a new imposition.
The 1976 directive played a fundamental role - and I do not want to dwell on this - but the attempt being made today with this report, with this directive, to enhance the implementation of equal opportunities through legal instruments may, I feel, take us down the wrong road, where the benefits run the risk of being more than counterbalanced by the harm done.
The reversal of the burden of proof, for instance, goes against the liberal principles of the rule of law for the sake of the cause to be attained.
The legitimisation of positive actions, for instance, must be tied to an assessment of their duration and of proportionality.
The creation of independent national bodies - this is true in this case but, in my view, it is true in all other cases too - that deal with pre- or para-judicial tasks, would incomprehensibly duplicate traditional means of judicial redress.
With regard to access to the labour market, then, I believe that, first of all (this is true for the Italian situation) some measures must be considered that are wholly conventional - flexibility of the labour market, reviews of social spending, wholly absorbed, for example, by social security spending - measures that would address, and to a great extent are already addressing the issue of equal opportunities in the labour market, but without any need for new laws or new bureaucracies.
Mr President, Mrs Hautala, no one can be against equality between men and women.
However, it is essential that we should know what we are talking about, because it is very difficult to form a clear opinion on your report, since it contains so many statements that are vague, contradictory, or even absurd, like Amendment No 69, according to which it would be better to talk about 'parental leave' for mothers or fathers.
How can we dare talk about equality if we tolerate exceptions such as Amendment No 10 or Amendment No 24?
When we talk about equality, we are recognising the equal dignity of every human being, whether man or woman.
When we talk about equality, we are recognising the special nature of men and women in the organisation of society.
This special nature leads to a complementary relationship between men and women, rather than rivalry.
I can only express my astonishment that this report, at the committee stage, was voted for by women only.
So much for equality!
I should also like to congratulate the men who have had the courage to stand up and speak this morning.
I am also amazed that Amendment No 40 gives associations the right to go to court without making it compulsory to have the consent of the victim in a case of discrimination.
Who are these associations?
Surely it is the role of the state to see that the law is applied, and that it is not distorted?
What exactly are we envisaging for the future?
We must break away from this dialectic which promised us women' s liberation but did not propose anything other than competition with our male partners so that we become superwomen.
We are not clones of men, we are not merely cogs in the production system.
We cannot separate women' s rights from the recognition of woman' s special nature.
Our society is aspiring towards a new feminism.
We are women, wives and mothers.
As women, we want to develop according to our own model, our sensitivity, our intuition and our intelligence.
Man can never be the sole reference for the development of the human being.
As wives, the complementary role of men and women implies the need for cooperation in professional life, in social life and in family life.
As mothers, we hold the future of humanity in our hands, and you are right, Mrs Hautala, when you stress that nothing must be allowed to prevent a woman from giving the gift of life.
So I say yes to equality between men and women, but at the same time, we must respect the special nature and the dignity of both.
Mr President, Commissioner, we have here today a proposal to amend the directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion and working conditions.
The modifications are presented taking into account the Treaty of Amsterdam and the rulings of the Court of Justice in recent years.
The basic idea is to adapt the directive to social reality and to take up the demands of women to solve the problems of different treatment in the workplace.
For the first time it is considered that sexual harassment in the workplace is discrimination on the grounds of sex.
We request preventive measures and measures to help women whose working lives and professional careers are damaged due to sexual harassment.
It should be highlighted that the amendments introduced give support to women regarding pregnancy and maternity, guaranteeing that they can return to their jobs and benefit from any improvements that may have taken place during their absence.
The positive action measures to balance out their representation in the different employment sectors will also be effective.
Women, especially younger women, now have a high level of professional qualifications, but this is not reflected throughout their working lives, as in general they are in lower-qualified posts that do not enable them to fully achieve their professional expectations.
The directive will help solve these problems, but it is the Member States, through their national legislation, which ultimately need to ensure that women can work full-time without their personal or family lives being badly affected as a result.
Those of us who think that we need to support the family know that it is essential to start by supporting women in order to enable them to reconcile family and working life as a principle of Community legislation.
I have to say that it has genuinely been difficult working on this proposal, but we have made an effort to highlight the points of agreement and the objectives of the directive over and above the logical differences between different political groups.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I welcome this reform of the 1996 Equal Treatment Directive and congratulate Mrs Hautala on her truly immense work to achieve a consensus in this House.
The amendment of the directive comes at the right time now that we finally have a sound legal basis in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and it contains more detailed provisions to protect women from discrimination in their professions and in the workplace.
In my view, this is a genuine building block and a contribution to the overall strategy of gender mainstreaming.
With our amendments to the text proposed by the Commission, the directive's scope of application becomes broader and more specific.
We put forward practical definitions of direct and indirect discrimination in the workplace.
For the first time, sexual harassment in the workplace is recognised as discrimination on grounds of sex, and our amendments offer women workers various ways of defending themselves, including recourse to an independent body.
We have also introduced a woman's right to return to her own job or an equivalent job under terms and conditions which are not less favourable to her after maternity leave.
We are again tabling an amendment to protect fathers who apply for parental leave as well.
They are still few in number.
Europe-wide, just 2% of fathers claim this right, and these progressive fathers must not be excluded from our efforts.
I hope that this proposed amendment will be widely supported by this House.
In my view, this too is an essential building block for the gender mainstreaming process.
We Social Democrats want to break open old and entrenched structures and ensure that role stereotypes are no longer perpetuated.
The directive imposes an obligation on Member States to take action against discrimination. It is thus a move away from voluntary, non-binding provisions.
I think that this too will encourage debate about this particular issue in Germany.
The text also calls for the extension of the Equal Treatment Directive to the private sector.
After the cases which we have witnessed, I hope that together, we can now finally make progress for women.
Mr President, in Nordic fashion I am not one to offer undeserved praise, but this time I am happy to read a progressive report with the exact ingredients mentioned by Mrs GrÃ¶ner, i.e. the rights of young men and women to return to working life after parental leave.
I think this is excellent.
One of the key issues is the new regulations on discrimination against women, namely the right to return to work after parental leave.
According to the proposal, an employee or public sector worker is entitled to have their old job back after parental leave, or an equivalent job on terms which are at least as good.
At the same time, any conduct which treats a woman unfairly and which is linked directly or indirectly to pregnancy, motherhood or reconciling family and working life should be forbidden and should constitute direct discrimination.
I have an example from the municipality of Oravais, where I spend the summer.
Here, a permanent employee was forced to resign so that the employment of the person standing in for them could be terminated.
Is this not forbidden, as it is a case of direct discrimination and also a breach of the provision concerning the right to return to work?
The conduct of this municipality is certainly a breach of the future provisions.
The example shows the need for the new directives.
It is important that we have regulations which prevent conduct that discriminates against young women in leading positions in the private or public sectors.
I believe this is one of the key issues, particularly considering how many young women are currently employed in temporary posts.
The legislation would provide protection for them.
There is one point which I hope we can consider further, namely the issue of organisations whose members belong to a particular profession.
Where this issue is concerned, I believe we must look at the link between the two fundamental rights which we find in the legislation of many countries, namely freedom of association and the right to protection against discrimination, that is to say the right to equal opportunities.
I am thinking, for example, of associations of female lawyers, which are close to my heart and which we must ensure we can maintain.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to comment on the extent to which we in this House are still, even today, not entirely in agreement, which is quite a positive point.
To answer the question from the honourable Member of the TDI Group, however, it really is a shame that he can imagine that equality between the sexes should not be subject to legislation.
How can we achieve equality without laws?
I have never known that to happen throughout the entire history of the human race.
I do not see why women should be outside the scope of legislation on equality.
Laws are therefore necessary, and I should like to thank Mrs Hautala most warmly for the work that she has done, by herself and with us, consistently over several weeks, if not months.
I have to say that this work has produced some important results.
Why are they important?
Because in the history of Europe this directive is the most well-known of all the directives on equality between the sexes.
It is the most well-known in all our Member States.
It is therefore extremely important, and I believe that its revision is equally important.
This is why I should have liked to vote in favour of the Amendment No 42 proposed by Mrs Hautala, asking the Commission to make plans for an overall legislative system on the subject of women.
It is time that the various directives were combined, and restructured together.
Besides, there has been a lot of talk about the Treaty of Amsterdam, but one could also mention the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 23 of which stipulates equality between the sexes in all areas, which is a major advance on equality in professional and economic spheres alone.
However, to come back to the subject, as far as this overall approach is concerned, I was anxious that it should include a reference to equal pay, as in the 1975 Directive, and I am pleased to see that it does in fact do so, because it seems to me to be extremely important in the context of equal treatment.
Why is this directive so important?
It is also important for those countries which are candidates for EU enlargement.
We know that working conditions for women in some of the candidate countries have, if anything, become worse since the Berlin Wall came down.
I should like, if possible, to see the revision that we are currently undertaking serve as the basis for discussions with candidate countries from the point of view of enlargement.
However, we can also spread the word in our own Member States as well.
In France we have just adopted a law on equality at work which falls well short of what we are proposing here today.
I hope that our Member States will also be equal to the task that we are proposing here today.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal brings some improvements.
It enhances the protection for employees who file complaints about discrimination.
For the first time, it defines sexual harassment in the workplace as discrimination on grounds of sex, and it recognises the special protection granted to women due to their biological condition.
One thing is clear, and with all our good intentions we must take this into account: all the rights conferred by the directive must be open to scrutiny by the courts, and therefore the employer can also only be held to account if he was informed, for example, about incidents of sexual harassment in the workplace.
There must be scope to include the existing agencies, such as equal opportunities officers or works councils, in the delivery of equal opportunities.
They must be able to act within the terms of the amended directive so that there is no need to set up new bodies at substantial staffing and financial cost.
Monitoring and building on the results achieved is important, but here too, effective record-keeping can be expanded at national level in line with the directive so that the Commission is able to draw up European statistics.
The call for annual equal opportunities reports would impose a disproportionately heavy financial burden on small and medium-sized undertakings.
Women who bear children enjoy special protection in law.
In this respect, a great deal has been achieved in the Member States of the European Union over the years.
The European directive on maternity protection contains clear provisions here.
I do not oppose the inclusion of fathers, quite the contrary.
However, I do oppose the sloppiness of the approach here, and the fact that maternity rights and paternity rights are treated as identical.
There is one minor difference.
Children are born to mothers, not fathers.
By the very nature of things, we must therefore be able to differentiate.
In this respect, the proposal is not very well thought out.
We want equal treatment; we want equal opportunities in society, work and employment. Those are our stated goals.
However, we must be very careful to achieve a balance so that women's jobs remain attractive now and in future.
Mr President, the 1976 directive has proved a powerful weapon in combating discrimination against women in the labour market in Europe.
Today we are dealing with the necessary revision of this directive.
It has turned out, as others have already said, to be a complicated operation, of which the end is not yet in sight, and not everything that has crossed the table is a model of elegant legislation in this respect, but I am hopeful of a successful outcome.
In my view the following three principles should guide us in future and consequently I have three questions to the Commissioner.
Firstly: the legislation on sexual equality, at present scattered over eight directives, should demonstrate legal clarity and coherence and be easier for citizens to understand.
It is doubtful whether the present revision operation will be able to contribute to this aim.
For this reason I should like to ask the Commissioner what she thinks about a codification of existing European legislation on equal treatment of men and women.
Secondly: European legislation on equal treatment should offer an equal level of protection, with as far as possible identical definitions of the concept of discrimination, exceptional provisions, sanctions, etc. Not only for the sake of the principle of equality itself, but mainly with a view to forming a coherent body of law.
Deviations from this principle should be based on the nature of the case itself, for example in relation to pregnancy, or the provisions of the Treaty, as in the case of positive measures.
In the complicated process of legislation this principle is sometimes under pressure, but I assume that the Commissioner shares this view.
I should therefore like to know from her what she can and is prepared to do about this.
Could she, for example, ask her network of legal experts for a comparative study of the legislation as regards the various grounds of discrimination?
My third question to the Commissioner relates to the area in which the equal-treatment legislation will be applied.
This also cries out for further equality.
When can we expect to see legislation already announced several times by the Commissioner, on equal treatment for men and women outside the labour market, and when will she put forward legislative proposals for the various grounds of discrimination?
Sometimes, one may well be surprised that, in the year 2001, we are still forced to discuss equality, for who is actually against equality?
When you then hear certain speakers here, it is obvious that the debate is still all too necessary.
It may well be that there is no-one who wants to speak out against the word equality, but in truth there are many people who are against the introduction of equality in practice, which is, after all, what we are attempting to do with this legislation.
I would like to thank Mrs Hautala for the considerable work that she has put into this legislation, since this is, in fact, an example of how necessary it is to have legislation we can support, if we are to implement equality in practice.
This is, after all, what all the judgements have shown.
I think it is great that Mrs Hautala has been able to draw up a progressive report whilst at the same time succeeding in achieving a broad majority for it.
That is necessary because, after all, 314 people have to vote in favour in order for the report to be adopted.
After all, equality is one of the areas in which the EU still leads the field.
That is something that we women should perhaps point out somewhat more in the public debate when we are discussing the EU in other contexts, and at any rate in contexts in which we face very strong opponents who believe that the EU does nothing whatsoever for its citizens.
This is, of course, an outstanding example of the EU actually doing something for its citizens and being way ahead of the field, even compared with the Scandinavian countries.
We can really describe it as a case of a very positive synergy effect between the Member States and the Commission.
The proposal deals, of course, with various matters, including sexual harassment and matters related to childbirth, but also with opportunities for fathers.
I think it is very good that we have managed to bring fathers more into focus, for if we are really to have equality then it is crucial for men also to become involved to a greater extent.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, achieving genuine equality for women and men is one of the most important social and political tasks.
Women still suffer discrimination in the labour market.
Women still earn less than men.
Women are under-represented in senior management.
Throughout Europe, unemployment is higher among women than men.
Mrs Hautala's report is an important contribution to equal opportunities.
However, I believe that the directive should take more aspects of women's working lives into account.
The proposed reform does not go far enough.
For example, it fails to provide regulations on equal employment conditions for women.
Women must have equal pay for work of equal value!
We need targeted re-integration measures after career breaks.
I work actively to ensure that women and men have equal opportunities in every area of society.
I urge the Council and the Commission to adopt measures to achieve these objectives.
Mr President, the directive at present under discussion aims to adapt the existing 1976 directive to the social and economic developments of recent years.
I congratulate the Commission on its initiative in adapting the legislation in this area to these developments at European level and also in giving new impetus.
The directive must be seen in combination with the recommendation on child care, the directive on parental leave and the directive that lays down minimum conditions for the improvement of the safety and health of pregnant women at work, and with the directive that we discussed last year on the basis of Article 13 and on which we approved a report.
Mr President, in many countries and situations women are still disadvantaged and discriminated against.
The combination of work and care still presents problems in many cases, not only for women but also for men wishing to combine work and care.
As yet few men, by the way, take parental leave: according to the most recent data in Denmark, for example, the figure is seven men to one hundred women, in France one to one hundred, and in Germany two to a hundred.
I therefore welcome the amendments focusing on these measures to protect pregnancy and motherhood to be supplemented with measures relating to fatherhood.
Mrs Van der Laan, my sentiments are shared by many other women in the Christian-Democrat group.
Another problem, Mr President, is sexual harassment.
This occurs more frequently than we would like in work situations.
The report makes proposals on combating and preventing such intimidation.
Last year I was draftsperson of my committee' s opinion on the directive on Article 13. This has close points of contact with the directive at present before us.
I pointed out at that time the important role of confidants.
That need not be a person specially assigned for the purpose - anyway, that is infeasible in smaller organisations - but someone in the organisation who enjoys wide trust and acts as a someone to whom staff can talk.
I also argued for an independent body to deal with complaints.
I support the amendments that would facilitate this.
The report also has an inescapable impact for employers, for example report writing and returning to the same job.
I believe that we can provide a good impetus and at the same time make acceptable demands on employers.
Mr President, in my brief contribution I should like to concentrate on one important novelty in the directive and in Mrs Hautala' s excellent report, namely intimidation on the basis of sex.
Various surveys have shown that many hundreds of thousands of employees, predominantly women, encounter this, with all the adverse consequences for their health and their career.
I should like to remind honourable Members that for that reason three years ago the ETUC was already advocating collective negotiations in order to tackle this problem, but sadly the employers' organisation persistently refused.
It is therefore necessary and useful that legislators should now act.
I am therefore glad, Commissioner, that in the proposal sexual harassment is seen as a form of discrimination based on sex.
I believe that the sanctioning approach of the European Commission is good, but perhaps insufficient.
For that reason the European Parliament would be well advised to provide an efficient prevention policy, as was provided for at the time in the code of conduct accompanying the recommendation of 1991 on the protection of the dignity of men and women at work.
We believe that employers too should take responsibility for ensuring that no sexual harassment occurs in the work environment.
In Belgium Minister Onkelinx recently presented a bill, under which each company must draw up a prevention plan and appoint a prevention consultant.
I consider that a good approach that can be safely followed in Europe.
Accordingly I hope that this directive, in its present form, with the amendments made by our committee, can be approved under the Belgian presidency.
Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hautala on this report.
Europe has a long tradition of fighting for equal rights for men and women.
The position of women particularly was very important: equal pay for equal work, equal treatment by social security, independent rights in pensions and social security and a number of regulations relating to the combination of work and care.
Today' s legislation sets a new milestone.
The proposal gives a new content to the principal of discrimination, which issues from the Treaty of Amsterdam, but certainly also from the judgements of the Court of Justice, which has always been a fighter for women' s rights.
For the first time at European level the concept of sexual harassment has been given a clear content.
Sexual harassment is a violation of the principle of equality between men and women and also violates the dignity of men and women.
It is better to tackle this problem now.
With regard to the content given to the principle of discrimination I am grateful to the rapporteur that my amendment, which was intended to broaden the concept by including alongside the workplace admission to work and to a profession, as well as the training and education which lead to a position, was immediately accepted.
I should like to express my annoyance at the fuss just made by Mrs Van der Laan.
She devoted a part of her allotted speaking time to saying: It was my idea. I, Mrs Van der Laan, came up with the idea that men too and parenthood must be discussed.
Mrs Van der Laan, if you had paid better attention, you would have known that that idea would at any rate have obtained a majority in our group.
So I think that in that respect voting behaviour will show that there is no great opposition.
In conclusion, discrimination is often connected with gender.
The only problem I still have concerns the concept of foster-parenthood, for which there is there is no legal basis.
I wonder if we should not provide one.
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are extending the borders of equal treatment to all aspects of women' s working life, which means not only employment, but also the whole training and career cycle and working conditions.
Insofar as equality between men and women is an objective and also a mission for the European Union, we need to adapt, update and also think up new strategies, new legislative texts that will enable us to complete this task effectively.
The article on sexual harassment should be highlighted, and I will not expand on this point as it has already been sufficiently highlighted.
It is also important, in my opinion, to define direct and indirect discrimination, and to establish positive action as a tool for balancing out inequalities, a transitory tool until equality is achieved.
From the start, the European Community has aimed to eradicate unequal treatment, but unfortunately today there are still blatant inequalities in this area on which I will not expand either.
An international organisation has said that, at the pace things are moving, we could achieve equality in four or five centuries, and I do not think that any of us here are prepared to wait such a long time.
We need to intervene with positive measures such as this in order to change an order that is profoundly unfair and that is contrary to the development of our societies.
The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities has done a rigorous and comprehensive job, which substantially improves the Commission' s proposal.
I congratulate everyone on this, especially Mrs Hautala.
Mr President, my congratulations to the Commission and to the rapporteur.
I agree with what many honourable Members have said and so will limit myself to a few points.
When I look at my own country - since I believe everyone is exploring what the impact will be on their own country - I see three crucial points.
Firstly, the annual report on the equal treatment of men and women that is required from companies in this directive.
I introduced that in my own country.
It is encountering huge resistance and has never been complied with, although it is compulsory.
Secondly, positive action.
That also remains a very difficult matter, even with women.
Thirdly, equal pay.
Numerous ways have been found of getting round equal pay.
What I am actually trying to say with these three examples is that if we want to succeed in implementation in the area of this directive, which I think is a good one, we may perhaps have to talk more with the social partners than we have done in the past.
Only if they support things on the ground and cooperate in trying to carry them out, will anything change at grass-roots level.
Take the example of equal pay.
At a time of recession, the response is: 'We can' t have completely equal pay, that' s too expensive' .
But it does not happen in boom times either.
I believe that more pressure should be applied on them, particularly since we all accept they are primarily responsible for the labour market.
Then I would like to say something briefly about sexual harassment.
Some fifteen years ago, I launched a campaign in Belgium under the title "Sex colleague, ex-colleague" .
Since then legislation has been devised, confidants have been assigned, a network of confidants has been set up, and those confidants have been trained.
I must say that it actually works quite well and is also supported by the social partners.
Mr President, Mrs Hautala, Commissioner, I am very pleased to see that so many members have referred to the amendments relating to the position of parents - particularly young parents.
Motherhood, pregnancy and fatherhood must not prevent progress in working life.
I find Amendment No 25 to be particularly welcome and well-justified.
Reference has already been made here to the fact that childbearing tends to be postponed in periods of economic prosperity, and this is particularly worrying as far as young women are concerned.
I also think that Amendment No 42 is good, i.e. referring to this problem of equal pay, which in my opinion is still the worst problem in Europe in terms of gender equality.
It is completely intolerable that even today in many sectors, even in the public sector, the average earnings of women are lower than those of men with equivalent education and experience.
Our society and our economy cannot afford not to exploit to the full the skills of its entire population.
Our society must offer all its members equal and unlimited opportunities for self-development along their chosen path.
Old-fashioned and artificial structures must not be allowed to impede an individual' s professional, educational or career development or personal growth, irrespective of their gender.
Sexual harassment is a repugnant phenomenon.
I would like to emphasis that the natural human dignity and integrity of the individual are inviolable basic values, particularly to us conservatives.
Sexual harassment, this subject on which silence has reigned for so long, must be efficiently tackled.
However, there is cause to take action at European Union level only where we are unable to create sufficient legislation at national level.
On this issue I am of the opinion that healthy social structures and efficient national legislation are the best means of preventing sexual harassment.
European Union legislation must also comply with the general legal requirements for legislation.
A text worded clearly, accurately and in detail is one of these.
When bringing their own case in court people must be able to base their demands on a clear legal text.
In this respect I support Ms Lulling' s opinion that this report is not sufficiently legally precise throughout.
Furthermore, I would like to say that I absolutely oppose Amendment No 40, which refers to collective action being adopted in this sector.
While I am not of the opinion that this would be a bad thing in this sector in particular, I do object in general to the collective action mechanism being brought into the European legal system.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala and all the members of the committee involved in this very complicated operation.
First, the European Union has proposed a combination of political tools to add value in line with the policy of equal opportunities, such as its legislation, the Fifth Programme, employment strategy, the guidelines, the mainstreaming policies, the social funds, and so on.
Legislation is one of the most important and effective political tools and there is no need to continually propose new legislation.
We must modernise the existing legislation and adapt and adjust it to a world of change.
This is what we have attempted to do, taking into account new models of production, the family and society.
We have taken into account the new treaty and the new legal basis and, of course, we have taken into account the case law of the Court of Justice.
I would like to briefly answer some of the questions put.
First, on codification: Yes, we are going to present our work on codification of legislation on the same legal basis.
Second, there is an expert group which meets three times per year and they examine the problems of compatibility between European and national legislation.
Thirdly, I was asked whether we are going to continue with new directives going beyond the employment field.
We are committed to doing that and proposals will be made next year.
As far as sexual harassment is concerned, we have accepted as many of the proposals as possible.
There was excellent cooperation between the committee and the Commission and I really believe that agreement can be reached on this proposal at the Employment and Social Affairs Council on 11 June.
It is very important to reach this agreement at this Council so that we can move to final adoption during the Belgian presidency.
I am obliged to refer to each amendment and to explain why they are rejected or accepted, so allow me to read out exactly what the Commission's position is.
It is very important to say that the Commission can accept 49 of the 69 amendments, although we would prefer a different wording for 17 of them and can only accept 17 of these amendments in part.
I support Amendments Nos 7 and 21, which provide for definitions of direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment in one article.
The Commission can also accept, in principle, part of Amendments Nos 39 and 68, which extend the powers of independent bodies to cover all directives in the area of equality of treatment between women and men.
However, the Commission cannot accept the part of Amendment No 39, which provides for funding and human resources for these bodies.
Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept that these bodies could examine and pursue complaints for individuals and organisations without the consent of these individuals or groups.
Amendments Nos 15 and 40 in part would allow law organisations and associations to take cases on behalf of a complainant.
The Commission can only accept this in cases of approval or consent of the complainant.
The spirit of Amendment No 10 and part of Amendments Nos 25, 46 and 69 stress the importance of the reconciliation of family and working life and call for complementary action on paternity leave.
We can accept Amendments Nos 12 and 38 on the protection of victims of discrimination, including employees and trade union delegates against any adverse treatment.
Amendment No 33 clarifies that the application of the principle of equal treatment concerning membership of, and involvement in, an organisation should not ban organisations of a single sex.
The Commission never intended such a ban.
We also accept: Amendments Nos 14 and 42 urging Member States to encourage employers to establish annual equality plans in order to promote equal treatment; Amendment No 41, encouragement of dialogue with non-governmental organisations having an interest in promoting equality of opportunity.
The Commission cannot accept part of Amendments Nos 11, 27 nor Amendment No 55 insofar as they introduce a definition of positive action into the text of the directive itself.
This definition of positive action is already contained in the text of treaty and therefore should not be part of the directive.
However, the Commission could agree to a reference to Declaration 28 of the Treaty, which provides for priority for women in positive action measures in the recitals and in the text of the directive.
The Commission can accept part of the rest of Amendments Nos 11 and 27, the establishment of reports on positive action every two years but not annual reports and not linked to the employment process.
This would be unrealistic and over-complicated.
I cannot accept Amendment No 1 and parts of various other amendments, which replace "equal treatment between women and men" with "equality for women and men".
This would be incompatible with the wording of the Treaty.
This is the major issue; it is not a question of political differences or an ideological problem.
We must use the wording of the Treaty and the wording of the Treaty is "equality of treatment for men and women".
The Commission can accept the latter wording.
Other amendments that the Commission rejects are part of Amendments No 9 and 59 as a matter of principle since they refer to the need to amend another Community directive on equal treatment relating to maternity.
A directive cannot provide for future modification of another directive which concerns health and safety at the workplace.
Nor can it accept Amendment No 4, which refers to the necessity for the Commission to make proposals on the basis of Article 13 to cover areas beyond employment, occupational and vocational training.
Such a provision cannot be contained in a directive, which does not go beyond these fields.
But as I have already said, we are going to propose measures in 2002.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 36 and 61 which extend judicial protection to all cases where discrimination takes place after termination of the employment relationship.
This goes beyond the scope of the directive.
Amendment No 44 which provides for contractual compliance with respect to equal treatment, particularly in the public procurement context, goes beyond the scope of the directive, but we have discussed it with the committee in the past and I have explained to you that there is cooperation between me and Mr Bolkestein.
We are going to issue a communication and support and encourage Member States to take this into account.
Finally, as you can see, the Commission can accept most of Parliament's amendments.
I would highlight our acceptance of Amendments Nos 7 and 21, definitions of direct and indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment and Amendment No 39 in part, scope of powers of independent bodies.
I accept in spirit Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 20, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 51 and 60 and partially Amendments Nos 5 and 9, first part in spirit, Amendment No 11, first part, Amendment Nos 12, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 30, 39, 40, 43 (second part), 46 (second part), 50 (second part) and 69 (second part).
Many amendments could be accepted in full such as Amendments Nos 13, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29, 31, 41, 42, 45, 47, 60, 66 and 68.
However, I reject Amendments Nos 1, 4, 36, 43 (first part) and Amendments Nos 44, 48, 49, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65 and 67.
This was the first time that the Women's Committee had participated in the codecision procedure.
It was a first experience and a very successful one, because such complicated work has had excellent results.
I would like to congratulate you.
I would like to thank you for your cooperation so that we can have this directive in place as soon as possible.
Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Integrated European labour market 1998-1999
The next item is the report (A5-0169/2001) by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's EURES activity report 1998-1999 entitled 'Towards an integrated European labour market: the contribution of EURES' [COM(2000) 607 - C5-0104/2001 - 2001/2053(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although EURES was created in 1993, as the successor to the old SEDOC, few people are even aware that it exists.
Few people know what EURES does, which is to help people looking for work in another Union country or employers to recruit applicants in another country.
Few people understand what EURES could mean for the future.
Our first recommendation, therefore, seeks to publicise EURES and its database more intensively, which must be reflected in its budget, in its activity plan and in the implementation of its budget and also in the various Member States, where it should be monitored and followed up appropriately by their public employment services, which are now linked by means of EURES.
EURES is a network of networks, consisting of around 500 'Euroadvisers' , public and private organisations and partners and provides a valuable opportunity for direct consultation via the Internet in an open network.
It seeks to promote the transparency of the European market by providing information, advice and placement help.
EURES covers not only the Union, but also the European Economic Area and currently includes 17 countries.
In short, it seeks to promote the effective exercise of the right to free movement of workers and encourage mobility, which we consider not to be a political end in itself, but rather the need to respond to people' s spontaneous requests.
All of this makes little sense, however, if people are fundamentally unaware of its existence.
The first priority is, therefore, to promote and to publicise this programme.
As a matter of fact, as a result of growing Internet use, the efficiency of EURES will increasingly depend on the widespread knowledge of the general public and much less on simple improvements to the workings of the bureaucratic network of services and organisations.
One specific sector of EURES deserves a special mention, which is the area dedicated to cross-border cooperation in the field of employment and labour mobility, and which clearly generates a higher level of response: the cross-border EURES.
Today, there are already twenty specific structures in this field, but a great deal remains to be done.
I would remind you, in particular, of the case of my country' s border with Spain, which is largely 'bare' , and I am also thinking of the new challenges and opportunities that the forthcoming enlargement will bring to this field.
As a result of the considerable potential that these EURES cross-border structures offer in terms of local development, decentralised social dialogue and specific development of cross-border mobility, being able to work in another country without changing residence is clearly another priority for the future.
If we look at the 1998-1999 period, which the Commission' s report covers, we see positive data that we have highlighted. The report also contains some negative aspects to bear in mind, which we must correct straightaway.
These include the considerable lack of public awareness, to which I have already referred, the low take-up in relative terms by employers' organisations, the very high national imbalance in the participation of the various Member States, a fact which is disturbing and unacceptable, some shortcomings that have been noticed with regard to the web site, specifically in terms of its multilingual nature, which serves to provide an equal basis for all European citizens, and the absence of any mention of the outermost regions. We therefore also request that particular attention be paid in future to these regions' specific problems in this field.
In our opinion, the Commission' s report itself contains some shortcomings, which we have highlighted.
These are the absence of any diagnosis and a lack of assessment of the crux of the matter, in terms both of the development of the service itself and of the true state of labour mobility in the Union and the European Economic Area.
The future reports by EURES will be much more useful and will make much more political sense if they present their critical vision of the successes and failures that have been notched up, if they include information which is more relevant, both in terms of statistics and of quality, if they better enable us to make a more accurate assessment of the definition of priorities of future goals and targets and if they also enable us to undertake a proper parliamentary assessment of the reasons underpinning the choices that are made.
