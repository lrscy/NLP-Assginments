As MEPs, we had a duty, in fact, to review the financial regulation, and this for several reasons.
It was becoming urgent to reform it.
To prove this, I only need mention the various problems that we have had to tackle as representatives of the people of Europe, especially where providing Europeans with information was concerned.
We need to be better at communicating with people and to communicate with them more often.
Reviewing the financial regulation is one way of doing this.
The lump-sum payments with regard to procurement procedures and to the award of grants are to be welcomed as a step in the direction of better financial management.
The same goes, moreover, for the protection of the Communitiesâ financial interests, to be achieved, by the amendment tabled in relation to the recovery, suspension and implementation of contracts and penalties.
I am thinking, in particular, of the amendments concerning the simplification measures.
The challenge for us is to strike a balance between simplification and sound financial management.
I welcome the approach of the rapporteur and the draftsman, aimed at making the rules simpler for the beneficiaries, thanks in particular to the simplification of administrative procedures and the simultaneous tightening of controls on the way in which our budget is spent.
We must provide the resources for an ongoing dialogue with civil society and not discriminate between organisations â between those that have the resources to respond to Community programmes and those that do not.
The report will in fact make it possible to safeguard Parliamentâs rights in the future, whether in terms of its power of control or of its right to information in its capacity as a branch of the budgetary authority.
Similarly, I should like to point out that the provisions concerning the funding of political groups or political parties are of the utmost importance.
We are concerned here, in actual fact, with the formation of European citizenship, a citizenship to which Parliament must contribute in order to ensure the development of the European public space.
Â Â  Mr President, I am addressing the twenty practically heroic Members who are here during this night sitting.
It is shameful that we have to discuss such important issues at night.
Our fellow Members decided that there was no need for Friday sittings, and here we are, at an inappropriate time, which is not worthy of the quality and dignity of our parliamentary work.
I will say secondly that we must congratulate MrsÂ GrÃ€Ãle on her good work and say that this Parliament is obliged to ensure that the money that the citizens give us is not wasted on administrative costs and that it arrives on time and effectively, and that is the intention of Mrs GrÃ€Ãleâs report.
There are two different philosophies here, and I am delighted that the majority of speakers share this new philosophy â which is different to the one in place when I came to this Parliament four terms in office ago â the philosophy of believing that we must get the best from the people who work on the administration of the budget and that we must establish responsibilities.
The political position of imposing bureaucracy on spending is born of distrust in our civil servants, of we politicians not wanting to run any kind of risk.
The idea is to get rid of civil servants who make mistakes, and we therefore tell them that, each time they have to buy a pencil, they must follow a long procedure in order to assure us that the pencil has been purchased properly.
We do not permit the tiniest error, and there have been cases of our getting rid of civil servants who have done things right many times, but who have made a mistake just once.
The philosophy of making the spending procedure less complicated is therefore going to allow Community money, which the Council rations more and more â it is only going to give us 1%, rather than 1.2% â to arrive more efficiently and on time, because there are plenty of examples of Community money reaching the taxpayer, the European citizen, late and inefficiently as a result of our Rules of Procedure and our lack of responsibility as politicians.
Thank you very much for this excellent report, MrsÂ GrÃ€Ãle.
Â Â  The revision of the Communityâs âfinancial bibleâ affects not only the institutional framework of the European Union but also its citizens.
The rapporteur, MrsÂ GrÃ€ssle, has done an excellent job in dealing with the Commissionâs draft, and we now have an excellent proposal before us.
I am going to focus on those points that I find most substantive.
We must clearly define the tasks and joint responsibilities of the Member States regarding management of the Communityâs financial resources.
In respect of structural funds, and in the interest of transparency, reliability, efficiency and theÂ good reputation of the European Union in the eyes of its citizens, we must put in place transparent and expeditious administrative procedures with clearly defined responsibilities for the individual actors.
The same applies to public procurement. Ambiguities and unnecessary procedural delays often occur in this area as well.
As a former mayor, I have had negative personal experiences in this respect.
I believe that by approving this document we will contribute to the better functioning of the financial system in the European Union and thus make the activities of the EU easier for its citizens to comprehend.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to make three points.
Firstly, I wish to express my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur, MrsÂ GrÃ€Ãle, who has done a tremendous job, a great job.
We can only congratulate her on this achievement.
Secondly, if there is any point to this work, then surely it is that it represents an attempt to improve the efficiency of the administration of our programmes and our funds.
This also means, however, that the Commissionâs work should be increasingly judged by its efficiency in future.
The significance of this to future discharge procedures in this House is that we shall have to change our methods and start to move away from a know-it-all attitude towards the application of more efficient standards.
Thirdly, as a Member coming from a small Alpine region, I expect the Commission â including in the context of the oft-heralded transparency initiatives â to provide information on the average size of the companies participating in the European programmes, the average size of the small or medium-sized enterprises benefiting from European funds, for example, and the length of time, in the final reckoning, for which an enterprise has to provide pre-financing in order to receive European funds.
That, too, is very important as regards the future assessment of the Commissionâs work and of the implementation of European programmes.
Â Â  Mr President, at the close of this debate stretching into the night, I would like to say a few words as the President of the committee involved, COCOBU, and as a MEP of a new Member State.
MEPs of the new Member States have participated in the parliamentary preparations for the Financial Regulation with great joy and enthusiasm, not only because they have an enthusiastic commitment to parliamentary work, but also because they are convinced that we serve a better, simpler and more effective Europe.
This is because our experience of almost two years has shown us that the financial regulation of the European Union is often over-bureaucratised and anti-productive.
Changing this situation is not only in the interest, but also the duty of all of us.
In awareness of this, all Members of Parliament involved in this process have cooperated with one another, showing a good example; the two committees reinforced their cooperation and appointed two excellent rapporteurs, and then, starting from the organisation of the public hearing to the voting, they did everything they could to achieve a result.
We trust that the Commission and Council will follow this good example as soon as possible, in the interest of the common and good new Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by SeÃ¡n Ã Neachtain, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on more environmentally friendly fishing methods (2004/2199(INI)) (A6-0019/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, I will start my presentation on promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods by reminding Parliament that in recent times fishermen collectively have been seriously under attack.
Because of illegal actions by the few, there is a growing public perception that collectively fishermen are all potential criminals.
I say to colleagues and especially to you, Commissioner, that this has to stop.
Are there dishonest people in the fisheries sector?
Of course there are, just like in every other sector â economic or otherwise â known to man.
If someone is guilty of criminal activity then let the full force of the appropriate law apply.
On the other hand, we must put a stop to the insidious branding of the entire fisheries profession with the same brush of dishonesty.
We must never forget that the great majority of men and women involved in the sector are honest, dedicated and extremely hard-working people.
Furthermore, no meaningful change can be achieved without the active involvement and participation of those honest fishermen and women.
In recent years the key challenge to maintaining sustainable fisheries has, to a large extent, developed into an overly simplistic and polarising debate on whether or not we should have more or less fishing.
In reality the challenge of rebuilding stocks and maintaining sustainability is also about developing new and better ways of fishing through the utilisation and development of new technology.
The objective of maintaining sustainability must, most centrally, embrace the question of how we fish in the future so that we harvest our marine resources in the most environmentally favourable way.
The introduction of fishing practices that reduce adverse impacts on our ecosystems is a priority.
To achieve that we must first understand the effects of fishing practices on the marine environment and promote fishing activities that are environmentally sustainable.
I am particularly pleased that the last Irish Presidency proposed the initiative of a major EU programme to make fishing activity more environmentally friendly in order to help to build European fish stocks.
This is an urgent matter.
The urgency is clearly illustrated by one extraordinary statistic: 20 million tonnes of fish are being discarded worldwide every year, equivalent to about one quarter of total world catches.
In the words of the then Irish Presidency, over-fishing is part of the overall problem; but taking that amount of fish out of the seas and then throwing it overboard is shockingly wasteful and has to be substantially reduced in the short term.
I am sure that you will agree with me that we are going nowhere unless that happens, and that we must do something positive about it.
It is gratifying that we in the European Union are prepared to take the lead to tackle that worldwide problem and deal with such a wasteful side-effect of the fishing industry.
The proposed environmental programme includes a review of all existing technical conservation measures within the next two years, to reduce ecosystem and environmental damage.
It includes the proposal to fast-track the development of more selective fishing gear.
It proposes the simplification of our current rules with a view to facilitating those changes.
I started my presentation in defence of fishermen.
I conclude my presentation by underlining that it is our fishermen and women who will have a central role in deciding the future of the European fishing industry.
Fishermen and women will have their say in this process through their regional advisory councils, which will have an extremely important role to play.
There is no doubt in my mind that fishermen will fully subscribe to this new environmentally friendly approach.
They will do so because it will contribute to sustainable fisheries.
They will do so because it will contribute to improving fish stocks.
They will do so because it will ensure that fish stocks are properly preserved for future generations.
Commissioner, if you want this programme to work then you must ensure that there are proposals for financial and other incentives, including additional quota entitlements to encourage fishermen to move towards more selective and more environmentally friendly fishing gear.
I hope that you will agree with me, Commissioner, that in the current context that will be a small price to pay.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Ã Neachtain, and the Committee on Fisheries for the constructive report on more environmentally friendly fishing methods and for the interest they have shown in the communication from the Commission.
I cannot agree more with what the rapporteur has just said regarding the honesty and integrity of fishermen; the abuses of the few should not be blamed on everyone at large and we need to clamp down strongly on the real culprits.
The Commission attaches great importance to the development of more environmentally friendly fishing methods.
Improving selectivity is one of the objectives of the technical measures that we propose in that context.
In that regard, I am pleased to note that some progress has been achieved on the technical measures in the Baltic that were adopted by the Council in December, and the Commission intends to increase selectivity and the new technical measures to be proposed for the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic and North Sea.
I have noted your interest in combating ghost fishing.
The Commission is prepared to be at the forefront of this battle.
Following the Deepnet report, measures were decided, in the last TAC and in the quota regulation for 2006, to ban temporarily deepwater gillnet fishery in the areas covered by the report and concerned by this activity until such time as permanent measures â also applicable to other areas, in lieu of a complete ban â are adopted, hopefully, during this year.
I have also reserved funds to support retrieval surveys of ghost nets.
The Commission will continue to follow these issues with particular attention.
The reduction of discards will be a major objective of the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea.
It needs to be underscored that, due to the variety of the catch composition and the level of discards in European Union waters, the regional aspects of the different fisheries will be taken into account.
The various areas to be considered will correspond to the spheres of influence of the different RACs, thereby incorporating more easily the proposals made by those councils, a positive evaluation being made by the relevant RAC.
The Commission is encouraging the industry to engage in pilot programmes by making use of the RACs for this purpose.
Two such pilot projects have already been carried out in France and Sweden.
Further pilot projects, in full cooperation with the industry, will allow us to test on a case-by-case basis possible measures to reduce discards effectively.
The Commission is also encouraging the development of efforts in fisheries management in the Kattegat in cooperation with Denmark, Sweden and Germany.
This will hopefully lead to positive results later this year.
This kind of management, among other objectives, is aimed at reducing or eliminating discards.
Bycatch reduction is linked to selectivity and discard issues and, at international level, the Commission has promoted a global approach for bycatch issues within the FAO.
This could result in an international plan of action on bycatch reduction and/or technical guidelines elaborated by the FAO.
Most of the measures to promote environmentally friendly fishing methods will be included in the new technical measures for the Atlantic and the North Sea.
As you know, technical measures are considered as a complement to effort limitations, TACs and quotas, long-term management and recovery plans, and as part of the overall package of management measures.
I have noted your request to simplify the regulatory system and can inform you that these new technical measures will be a fundamental test case in the simplification programme led by the Commission.
They are one of the principal points of the action plan on simplification.
Turning to the amendments: with regard to Amendment 1 on centralisation and co-management, the Commission would like to see substantial RAC involvement in the elaboration of technical measures without, however, any change to the decision-making process.
The Commission agrees with taking into account initiatives of RACs so as to improve fisheries management and can accept that point on condition that the positive effects of such measures are confirmed by scientific assessment.
I would like to emphasise that we already have examples to illustrate that the Commission takes into account proposals from the RACs, such as the case of the French square-meshed panel, the Swedish grid and the proposed new rule under which â for safety reasons â the cod line is to be placed as far as ten metres, instead of one metre, away from the meshes of the cod end when using an onboard pump system in pelagic fisheries.
It is premature to give a definitive reaction to Amendment 2, since discussions on depleted fish stocks are still under way.
They will hopefully be concluded by April.
However, the draft proposal from the Commission already provides for socio-economic compensation linked to recovery plans, and I can assure you that this topic will be given the necessary attention.
Â Â  Mr President, let me first of all warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ã Neachtain, for a brilliant own-initiative report on introducing environmentally friendly fishing methods to the EU fisheries sector.
He has produced a very fitting conclusion to an initiative that, as he reminded us, was first started by the Irish Presidency.
I agree with him and I agree with the Commissioner on the need to decriminalise honest fishermen.
That is a crucial point that he brought out in his presentation.
However, his report stresses two other points that I want to expand upon.
First of all, there is the need for the Commission to take a more wide-ranging view of measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild depleted fish stocks, in particular by studying factors other than over-fishing that may cause fish stocks to be depleted, such as pollution and global warming.
As you know, Commissioner, there is mounting evidence that over-fishing has not been the only cause of the collapse of cod stocks in the North Sea.
If that was so, the dramatic reduction in the number of fishing vessels that are now fishing for cod in the North Sea â numbers have collapsed by 60% through decommissioning in the last five years â would have led to a remarkable recovery in cod stocks, but that has not been the case.
It seems to me that the other factors â such as global warming or pollution or whatever other factors may be evident â should now be the basis of your review of the cod recovery programme, which I am delighted that you have agreed to carry out.
Indeed, the other point from Mr Ã Neachtainâs report that I want to emphasise is the point he strongly made on discards, when he emphasised that over 20Â million tons of fish are discarded worldwide every year.
One million tons are discarded in Europe every year.
Commissioner, you said that two pilot projects were already under way.
I thought you were also carrying out pilot projects in the North Sea.
If you have any further information on the pilot projects and evidence concerning discards and how this may be tackled in the future I would very much like to hear it in your winding-up speech.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Ã Neachtain on his excellent report.
Our group is satisfied with the report and we also support the two amendments tabled.
The report is very timely.
Last month, it became public knowledge that a number of deep-sea fish are threatened with exhaustion and even extinction.
There are no two ways about it: the fish stocks are in a desperate fix and a change of tack towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly fisheries is desperately needed, and affects us all.
Let me begin by saying that fishermen will need to adjust to the depletion of fish stocks.
While there is a need for technical measures, such as acoustic deterring devices, electric impulses which will render the disturbance of the sea bed unnecessary, adequate mesh sizes and fish hooks in order to minimise bycatch, non-technical measures are at least equally important.
I am mainly concerned about preventing illegal fishing and introducing marine reserves so as to replenish fish populations.
This sounds simple, but it is an unfortunate fact that it is not.
Our group stresses the need for fishermen to be encouraged to apply sustainable methods.
The fisheries sector is having a tough time, not least due to increasing oil prices.
In this light, we need an active and involved government in order to promote sustainable fishing.
The governments must also stand surety for control and enforcement.
Illegal fishing renders the situation impossible for all parties.
Without effective control measures, this situation will irrevocably lead to a tragedy of common sense.
Everyone stands to lose and soon there will be no fish left to catch.
Thirdly, consumers must also be involved in sustainable fishing.
Many consumers wish to buy well-caught fish, but they do not know which of the fish is sustainable.
Certification and quality marks are therefore important.
Sustainable fish is, first and foremost, fish that is not overfished, without unnecessary bycatch and discards, and good information to consumers is needed in this respect.
Only then will consumers take an informed decision in favour of sustainably caught fish.
Finally, in order to make a change of tack possible, we as politicians must shoulder our responsibility.
We must constantly draw the attention to sustainable fishing and we must act; we must respond to the fishermen who make the temporary introduction of marine reserves possible, thus ensuring that they do not lose their incomes in the short term.
The report that is before us constitutes a few sound steps in that direction and these must be fleshed out in the near future.
Needless to say, the fishing industry must be involved in the measures.
Only with responsible politicians and active government, innovative fishermen and involved consumers can both the fishing industry and the fish look forward to a sustainable future.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the ALDE Group congratulates Mr Ã Neachtain on his report.
It is clear and succinct and yet comprehensive in its coverage of the issues.
We particularly endorse the references to biodiversity and to the need for action in relation both to ghost fishing and discards, as well as the call for the Commission to continue to promote the adoption of an FAO International Plan of Action on bycatch reduction.
On ghost fishing, we stressed the importance of monitoring the existing transitional measure, to ensure that it is not simply leading to displacement of effort, and the importance of the full involvement of the European Parliament in discussions relating to long-term controls.
We entirely agree with the reportâs emphasis on the role that regional advisory councils can play in the promotion of environmentally friendly fishing methods and with the necessity of affording them increased technical and financial support.
We regret that we cannot vote for either of the amendments.
Whilst we sympathise with the approach expressed in Amendment 1, particularly on decentralisation and co-management, we have difficulties with some of the wording and feel that the points are effectively addressed in paragraph 19.
In the same way we believe that the issue of compensation, as raised in Amendment 2, is already adequately covered by the existing paragraph 6.
In conclusion, we commend the report to the Commission, the Council and Parliament as a whole.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Ã Neachtain, and assure him of my full support for his report, which I hope will be adopted unamended.
I know of no one with any interest whatsoever in fisheries who would not support the principle of environmentally friendly fishing methods: the people with most to gain, after all, from protecting the marine environment and ensuring a balance between conservation and harvesting of fish stocks are the fishermen themselves.
Most of the fishermen I know are not just fishing for today but are hoping that, one day, their families will be able to follow them into the business.
However, there is much more to environmental protection than just technical measures, important as they will always be.
The CFP itself, I would contend, is not environmentally friendly: TACs and quotas measure not the amount of fish caught but only the fish landed.
Discards are by the CFP, rather than prevented by it.
Many people in Scotlandâs fisheries-dependent communities are totally disillusioned with the European Unionâs management of fisheries; so much so that, today, the Scottish Parliamentâs European Committee considered a petition based on 250Â 000 signatures calling for withdrawal from the CFP.
The Scottish Parliament agreed to ask for legal advice on this.
That was not done lightly, but because there is a real and serious need for more radical reform than we have had thus far.
Â Â  . â I should first like to commend the rapporteur on his openness and his focus in the course of drawing up his report, which we broadly endorse and which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries.
There is no doubt that the sustainability of fisheries resources is crucial to the long-term survival and viability of the fisheries sector.
The sustainability of resources needs to be based on a wide-ranging approach to measures to protect the marine environment and to rebuild depleted stocks, in which other factors such as coastal and offshore pollution, industrial and agricultural effluents, deep-sea dredging and maritime transport are also taken on board.
This sustainability should also be based on technical measures arising from scientific fishing research, in particular via the implementation of closed seasons, prohibited zones and mesh size regulations.
That being said, we feel that fisheries management policies should not be used to penalise this strategically valuable activity, which is of vital economic and social importance.
It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between meeting social and economic needs and environmental sustainability, in particular by implementing appropriate social and economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reducing their activities connected with plans to rebuild depleted stocks, especially those working in less well-developed areas.
Given that the common fisheries policy is a common policy, we believe that those taking decisions in this field need to take responsibility for those decisions.
Consequently, we have retabled an amendment calling on the Commission to propose social and economic compensation measures aimed at providing Community funding for plans to rebuild depleted fish stocks.
Similarly, as we believe that fishermen and their representative associations should be involved in determining measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, we have retabled an amendment stating that decentralisation and co-management are two principles that are fundamental both in guaranteeing the involvement of fishermen and their representative associations in measures to protect the marine environment and rebuild fish stocks, but also in guaranteeing the effectiveness of such measures, bearing in mind that it is the fishermen and their associations, who have first-hand knowledge of the state of resources and who are most concerned to ensure their preservation, who will be applying such measures.
Â Â  . â Mr President, there is no doubt that the common fisheries policy and the traditional quota system have resulted in depleted fish stocks.
The more recent day-at-sea approach does not guarantee environmentally friendly fishing and bizarrely rewards the use of smaller mesh.
I am hopeful that policies developed under the newer system, where you have all-stakeholder consultation, will be better than the top-down policies.
I support closed boxes such as the recent Celtic Sea cod box, which, though difficult, has been supported by fishermen.
I believe that we must increase mesh size to prevent unnecessary discarding of juvenile fish.
Ninety millimetres should be the minimum mesh size in order to protect nursery areas and reduce discards.
More R[amp]D is needed to tailor selectivity devices such as square mesh panels and sorting grids to make them even more effective in protecting young fish.
This year gill netting has been banned in waters deeper than 200Â metres.
However, further measures are required, including restrictions on the length of gear and measures to prevent the stripping and dumping of nets at sea.
Mesh sizes for fixed gears must be harmonised.
I am confident that the measures outlined above, and others, can contribute significantly to sustainable fishing and ultimately lead to sustainable fisheries.
Â Â  â I should first like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work.
I also wish to say that I wholeheartedly welcome the Commission's initiative in issuing a communication on promoting more environmentally-friendly fishing methods.
The technical conservation measures have a more important role than ever in the future of the sector.
It is crucial that we adopt methods to improve selectivity and, therefore, the possibility of catching fish at the right size, taking account of biology and the life cycle of each individual species.
The satisfactory reproduction of fish, and in turn increased stocks, will only be possible if there are appropriate management measures, such as the temporary closure of certain fishing areas, to reduce bycatch to sustainable levels, and the effective practice of monitoring of vessels and fishing areas by means of satellite technology.
It is also necessary to become aware of the specific characteristics of fishing practices in the various Member States.
This knowledge will help to implement appropriate, well-balanced measures that will ensure the recovery and management of fish sources and safeguard the overriding interests of fishermen and vessel owners.
It is accordingly necessary to adopt a decentralised approach taking account of the specific characteristics of fishing areas and different species.
In spite of the Commissionâs good intentions, a more decentralised approach is sometimes needed on important and sensitive questions regarding the economic and environmental sustainability of fisheries.
Examples of this include the proposal initially put forward by the Commission for rebuilding fish stocks of southern hake and lobster and the most recent proposal on recovery of European eel.
I should like to finish by saying that the development of scientific research and technology sharing at Community level are key factors if we are to adopt more environmentally-friendly fishing rules.
In this context, I feel that we need to pay close attention to the channelling of funds that will be available as part of the new Community framework for supporting research.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to add my warm congratulations to Mr Ã Neachtain.
This report concerns a Commission communication which lies at the heart of the common fisheries policy.
I feel that in this and other areas, and using other instruments, we need to find solutions to the problems that we are facing, and that, accordingly, this debate today is of vital importance.
In the autonomous region of the Azores, considerable progress has been made in recent years, not least the prohibition of bottom gillnets and bottom trawls.
I do feel, however, that much remains to be done, in the autonomous region of the Azores and in all Community waters, as regards these more environmentally-friendly methods.
What is needed is, firstly, more first-hand fisheries management, with the fundamental concept of the marine habitat placed at the heart of fisheries policy implementation.
Secondly, we must prioritise the problem of discards, as the rapporteur has done.
We know that there are other countries within and outside Europe that operate a ban on any discard and I see no reason why we should not act more quickly and follow suit in the EU.
There is also the crucial problem of satellite systems for monitoring and detecting vessels, on which there is much to do if they are to comply fully.
Lastly, I should therefore like to ask the Commission to take on board the need to implement these systems at the earliest opportunity and to ensure their effective use.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Borg, ladies and gentlemen, promoting environmentally friendly fishing methods demonstrates that the European Union has become fully aware of the difficulties being experienced by this sector and the need for structural action for responsible exploitation of aquatic resources.
Reducing fishing pressure, because fish stocks are in a bad condition, optimising catches by avoiding huge quantities of fish being thrown into the sea because they are immature and reducing the impact on particularly sensitive habitats: these are the main objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, which we can endorse.
Adopting measures designed to protect and conserve living aquatic resources, to ensure that they are used in a sustainable way, to identify compensation measures for lost income and to support the development of research and innovation are priority commitments set out in the report under consideration.
This report has our firm support; in fact, if fisheries activities are made more environmentally friendly this will also contribute to promoting positive socio-economic conditions.
I am convinced that it will only be possible to correctly apply the technical rules governing fishing if fishermen are willing to comply.
It is therefore necessary to reinforce cooperation, agreement and participation by all those involved in the assessment, implementation and drafting of all technical measures to be adopted, and to promote a decentralised approach; in this way, once again, the European Union will decide not for its citizens but together with them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for the thought that has gone into the report and for its presentation.
The search for environmentally friendly methods of fishing is as long as the history of fishing itself.
Even in ancient times legal and technical measures were put in place in order to limit catches and avoid depleting the stocks and damaging the biomass and consequently the environment.
Only in the particular circumstances of the early 19thÂ century were all restrictions on fishing lifted.
At the end of the century things returned to normal, in other words, protective restrictions were reintroduced.
It seems that more complex protective measures based on scientific research were developed mid-way through the 20thÂ century.
These favoured so-called optimal fishing that involved regulating the age of the first catch.
There followed provisions on the permitted size of fish caught and the principles of selective fishing gear.
On the other hand, they simply restricted the limits, fishing effort and fishing potential.
As to specific issues in the document before us, I believe it is worth mentioning the new approach to protective principles.
In contrast to the protective measures applied to date, which mainly related to selective fishing, it is now proposed to protect the hitherto unwanted elements of the catch.
I think this is eminently rational and indeed noble. It would seem to be a case of political correctness as applied to fish.
Will this really be beneficial to the environment, though?
Experience has shown that selective fishing always weakens the biological strength of desirable species in the ecosystem.
The less useful species can take over the niche vacated by the more desirable ones.
It is therefore vital to recommend ongoing monitoring of the population of both groups and the relationship between them.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and to add that, despite the actions taken by the European Union, fish stocks are under constant threat and that this is due to three very important factors: firstly intensive rates of fishing, secondly fishing methods and thirdly maritime pollution.
The Committee on Fisheries adopted a report in January, the purpose of which is to promote environmentally-friendly fishing methods by proposing various technical measures, such as the definition of fishing areas, fishing periods and fishing tools.
We all wish for and are seeking sustainable exploitation of the seas and that is why we all need to move in this direction.
As part of this effort, I too should like to emphasise certain things:
Firstly, the measures applied must be based on adequate, substantiated scientific studies, taking account of the peculiarities of each area.
Secondly, fishing organisations must have a right of participation, opinion and codecision in the overall procedure.
In this way fishermen, realising the importance of and the need for the measures, will contribute to their more effective application.
Thirdly, more environmentally-friendly fishing methods imply less and more selective fishing, new equipment and loss of income.
It is therefore important to make provision for adequate resources to support efforts.
Fourthly, it is very important that stricter measures be taken to protect seas from contamination either from land or sea and
Fifthly, seas know no borders.
The European Union must find ways of ensuring that measures to protect the seas are applied not only by the Member States, but also by third countries.
To close, I wish to emphasise that it is the sacred duty of the entire world to leave clean seas with fish in them to future generations.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be the last tonight to add my congratulations to the rapporteur on his very good report.
However, one line jumped out at me, and that is that TACs cannot control fishing mortality because they control landings but not catches and discards.
This has been central to the problem of the common fisheries policy for decades and nothing that has been put in place by way of improvement has worked to date.
The cod recovery plan has not achieved the objective.
Fishermen in my region of Northern Ireland have faced closure in the Irish Sea for a long number of years and we have not seen any concrete evidence that this has been a success.
We need to look at where we are going.
Let us put the past behind us and start with a clean sheet of paper.
It is in every fishermanâs interest that future stocks are protected and, if we must have controls, then let the industry be part of the decision-making process.
You cannot continue to shut them out and blame them for non-cooperation.
We have that opportunity through the regional consultation process.
Let us bring everyone on board and let the industry be listened to and, above all, take on board some of its very good ideas.
It is a nonsense that if a fisherman says something, it must be wrong.
This cannot be the bottom line for us in the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I could not agree more that ultimately we need to take a broad view on the reasons for depleted stocks.
However, I will also stress that our communication deals with fisheries and how to come to grips with depleted stocks because, unless we reverse the trend as regards over-capacity and fishing effort, we will not deal with the problem effectively.
Regarding the point made concerning pilot projects on discards, there are indeed proposed projects in the North Sea aiming at increasing selectivity by new technical measures.
I need to underline however that calling for a complete ban on discards from Community waters is easier said than done.
This point was also raised by Mr Stevenson and by Mr Casaca.
Even with regard to Norway, where fisheries are much less mixed and less complex, it has not been without problems.
We are however looking at various ways of reducing discards, as I indicated in my initial presentation.
On another point made by Mr Stevenson concerning the studying of factors other than over-fishing, such as pollution and global warming â a point also raised by other honourable Members of Parliament â we are certainly willing to do this and we are doing so.
The problem exists independently of the problem of depleted stocks, and we need to address it if we want to regain sustainable fisheries in the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves.
In fact this is what we are trying to do by virtue of the proposed new technical measures and the communication we are preparing on maximum sustainable yields.
With regard to the point raised by Mrs Corbey, we are looking at the question of certification and labelling regarding sustainable fisheries by means of the eco-labelling proposal, which we hope to present during the course of this year.
I would also like to pick up the point that was made by Mr Hudghton, that environmentally friendly fishing methods are in the interests of the fishermen first and foremost.
However, I would not agree with his point regarding the abandonment of the common fisheries policy, which I consider to be a cornerstone and the very basis of sustainable fisheries in the European Union.
With regard to the point raised by Mr Guerreiro, let me reiterate that the issue of compensation for socio-economic measures is being dealt with in the context of discussions on the European Fisheries Fund, which I hope will be adopted at the April Council.
In response to Mr Freitasâs point regarding the Vessel Monitoring System, I would like to state that the Commission considers that satellite technologies offer a powerful means of detecting the presence of unauthorised fishing vessels in closed areas and many protected areas and strongly supports the use of remote control technologies for control of the major part of the European Union fleet.
The Commission supports VMS purchase and installation costs, and in fact the maximum amount paid during recent years has been in the region of EURÂ 2Â 250 for each blue box.
In parallel, the Commission encourages the use of vessel protection systems which allows identification of the presence of vessels with VMS systems through a satellite image.
I agree with the point made by Mr Braghetto, MrÂ Gklavakis and Mr Nicholson on involving the fisheries sector â the various stakeholders and the industry â in the management of fisheries and in the various measures needed to attain and maintain sustainable fisheries.
I also agree on the need to base our advice on scientific assessments.
I would also like to thank Mrs Attwooll, Mrs Sinnott, MrÂ Chmielewski and Mr Casaca for their views and for their very valid comments and remarks.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Before moving on to the items on the agenda, I must inform you of something you already know.
We will not have the opportunity to listen to President Mahmoud Abbas today.
A few hours after arriving in Strasbourg yesterday, our guest today, President Mahmoud Abbas, had to return to Ramallah. This was of course due to the dreadful and deplorable events that took place in Jericho and which have created a violent and dangerous situation.
Last night I informed him that Parliament understood perfectly well that the crisis created in Palestine obliged him to return to his country to take control of the situation.
Destiny and fate have led to a highly symbolic situation.
His having to leave Strasbourg having just arrived without being able to come to Parliament has something of the symbolism of Greek tragedy about it.
Mr Abbas represents the majority of Palestinians who still support a negotiated solution to the conflict with Israel despite all of the suffering and all of the disappointments they have been through.
He represents those people who, despite everything, still believe that it is possible to find a solution by peaceful means.
He is a man who has been trying to achieve peace through negotiations since the seventies and his presence here amongst us today would therefore have been a golden opportunity to support his approach; another opportunity missed as a result of an unnecessary and illegal military operation and the violence that it has caused.
The whole world is now wondering why and how such a military operation can help to strengthen Israel's security, why and how the humiliating pictures we have seen on the television or the destruction of that prison by bulldozers can contribute to Israel's security.
We Europeans will have to pay for a new prison, like so many other things destroyed during these tragic confrontations.
The violence that has followed this military action is extremely worrying.
As you know, the news this morning confirms that there are three western hostages, including two European citizens â two French citizens.
There have been rumours of more kidnappings, but they have not been confirmed.
Last night, before Mr Abbas left for the airport, I visited him in his hotel and he told me of the efforts he had been making during the day to stop this military operation and to prevent the spiral of violence before it became uncontrollable.
The President of the Palestinian National Authority asked me to explain to you his reasons for having to return to his country, in order to try to control the situation and to prevent any more kidnapping of Western citizens, which is currently causing huge concern.
The European Union staff who were controlling the border between Gaza and Egypt have also had security problems.
Furthermore, I must inform you that President Abbas has promised to return to Strasbourg and to speak to the European Parliament as soon as he can: probably during the next part-session in April.
If that happens, we will then have the opportunity to hear how he intends to tackle the serious crisis in his country.
I asked him whether he wanted the speech that he was going to make today to be distributed to the Members of Parliament in writing.
Mr Abbas felt that it had become out of date and that it was better to see how the current situation develops, and that he wanted to come to see us as soon as that situation allowed him.
I believe that this is a good time for the leaders of the political groups who wish to do so to speak.
Some of them have asked to do so.
Those who wish to speak may therefore do so for the relatively brief period of three minutes.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are all deeply concerned by the events that have occurred in the Middle East, and our group very much regrets that the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, is unable to speak to the European Parliament today.
At your proposal, MrÂ President, the chairmen of the groups decided to invite MrÂ Abbas here, because we see him as a man of self-control, conciliation and peace.
We therefore deeply regret that he cannot speak here today.
MrÂ President, you have explained the circumstances surrounding this.
In such situations, we are really pretty much helpless.
I would warn against jumping to hasty conclusions: we must be circumspect, and we must not exacerbate the spiral of violence.
However, we must demand an investigation into the storming of the prison in Jericho.
We must get an answer as to why this happened, and this answer must be convincing, if indeed there can be an answer at all.
As I am warning against hasty conclusions, at a time like this it is worth reminding ourselves of the principles.
We advocate an Israeli state within secure borders, but we also want a Palestinian state within secure borders.
The Israelis have the same status as the Palestinians, and the Palestinians have the same status as the Israelis.
I am convinced that, despite the pictures we have seen on television, the majority of people in both Israel and Palestine want to live peacefully.
We want to encourage everyone to follow this path to reach an understanding.
We call on all parties to put an end to the violence and to release the hostages â both European and non-European â because human dignity is a right for everybody.
I hope that the European Union will be able to make a contribution to peace in the region, in an objective, fair, non-partisan statement.
Our group supports anything that can help bring peace to the Middle East.
We very much hope â as you said, MrÂ President â that the time will soon come when the President of the Palestinian Authority, MrÂ Abbas, can make his speech to the European Parliament.
That is our heartfelt wish.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the comments made by MrÂ Poettering and, in particular, by you, MrÂ President.
We all deplore the events of the last few hours.
We particularly regret that Mahmoud Abbas is unable to speak to us.
We regret it not for our own sake but because he would have been able to come: the fact that he was already here, that he was able to come to this Parliament, that he could accept our invitation, was an encouraging sign, in particular that we are able to receive the elected Palestinian president here.
In so doing, we were providing a situation in which â as MrÂ Poettering just said â we are working together step by step towards a Palestinian state, by giving MrÂ Abbas his due, namely the future leadership of a state, representing his country in the region as an equal partner on the basis of full sovereignty.
That must be our aim.
And every little contribution that we can peacefully make to that is a job well done.
It would have been good if MrÂ Abbas had been able to take advantage of this situation, but that has now been postponed.
We quite deliberately say postponed, because we hope that we will be able to welcome MrÂ Abbas here as soon as possible.
With regard to the recent events in Jericho, however, which I discussed, last night and this morning with those Members who have been in the area as election observers for the past few weeks, my group is asking the question that always arises in international politics in such circumstances: ?
Who benefits from what happened?
Of course, we can only speculate about that, and speculation is not an answer.
However, I do have three questions.
The first question is: does it actually benefit anybody to storm this prison?
The answers we are currently getting from the Israeli media are not adequate.
I do not think it makes sense that a state whose services are able to carry out targeted assassinations needs to storm a prison when it comes to the potential release of detainees held there.
Surely there are ways to prevent that without needing to storm the jail.
My second question is this: Why was this action carried out at all, when international observers were monitoring this prison as part of an international agreement?
Why was this international commitment not honoured?
Why was it not used?
Thirdly, I hope that this action was not motivated by any internal political reasons in Israel.
It would be fatal if the internal political events that are due to take place in March were the real reason.
We would find that very regrettable, because it benefits nobody.
It might bring short-term domestic success, but it would harm the entire region in the long term.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal and Democratic Group, I too regret the fact that Mr Abbas has had to return home in such circumstances and I express my groupâs thanks to you for the statement that you made last night on this matter.
It certainly seems to us that where the tectonic plates of the worldâs three great monotheistic religions â Christianity, Judaism and Islam â are rubbing up against each other and causing sparks to fly, we need to proceed with extreme caution.
This House should not underestimate the risk of a wider conflagration in the Middle East.
The tragic events of 9/11 and the equally tragic response have seriously threatened the chances for continued peace in our world.
Just as European Union diplomacy with Iran is being undermined by George Bush riding roughshod over the Non-Proliferation Treaty in his dealings with India, so our diplomacy on the Middle East is being jeopardised by the actions of Israel yesterday.
I hope that the European Union, through the Council and Commission, will protest in the strongest terms to the Israeli Government about these actions.
There are questions to be asked about whether there was a conspiracy between the British and American monitors guarding the prison who left shortly before the Israelis moved in, and I hope the Council will come back to this House with a report once we know the full facts of the situation.
Nothing can justify the attack on the prison.
Nor can anything justify the hostage-taking that followed. I hope we will be able to move quickly to restore calm and confidence and I hope that we will be able to see Mr Abbas back in this Chamber in a much more serene set of circumstances, so that we can discuss seriously with all sides how we can create a secure and lasting peace in that troubled region.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Mahmoud Abbas was unable to speak here is not tragic, but hard to tolerate politically, because this would have been a forum for presenting a perspective of the current situation in the Middle East.
Unilateral policies like the ones currently being pursued in that region lead to catastrophe, and by that I mean the unilateral policies of both sides.
Unilateral mutual contempt leads to a dehumanisation of action.
We can see this in practice in that region.
In principle, we in the European Union, the Council, the Commission and MrÂ Solana must insist on one thing: there must be no more unilateral politics.
Israel cannot decide on its own what the Palestinian state should look like.
That is not on, and the international community cannot tolerate it.
The Palestinians and their Hamas-led government cannot decide on their own how and when force may or may not be used against Israel.
Europe and the world cannot simply close their eyes to this.
If both sides believe that their legitimate position can give them a universally valid right to action, allowing them not to talk to each other and to hold each other in contempt, then the international community must put an end to it.
That also means that the decision of when and how Israel takes action in the Palestinian areas cannot lie purely in Israeli hands, even in the event of security problems.
MrÂ Schulz, it is perfectly clear: there are domestic elections.
MrÂ Olmert and the Kadima party said they would return settlements.
By so doing, they scored points with the left wing.
Now they want to score points with the right wing, and so they took this action.
Let us have no illusions: it was pure electioneering.
The worst aspect of this affair is that the future of this region is being sacrificed for an election.
I would therefore say to everyone here: we must not deceive ourselves.
The Israeli action was outrageous.
The prison in Jericho was no longer a prison.
That is also the truth.
They could hold a press conference with 500 journalists in there.
I would like to see a prison anywhere in the world â and I have been jailed a few times â where you could hold a press conference with 500 journalists.
Both were unilateral, unacceptable actions, and we must simply recognise that.
If you want to release someone from prison â which is quite possible â there are ways of doing so under the rule of law.
That is what the Palestinians, and Hamas, should have done.
However, Israel does not have the right to storm an institution just because something is not right.
Therefore, let us be honest: what we have to fight against is unilateral, arbitrary actions by both sides.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the speed with which President Mahmoud Abbas accepted your invitation showed the importance he attached to visiting the European Parliament, a fact that highlights the seriousness of the decision he had to take to return home suddenly.
Indeed, he considered that his country could be placed in an extremely serious situation by this new and, as you rightly pointed out, deliberately humiliating escalation in Israeli violence and its inevitable consequences, all of which, like the kidnappings, were totally unacceptable, as well as being, however, unavoidable and foreseeable.
I think that this matter is of concern to the European Union on several counts, firstly because a Member State, namely the United Kingdom, had concluded an agreement with the United States and the Palestinian Authority under which it would be these two Western countries that oversaw the prison concerned.
It is that agreement that Israel has flagrantly violated, despite there not having been any problems at all in the prison for four years.
No prisoner has escaped or tried to do so.
If, moreover â and I would address MrÂ Cohn-Bendit now - Israel had thought that there was a problem, President Abbas had proposed to the Israeli Government that the prisoners be transferred to Moukata under proper, indeed international, surveillance.
There was therefore no excuse or basis at all for Israelâs decision.
Can we accept that?
The second reason why I think this matter is of concern to the European Union is â if I may speak frankly â the EUâs systematically indulgent attitude towards, formerly, Ariel Sharonâs government and, now, that of his successor.
How otherwise is it to be understood why an aspiring prime minister should dare be so reckless as to risk inflaming the already explosive situation in Palestine and in the region solely in order â and here I agree with my fellow MEPs â to appease the most extreme fringe of his electorate.
It really is hard to credit.
If he can allow himself to do this, it is because he knows that, on the one hand, American leaders give Israel carte blanche to do whatever it likes and that, on the other hand, Israel has got used to enjoying de facto impunity, courtesy of European leaders.
We now have to ask ourselves the following question: given the results of this policy, are we going to continue blithely to look on while this new blow to peace progressively weakens the position of those Palestinians most committed to peaceful solutions including, in the first place, President Mahmoud Abbas?
These are the questions that, I believe, we have to ask ourselves.
For my part, I shall submit three precise proposals tomorrow morning to the Conference of Presidents, all calling for an immediate reaction by our Parliament, the idea being formally to demonstrate our commitment to the rule of law and to a just peace in the Middle East.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, this is yet another display of intolerance between two states that we respect but that fail to respect each other.
An attack on a prison and on political prisoners is never regarded as acceptable anywhere, nor has it ever been in history.
Even political prisoners have the right to be in prison without being exposed to the threat of extra-judicial judgments.
Todayâs assault on the prison reminds me in a way of the enforcement of just such a judgment.
Naturally, this event will provoke further reactions and tensions on both sides, leading to what might be described as a ânever-ending storyâ.
I was truly looking forward to todayâs speech of the Palestinian President in this House, at the press conference and during our joint lunch, and IÂ expected to learn about the vision that Palestine intends to bring to the negotiating table in the hope of securing peace for the citizens of that part of the world.
I was hoping, and perhaps expecting, the European Parliament to assume the role of mediator.
It is my devout wish that we might offer assistance in this way, since both sides now need peace at last.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those moments when one is very uncertain, not knowing what might happen next, and when one is therefore concerned that it might be the start of some negative developments, after we had hoped for many years following the start of the Oslo process that agreement could be reached in this key area of world politics.
PresidentÂ Abbas, who was elected directly by his fellow Palestinians and therefore has legitimacy, seemed to be taking on a mediation role, in order to negotiate between those who advocate the renunciation of violence and recognition of Israel's right to exist and Hamas, which has not so far recognised this but has won an election, so that Hamas can be brought into the fold.
I am afraid that it is now obvious that this role is being abandoned and we do not know who else can fill it.
The action in Jericho was a significant, emotive event, which leads to problems on the Palestinian side.
However, I am much more worried that the withdrawal of the international observers from the United States and the United Kingdom will lead to the Quartet losing its credibility as a stabilising influence and a guarantor of stability.
I am afraid that it all goes much deeper.
On the other hand, Fatah's actions in Gaza showed that those who were previously in favour of the renunciation of violence under MrÂ Abbas are taking on a new role now that they have lost the elections and have lost their sources of profit.
And on the other side Hamas is not yet there.
Those who used to advocate the renunciation of violence are moving away from that position, and the others have not yet reached it.
That seems to me to be the current situation.
Both PresidentÂ Abbas and the Quartet have lost credibility in putting things right.
That is how it looks to me at the moment.
In our own interests, I hope that this depiction of the situation will prove to be false.
Â Â  MrÂ President, together with my fellow Member, MrÂ McMillan-Scott, I had the opportunity yesterday evening to spend three quarters of an hour with President Abbas, and I should like sincerely to convey to you how shocked we felt at the latest events and how angry they made us feel.
You said, MrÂ President, that these were fateful or chance events. In fact, they had nothing to do with either fate or chance.
The fact that the prison in Jericho was attacked at a period when the Palestinian President was in Europe to plead his cause, taking Saeb Erakat, the strong man of Jericho, with him, owes nothing to chance.
The current pantomime of half-naked, blindfolded prisoners with their hands tied together owes nothing to chance in a country that, as we know, is in torment.
The least thing can spark off violence, and caricature is never far away.
We are therefore faced now with an extremely serious event which, as MrÂ Brok has just said, is aimed at undermining the man who is the guarantor of stability between Palestine and Israel but who is also the guarantor of resistance to Hamas, which he would see become a force for peace.
It is these objectives that an attempt has today been made to undermine.
I do not know who will benefit from this crime, but what I do know is that we in the European Parliament must neither be fooled nor share responsibility for this crime, which we must condemn.
It is true that the situation is difficult and that negotiations were under way concerning the prisoner, MrÂ Saadate. It is true that the latter had been implicated in the murder of an Israeli minister, a murder that itself followed on from the killing of a PFLP leader.
Are we to continue this cycle of violence?
No, we must not. We need to keep a cool head, but we also need firmly to condemn what happened yesterday.
The situation is really extremely serious.
Â Â  . â Mr President, as you say, I chaired the delegation from this Parliament to the presidential elections in January 2005, when President Mahmoud Abbas was elected freely and fairly by the people of Palestine, and again in January 2006 when the parliamentary elections took place in such controversial circumstances. Nevertheless, they were free and fair.
We find ourselves with a man â Mahmoud Abbas â whose history you have described back to the 1970s, his commitment to peace, and his presence here today in an Assembly of 25 nations, directly elected, representing the very values that we are seeking to encourage in other parts of the world and especially in the Middle East: human rights, democracy, the rule of law, the free media, and so on. These are the values which I believe President Mahmoud Abbas was prepared to accept and of which he spoke in his inauguration speech in January 2005.
Speaking as a Briton, and with a deep commitment to the process of peace and democracy in the Arab world, I find it paradoxical, ironic and tragic that the two countries which speak so much about democracy in the Arab world are the very countries â the United States and the United Kingdom â which walked away from that prison, which abandoned their international responsibilities instead of reinforcing the prisonâs security.
We knew there was a problem; they knew there was a problem.
It was their duty to deal with it.
They did not: they walked away.
I hope, Mr President, that, when the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly, over which you preside, meets in Brussels in a few days time, we will hear a statement from the Commission and the Council on precisely what happened, why it happened, when it happened and who took the orders.
There is a case to answer here and a case that may need to be answered to the international community, but starting in this Parliament.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MahmoudÂ Abbas was supposed to appear before your House today to give a speech, but, for reasons of which you are aware, this speech had to be cancelled.
It is therefore natural that the leaders of the groups and other important Members wished to speak.
However, I would like to take the opportunity to express briefly, on behalf of the Council, our deep concern regarding the continuing and escalating violence in the Middle East.
The Austrian Foreign Minister and President of the Council, MrsÂ Plassnik, has condemned the violent attacks by radical Palestinians on EU institutions and has also given her support to the appeals by the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations in this connection.
The top priority is to restore peace and order and to protect human lives.
We must remind all those responsible that they have a duty to protect human lives and to free the hostages still detained.
As MrÂ Poettering quite rightly said, this is not the time for hasty conclusions.
The Council, too, will now discuss what specific steps need to be taken.
I also agree with MrÂ Schulz, who said that all the institutions â Parliament, the Council and the Commission â are duty-bound to act responsibly to ensure that the Middle East peace process does not break down irrevocably, but can continue.
We call on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to exercise restraint, in order to avoid further escalation.
In this context, I would also agree with MrÂ Cohn-Bendit that we need to prevent and avoid unilateral action.
That is not the way to resolve the problems in the Middle East.
Over the last few weeks and months, the foreign ministers have repeatedly grappled with the problem of the Middle East, most recently in Salzburg last weekend at the informal meeting of foreign ministers, on which MrsÂ Plassnik will report today.
Attacks on institutions, hostage-taking and all other kinds of violence do not just contradict our own values. They also disrupt and run counter to the peace efforts.
We hope that, together, we will be able to get the peace process back on track.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I share the widespread disappointment in the House that President Mahmoud Abbas has not been able to deliver his address here.
I personally had a meeting scheduled with him and am saddened that this has not taken place.
In any event, Commissioner Ferrero Waldner had a meeting with President Abbas yesterday, and, on the Commissionâs behalf, expressed our support for the quest for a peaceful solution to the Middle East conflict.
Let me state very clearly that we unequivocally condemn all forms of violence, regardless of which side perpetrated it, and we call on all parties to act responsibly and to exercise the maximum restraint.
We share the concern expressed by some speakers at the extremely dangerous situation in the region.
We must of course highlight the fact that some Europeans have been taken hostage and that the interests of the EU and of some Member States in the territories have been attacked.
I wish to point out that nobody has helped the Palestinian people more than the European Union.
The EU has been and continues to be a donor to the Palestinians, and so we appeal loudly and clearly for violence against EU interests or against our nationals to be avoided at all costs and call on all sides to exercise restraint, in order to prevent the situation from worsening.
We shall work together to ensure that the people of Israel and the Palestinian people can live in peace.
Â Â  At the end of the speeches, I would like to point out that the Conference of Presidents will examine the proposals that the chairmen of the political groups make and that in ten days time the plenary sitting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will take place in Brussels, marking the end of the European Unionâs Presidency of that institution.
I would like to call upon everybody to ensure that this meeting is used to ensure that the dialogue that everybody has mentioned this morning takes place properly.
In particular, I would call upon the Commission and the Council to ensure that their presence in that Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is a match for the circumstances, because at previous meetings they have perhaps not been as present as we would have liked or as we requested.
I hope that at that Euro-Mediterranean Assembly the Commission and the Council can present reports, measures and proposals that contribute to the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue and the contribution that Europe can make towards resolving the problems in the Middle East, which have certainly not been improved following yesterdayâs events.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I refer to RuleÂ 142 in conjunction with RulesÂ 132 and 137 of the Rules of Procedure.
Democracy can only work if the representatives of the people do not personally act in complete disregard of the wishes of the electorate and of the promises they made.
When we call â as we sometimes need to â for sacrifices to be made, when public budgets get tight, I would like to call on you once again to start your sittings on time; today we once again started five minutes late.
Your personal behaviour regarding the cumulative delays has already cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of Euro.
I call on the Members whose central election pledge was that they would use funds honestly â based on the world's leading daily newspapers today, the and the â finally to keep that promise.
It is pretty hard to take that you are now trying to prevent me from speaking.
Â Â  Mr Martin, of what does your point of order consist?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I made the observation and expressed the wish that you should please try to get here on time.
Your predecessor MrÂ Cox saved the taxpayers hundreds of thousands of Euro by doing so.
The same applies to the committees.
This wastes EURÂ 12Â million a year.
We cannot then say that we have no money for important social projects.
Â Â  Mr Martin, that is not a point of order.
I would like to remind you that the time you are wasting also costs the tax-payer money.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on a point of order.
I do not wish to delay the House long, but I have to raise this point because it is a serious matter.
Under Rule 191(8), relating to the Committee on Petitions, of which I am a member, a petitioner to the Parliament can insist on anonymity.
However, in a recent case being considered by the Committee on Petitions, the anonymity of MrsÂ X, a former member of Lloydâs, was breached, and as a direct result of that, MrsÂ X is being pursued by the British Government to the full extent of the law.
This could not have happened if her anonymity had been preserved.
It is essential, therefore, that this Parliament protect her position, maintain the rights of petitioners and stand up to the British Government.
The chairman of the committee has written to you as a matter of urgency, but has not yet even had the courtesy of a reply.
When will you respond, Mr President, and will you protect the rights and privileges of this Parliament and its petitioners?
Â Â  Mr Atkins, you have the right to ask what you like, but not in the form of a point of order.
The procedure you followed is not the appropriate one either.
I would ask all of you to use the appropriate procedures laid down in the Rules of Procedure in order to make your points.
This is not a point of order relating to today's sitting.
Nevertheless, I shall look into the situation of the letter that you say you have addressed to me and the reply which I imagine must be being dealt with.
Please do not make use of points of order procedures which relate exclusively to the work of the sitting under way to raise other issues which, however important they may be, cannot be used for the purpose of the kind of requests you are making.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparations for the European Council and the Lisbon Strategy.
Since we have altered our order of business as a result of the cancellation of the formal sitting, this debate will be extended until approximately twelve oâclock.
The vote will take place following the debate.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, one week before the Spring European Council, today's debate represents an excellent opportunity for us to get together to discuss the key priorities on which this summit will focus.
As you know, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy will be central to the summit.
It goes without saying that the best way of ensuring the success of such a venture is to prepare thoroughly, and the Council formations responsible for the various topics have therefore examined the priorities of the European Council from their perspective and submitted their contributions.
The draft conclusions will then be examined in the course of the stipulated procedure.
On the opening day of the European Council, on 23Â March, there will, as usual, also be the Tripartite Social Summit. This is intended to ensure cooperation between the Council, the Commission and the social partners, particularly with regard to employment, economic policy and social protection.
In this connection, we particularly welcome the initiatives of the European institutions for greater responsibility and greater ownership at Community level, as well as the valuable contributions made, for example, by the second interparliamentary meeting between the European Parliament and the national parliaments.
A great deal is also asked of the public in this connection.
The governments of the Member States have the task of better explaining the urgency of implementing this partnership for growth and jobs to their citizens.
In this respect, it is important for regional and local authorities â within the framework of their country's constitution â and civil society also to be involved in designing and implementing the national reform programmes.
In this constructive spirit, we also want today's debate to include an open discussion on options for solving the economic and social problems common to the whole European Union and on the important role that you have as the representatives of the people.
As you will be aware, in March 2005 the European Council agreed on an in-depth renewal of the Lisbon Strategy and also tightened up the procedure.
The new governance cycle is based on partnership and responsibility.
As part of their summit at Hampton Court, the Heads of State or Government gave greater political impetus to the newly revived Lisbon Strategy, focussing on the issue of how European values can reinforce the modernisation of the economy and society in a globalised world.
It is also important that the European Council, at its meeting last December, reached a political agreement on the financial perspective 2007-2013.
That in itself is an important sign that the European Union is capable of finding solutions, although we are of course aware that we are in the process of intensive and difficult dialogue with you, which we want to pursue constructively in order to implement this agreement between the governments in cooperation with you.
Europe is facing new challenges, including the increasing competitive pressure from outside, both economic and technological, the ageing population, rising energy prices and the need to guarantee energy security.
Since the end of 2005 there have been signs of slow but sure economic recovery.
It is projected that, in the three years from 2005 to 2007, six million new jobs will be created in the European Union. This would then reduce unemployment by almost one percentage point in 2007.
However, continuing to reduce unemployment, which currently affects almost 19.5Â million people, and increasing productivity and growth potential are still the greatest challenges for the European Union.
This economic recovery, albeit slight, forms an excellent opportunity to press on decisively with structural reforms in line with the national reform programmes and to pursue greater fiscal consolidation in line with the new Stability and Growth Pact.
Concrete objectives and timetables are a useful tool for accelerating the implementation of the planned reforms and achieving better results in terms of growth and jobs.
On the basis of its decisions from Spring 2005, the European Council has adopted integrated strategic guidelines. The Member States have then used those guidelines as a basis to draw up national reform programmes corresponding to specific national needs.
The Commission has presented a 'Community Lisbon Programme', proposing measures that should be taken at Community level.
The Commission's annual progress report also makes an important contribution to the process of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs.
All the Member States have drawn up their national reform programmes quickly and thoroughly.
These programmes are tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of each Member State, and serve to implement the reforms.
The national reform programmes are a decisive first step in progressing with greater individual responsibility and greater consciousness of the reform priorities.
All in all, these national reform programmes are a good basis for future work on the reform agenda.
In the opinion of the Commission, however â and at this point I would quite particularly like to thank the President of the Commission, MrÂ Barroso, for his institution's work, which is of great significance in the preparations for the summit, and especially for the speed and thoroughness with which they have worked â some of the programmes should include more specific objectives and timetables and additional details regarding the budgetary aspects of the proposed reforms, and go into the issues of competition and the removal of barriers to market access in greater detail.
The necessary instruments are in place.
The Member States' top priority for 2006 will therefore be the timely and comprehensive implementation of our objectives.
For this to be possible, it is vital for the Member States to intensify the measures they have already proposed.
The Commission has not proposed updating the guidelines for growth and jobs, which means that these guidelines will continue to be fully applicable.
The focus following the major changes last year should now be on more action and more continuity.
In line with the new governance of the strategy, the Member States have made real efforts to get the national parliaments, representatives of local and regional authorities, the social partners and other representatives of civil society involved in designing their national programmes.
We now need to get the citizens of Europe more actively involved in the process, in order to convince them that timely and properly implemented reforms will contribute to greater and better distributed prosperity.
To do this, we really do need your Houseâs assistance.
The European Parliament can help us to give all those involved greater responsibility for, greater ownership of, the Lisbon Strategy and to secure their future participation.
Debates like this one today are a particularly welcome opportunity to do so.
In this connection, I would also like to point out that the Austrian Presidency attaches very great importance to the compromise on the Services Directive reached at first reading here in Parliament.
It is a very well-balanced outcome, and it forms a sound basis for future efforts.
The sheer number of amendments proposed shows that this issue remains highly controversial.
In the light of this result and of the discussions to date in the Council, the Presidency is keen that the European Council should now call on the Commission to present its amended proposal as soon as possible and express the hope that the institutions will be in a position to bring the legislative process to a swift conclusion.
It is the Presidency's intention that, within the framework of the integrated guidelines adopted last year, the European Council should lay down specific priority measures to be implemented by the end of 2007.
As part of the renewed Lisbon Strategy, the spring summit will therefore be devoted to those issues given priority in the national reform programmes and the European Commission's report, namely research, development and innovation, policy for small and medium-sized enterprises, employment and energy.
Of course, we also need to continue to take action in general in the context of all three strands of the Lisbon Strategy â economic, social and environmental.
For us to be able to embark on a phase of real delivery and visible results, we need to aim for a good mix of verifiable voluntary undertakings by the 25 Member States and recommendations from the Commission.
How high we should set our sights is currently still being discussed as part of the preparations for the Council.
One pillar of the Lisbon Strategy is research and innovation, as the driving force behind production and knowledge use.
It is now four years since we set ourselves the target of achieving research spending of 3% in Europe by 2010, with a significant proportion of this funding, two-thirds, to come from the private sector.
It would be a good idea for the resources available from the European Union to rise in step with our own national efforts.
To that end, we also need to increase cooperation between universities, research and business to help increase research funding.
As we are all aware, though, we have not really got very far in this area, which is so important for our future â research spending in the EU currently stands at only about 1.9%.
Our joint efforts with the European Commission have enabled us to develop some momentum and to raise awareness in the Member States that specific goals and voluntary commitments to increase research spending are important.
In this respect all the Member States have already raised their sights and set their national targets accordingly.
Moreover, in our fast-paced information society, modern communications strategies play a vital role in promoting innovation.
In terms of higher education, we would like to call on the Member States, by 2007, to make it easier for universities to access additional private sponsorship and to break down barriers to cooperation between academic institutions and business, in accordance with their national conventions.
Secondly, more needs to be done to open up the framework conditions for businesses, business potential and, in particular, the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises.
This also needs to be a focus within the European Council.
Small and medium-sized enterprises form a major part of the European economy and can justifiably be described as its driving force.
There are around 23Â million small and medium-sized enterprises in the European Union, providing almost 75Â million jobs.
Measures to strengthen and promote small and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the European economy can therefore make a significant contribution to growth and jobs.
We also want to cut red tape for SMEs and reduce the time and costs involved in setting up new businesses.
Â Â  Mr Winkler, forgive me, but there is usually no limit to the time that the Council and the Commission can speak, but this morning we have timetable problems due to the time we took up during the last debate.
I would ask you, if you can, to limit your speaking time as well so that the Members can speak.
I would be grateful.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I apologise if I have spoken for too long.
I will abbreviate my comments and conclude.
There is an urgent need for action on a variety of subjects.
My remarks would be incomplete if I did not mention the labour market, including in particular promoting the integration of young people into the labour market.
Within the European Council itself, we want to pay particular attention to combating youth unemployment.
One of our aims is to reduce the number of school drop-outs by 2010 and to ensure that more young people complete secondary education.
Combating long-term unemployment must also be at the heart of our efforts.
Finally, the subject of energy will also play a particularly important role, not only because of the importance of the sector in generating jobs and growth, but also, of course, in the light of recent events.
I hope that, in this respect just as on all the other subjects I have mentioned, the European Council will provide an important impetus that will decisively influence the future activities of all the institutions of the European Union.
Â Â  No, Mr President.
There is no restriction to the time that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission have to speak, but today we all have to share the time available, a scarce and non-renewable resource.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, next weekâs European Council took place at an important moment.
We are now seeing the first encouraging signs of greater consumer confidence in Europe: investment is taking off again and growth figures are progressively improving.
That is good news.
Let us take advantage of this favourable economic context to take a new leap forward towards our objectives of growth and employment.
Let us move up a gear.
Last year, we proposed an in-depth review of how to steer economic policy in Europe.
We agreed to work together within a partnership.
We shared the responsibilities among ourselves and refocused our strategy and concerns on the essentials.
Your Assembly accorded huge support to this new approach, and I should like to congratulate Parliament on the role it is playing in this connection.
In its report to the spring European Council, the Commission proposed several priority measures in favour of growth and employment.
I do not wish to go into detail concerning all of the specific measures we propose taking but shall single out a number of themes that I think are particularly important today.
I am now delighted that 25 national programmes of reform have been adopted, describing how, in terms of the actual circumstances peculiar to itself as a nation, each Member State intends implementing the jointly agreed guidelines for growth and employment.
Admittedly, not all of the national plans for reform are equally ambitious. Nor, it is true, are they all of the same quality.
Nonetheless, they do constitute a sound basis on which to work.
Let us be clear.
This is only a first stage, and everyone knows that reports do not create jobs.
We now need to see political will and determination in putting these intentions specifically into practice.
That is why, this year, it is time to translate words into deeds.
During the next few months, the Commission will work in close cooperation with the Member States with a view to helping implement their national programmes and to following these up.
I am very grateful to Parliament for the role it is adopting in this connection.
The joint parliamentary sittings held by the European Parliament and representatives of the national parliaments and devoted to the Lisbon Strategy have made a significant contribution to raising the national parliamentsâ awareness of what is at stake and have encouraged them to participate in the process.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fact is, however, that, in terms of the Member Statesâ taking this new strategy for growth and employment to heart, there is still work to be done.
Within the framework of the partnership, the Member States draw lessons from othersâ experience.
Everyone has something both to offer and to learn, but I can never emphasise enough that we not only need action at the level of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament but also need actively to involve the national parliaments, social partners, national parties â and not only the European parties â and European public opinion.
That is a condition for our renewed strategy for growth and employment succeeding.
Another important issue is that of the free movement of workers.
I noted that, in the resolution it proposed by way of concluding this debate, Parliament called on the Member States, and I quote, âto move as fast as possible towards total freedom of movement for workers and other citizens within the EU and to undertake determined action to promote the quality of work in all its aspectsâ.
I entirely concur with this proposal of the European Parliament.
What is more, the facts prove you right.
A recent study by the Commission clearly shows that the flow of workers from the Central and Eastern European Member States into the old Member States has, in the main, had beneficial effects.
That is only one of the reasons why the Commission welcomes the announcement made recently â and, more specifically, after the publication of our communication â by Finland, Portugal and Spain in the first instance and now by the Netherlands to the effect that they were joining Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden in lifting the restrictions on the free movement of workers in Europe.
I am impatient to see other countries join them.
In a globalised economy, no Member State can allow itself to go it alone.
This is not the moment for economic nationalism.
It is not by employing nationalist rhetoric that we shall be able to build the Europe of tomorrow.
Defending oneâs national champions in the short term generally leads, in the longer term, to relegating them to the second division.
More efficient companies, which have had to face all the rigours of competition, will overtake the national champions once they appear on the international markets.
Let us be clear. What we need is not national champions, but world champions that are based in Europe and benefit fully from our internal market.
Let there be no misunderstandings, however.
The Commission will exercise its prerogatives if companies abuse their dominant position in the market.
The Commission is required by law to protect the consumer and to ensure that the rules of competition are applied, and it will carry out those duties in full.
The challenge of globalisation calls for a strengthening of the internal market.
Freedom to provide services is an essential element of the internal market, and we have already said that the services sector, on the one hand, and small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other, are the most relevant drivers today for employment in Europe.
I want to thank you for the result of Parliamentâs first reading of the Services Directive.
You came forward with amendments generally based on a broad consensus which can now move us forward.
The Commission will respond positively to your consensus.
Early next month we will present an amended proposal, which will be largely based on this first reading and the discussions in the Council.
We know that the Austrian Presidency will work on the common position of the Council shortly thereafter.
I hope that this legislation can then be adopted swiftly, as we need to make progress in this area if we are serious about growth and jobs.
The energy challenges of the 21st century require a strong and effective response.
After a long period of relative stability, we can no longer take secure and affordable energy supplies for granted.
Increased import dependence, higher energy prices and climate change are challenges shared by all European Union Member States.
Only a European response, based on sustainability, competitiveness and security, can deal with the magnitude of these challenges.
In the Commissionâs Green Paper we have highlighted six key actions.
We must create a truly single European electricity and gas market.
We must achieve better integration. With better integration comes more solidarity between the Member States in times of crisis.
We must accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, using both new energies and existing ones to ensure sustainability.
We must change not just energy supply but energy demand.
There is considerable scope to use energy more efficiently to the benefit of the climate, consumers and our security.
Europe is at the leading edge of the development of low-carbon technologies. We must stay there.
We need more European innovation for renewables and everything that concerns environmentally friendly technologies.
Last but not least, we must foster a more coherent and integrated approach in our relations with third countries and in international fora.
I sometimes hear people say that a European energy policy is not feasible because it touches areas where Member States have national strategic interests.
I do not need to remind you that the very basis of the European Community was in fact a common European policy on coal and steel, the two areas which were considered the most sensitive in terms of the national strategic interest of the Member States at that time.
It is exactly because energy is strategic that we need a European strategy and not 25 national strategies.
That is precisely the reason why we need that strategy.
The Green Paper invites everybody to contribute to this important debate.
I am very encouraged by the good reaction that our Green Paper received and by the very committed support of the Austrian Presidency, and I look forward to strong support from the European Parliament for this new European Union strategy.
I also want to stress the need for social cohesion to be considered an integral part of the growth and jobs creation strategy.
The Commission is keenly aware of the need to ensure high-quality jobs and avoid precarious working conditions.
I believe that globalisation offers major opportunities, but we cannot and should not ignore the pressure on companies and workers resulting from fierce international competition.
That is why the Commission has proposed a European globalisation adjustment fund.
That fund will act as a shock absorber to the powerful engine of globalisation.
It will complement Member Statesâ efforts to help get the workers affected back on their feet again.
The important thing is to get people retrained and back on the job ladder in a sustainable way.
We need to involve social partners in our discussions on jobs and labour markets.
Europeâs economic future depends on having the best educated and trained people, with a full range of skills and the adaptability required for a knowledge economy.
That is why we must boost investment in higher education significantly.
The Commission suggests a target of 2% of GDP by 2010.
At the same time, we must boost Europeâs research and development spending to 3% of GDP by 2010.
That means more ambitious national targets and more ambitious measures to achieve them.
We have some excellent universities and research centres which will really benefit from more funding.
However, our systems are fragmented.
There is a gap between higher education and research, on the one hand, and companies and the economy on the other.
They do not appear to be connected.
Too many of our top brains are leaving Europe.
That is why the Commission, in search of excellence, has proposed a European institute of technology.
A European institute of technology would complement other measures; it would use the resources made available by its participating partners and do so more effectively for their benefit and for the benefit of the entire European Union economy.
It is an ambitious project.
I will be asking the Heads of State and Government to endorse this idea and I am asking Parliament for support.
Airbus and Galileo have shown us the importance of successful European flagships.
The EIT should be the next one; it is a symbol of a European purpose, but it is not just a symbol: it adds value to our collective efforts in terms of research, education and innovation.
I am also aware of the need to do more in this area and I believe that this can be a clear commitment now for this knowledge triangle.
In short, more commitment to Europe will bring more prosperity and freedom to our citizens.
I warmly thank you for your support so well expressed in your motion for a resolution.
Next week the European Council must show a similar commitment to growth and jobs.
The time has now come for delivery, not of more words but of action.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Lisbon stands for growth, employment and thus, at its heart, for the competitiveness of the economy of the European Union, and I am delighted at the President of the Commission's personal commitment and at the fact that he is focussing his Commission's efforts in this area.
I would like to thank him for saying that a return to economic nationalism or â some want to put a positive spin on it â economic patriotism would mean the downfall of the European economy and would result in us not being internationally competitive at all in the globalised world.
I am therefore grateful for the combative attitude, and I hope you will say the same thing in the Council at the meeting of the Heads of State or Government.
MrÂ Winkler, we think very highly of you as a person, and we appreciate the fact that you are here, but when the President of the Commission is here it would be appropriate for the Presidency of the Council to be represented at a similarly high level, by a minister.
We need to bear that in mind.
I would like to make it clear that I have the greatest respect for you personally, but the institutions must have equal representation in such debates.
I say that quite independent of any party-political affiliation.
This is about the institutions of the European Union.
The European Parliament gives a high priority to the Lisbon process, which is a continuous process and is not limited to 2010.
That is why we set up the steering group under the chairmanship of MrÂ Daul.
I am pleased that the three largest groups â yes, and maybe one day the others will join in too, MrÂ Wurtz â are putting this at the heart of their activities, as of course is the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, even though they are not here, and maybe some others too ...
.... it is true, the leaders are not here, and you should be pleased that I am paying so much attention to them.
The single market, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, is the precondition for the European Union to be competitive on the global markets.
I call on the Heads of State or Government and on the governments to take Parliament's efforts regarding the Services Directive as their example.
To the governments I say: anyone who now wants to achieve something different will destroy this compromise on the Services Directive.
I therefore call on the governments to take the European Parliament as their example.
I also welcome the fact â this is not my job, but I am pleased as the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â that one of the leaders of the Greens is now here.
Together we will forge Europe, MrÂ Cohn-Bendit.
We need the entrepreneurial spirit in the European Union.
Enterprises are not an abstract concept, and getting involved means making freedom a reality.
Entrepreneurial spirit means creating jobs.
We need a positive perspective in this connection.
MrÂ Barroso, we welcome the proposal you have put forward for a European Institute of Technology.
This must involve creating not a big new university authority, but a network between the various European technological institutes already in existence, so that we get added value and so that Europe can really be one of the global leaders in innovation and research.
You referred to GALILEO and Airbus.
We need new projects, and to that extent we support your considerations.
One final remark, as I do not have 15 minutes like the Council and the Commission: at some point, MrÂ President, we need to think about how we can achieve a better balance.
I would advocate that this House should work closely with the national parliaments on this issue, because it is our joint task, both nationally and in Europe, to make Europe competitive and to ensure that it develops well economically and in general.
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on a point of order under RulesÂ 166(1) and 121(2).
I apologise for interrupting the debate, but before it began Sir Robert Atkins rose on a point of order which you ruled to be out of order because it did not concern the business of the day.
He was actually referring to an extremely important issue which is covered by RuleÂ 166.
When the Parliamentâs Rules are being disregarded, it is quite in order for a Member to draw that to your attention.
Sir Robert was stating that the British Government may well be acting and in breach of Community law as regards a breach of confidence.
The Committee concerned has written to you.
I ask you whether it is possible for you to give your reply to Sir Robert Atkins before the vote.
I should like to remind you once again that I am referring to RuleÂ 166(1) and RuleÂ 121(2).
I apologise for this interruption.
Â Â  I regret this interruption as well.
Ladies and gentlemen, from now on, the Presidency will have to be stricter when considering requests for points of order, because, over and over again, you are making use of this procedure for purposes for which it was not designed.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Lisbon process was launched, it was the first real attempt, and in my opinion a very well thought-out one, at giving a European response to the challenges of globalisation.
The starting point used in Lisbon was that we would only be able to survive intercontinental competition and continue to compete with competitors on other continents over the long term if we become the strongest knowledge-based society and national economy in the world â but at European level.
It was the right step to take, but what has happened since then?
Those who decided to take this step cannot decide whether they want to take it at European or national level.
They are pulled back and forth between the message that 'we can only survive in this competition as a united Europe', which is right, and the message in their own country that 'actually, in principle we are strong enough as a government to do it ourselves', which of course is more popular with the voters.
The result is that there has not been enough investment in the Lisbon process at either European or national level.
That is the situation after six years!
MrÂ President of the Commission, I am grateful for what you said, but I also regret that you are keeping quiet on something else.
There is a gaping chasm between what you have once again described as being necessary as a commitment, including financially, and what happens in practice.
You and your Commission have described what is needed in terms of funding for the EU over the next seven years, and the Council has adopted a financial basis.
The problem is, there is a gap of 40.82% between what you asked for and what the Council decided!
The Council agreed to 40.82% less than you had requested for the financial perspective.
Those, MrÂ President, are the different messages, the different-shaped bricks.
You cannot build a beautiful house with different-shaped bricks.
You cannot even build a shack.
You cannot even build a ski hut in Arlberg am Lech â or rather Lech am Arlberg â to sing sea shanties in of an evening.
Welcome to the valley, MrÂ President!
The downhill race is now over.
The troika on the financial perspective, which we will experience in the next few days, and the subsequent summit once again draw attention to this discrepancy.
The troika is ruled by penny-pinchers, scraping together every last Euro so that the money cannot be given to Europe.
Three days later, the Heads of State or Government will meet, and once again proclaim how important the Lisbon summit and the Lisbon objectives are.
That is precisely what is holding Europe up: there is no coherent, consistent approach to the Lisbon process!
In the European Parliament, we have tried to combine the flexibility Europe needs with the social cohesion it cannot do without, because these two aspects belong together.
If we want to take the people with us â yes, MrÂ Winkler, you are quite right there â if we want the people to come with us, we must depict globalisation as an opportunity, but also reduce the risk that it could be used to break down social standards.
With the Services Directive, we tried to say yes to flexibility where necessary and possible, but only if we retain social cohesion.
I therefore assume that the European Parliament's decision will form the basis for the Commission and Council to continue consultations on the Services Directive.
I can only warn against deviating from it.
You made the promise, MrÂ Winkler, and you said today that you would keep that promise.
We will ensure that you do, you can be sure of that!
It is indeed the case that enough ink has been used up on the subject of the future of the Lisbon process.
What we need is investment in research and qualifications, so that our best people do not drift away to other continents.
What we need is investment in lifelong learning, because, if good qualifications are a prerequisite for access to the labour market, then lifelong learning is a basic right that guarantees that everybody has that access.
Yesterday, the President of the Federal Republic of Germany clarified the desires of young people in Europe using the example of the Erasmus scheme.
However, Erasmus is one of the points where the Council has reduced the financial perspective the most.
So, I will say it again: in the Lisbon process, nothing fits together.
Â Â  . Mr President, more than at any time in the Unionâs history there is a disjunction between those who seek to move forward and those who wish to turn back; between those who defend the single market and the Lisbon Agenda as the best means to guarantee long-term efficiency, competitiveness and growth, and those who reject free trade in favour of economic patriotism akin â as Giulio Tremonti said â to that immediately before the 1914-18 war.
The irony is that this so-called patriotism â thinly disguised economic nationalism â will bring as few benefits to the citizens of France, Spain or Poland as it does to the rest of Europe, for it is fair competition that drives the global market, raises quality and lowers prices, and it is fair competition that protectionism undermines.
If any company can see commercial logic in merging with another, what business is it of ours to put roadblocks in its path?
The great success of the euro, as the President of the Commission has pointed out, is that mergers and takeovers are proceeding apace.
European industry is gearing up for the challenges of competing in a global economy.
These are issues for the Spring Council.
They are issues for the Commission because the Commission is going to be tested in this climate as a defender and guarantor of the Treaties.
Faced with an unprecedented assault on the internal market, the Commission must hold firm to the Treaties, hold firm to the basic freedoms and speak out when necessary â as you have, President Barroso, and as Commissioners McCreevy and Kroes have too â and act to defend the Union.
But defence of the single market falls not only to the Commission; the Council has a role, as we stress in the motion we debate today.
That means the Spring Council expediting transposition and implementation of the Unionâs directives to deliver a single market with free movement of goods, services and capital.
We want to see the European Council deal seriously with free movement of services, free movement of workers and free movement of capital.
As they discuss the future financing of our Union, let the Heads of State and Government find the funds necessary for the training of our workforce, for the trans-European networks and for research and development through the European Institute for Technology, which will secure future economic dynamism.
It is time for our Heads of State and Government to formalise the Council meetings that take place in March and October.
These need not be billed purely as economic policy summits; the demands of energy security, of peace in the Middle-East and of fighting internationally organised crime are equally urgent and should be on next weekâs agenda.
There should be public discussion too of the Unionâs burgeoning defence policy, currently being planned behind closed doors.
The Austrian Presidency opened to public scrutiny a recent Environment Council meeting; why not make this openness universal practice in the Council?
My group welcomes the Commissionâs proposal to bring forward a concept paper so that we can discuss defence policy here in Parliament and involve our citizens in the discussion of what our continent can become.
President-in-Office, a century ago your country had a foreign minister who studied in Strasbourg, restored the old regime and dominated continental politics for 30Â years.
If Mrs Plassnik can emulate Metternichâs achievements, Europe will prosper. If she fails, she can always follow his example and flee to Britain.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, MrÂ Barroso, as time has gone on my group has realised that the Lisbon strategy is no longer the strategy that was set out at the start of this very interesting process.
This was very clear in MrÂ Winkler's speech.
It is now a very one-sided strategy for growth and jobs.
The idea that the aim of sustainability and social equity, as set out in Gothenburg, should also form part of this strategy has been completely disregarded.
Following the discussions I witnessed in the coordination structure for Lisbon and in the light of what we have drawn up as a motion for a resolution, on which we will vote today, I am afraid there is a risk that Parliament is no longer prepared to pursue this ambitious strategy to actually link sustainability and growth together.
Why do I say that? There is absolutely no willingness to discuss important instruments that would guarantee success.
In this coordination structure, we tried to discuss fiscal policy.
If we are not prepared to consider uniform company taxation within the EU, how are we going to solve negative location competition?
If we are not prepared to talk about ecological taxes, how will the state be able to promote sustainability in a controlled manner?
Some of the Members of this Parliament are unwilling to use the word 'tax' at all: they are afraid of frightening the citizens.
They make promises to the people, but do not ensure that instruments are set up to put us in a position to actually keep these ambitious promises.
Let us take an important topical example: energy policy.
To Commissioner Verheugen, to MrÂ Barroso, I say this: if you are not prepared to incorporate transport policy into your energy policy strategies, if you are not prepared to put the conservation of resources and efficiency right at the heart of your strategies, and if you continue to focus on prolonging the lifespan of nuclear power stations, then you are doomed to failure.
You will not reduce dependency on raw materials, and you will not be in a position to secure fair prices on the energy market.
Just look at the countries where a high proportion of energy comes from nuclear power.
Is electricity in France and Germany cheap?
No, it is expensive.
With regard to the market, MrÂ Barroso, I have one request: trust MrsÂ Kroes's proposals from last week.
The market cannot currently be applied to energy.
We need the production and distribution of energy, generation and the network, to be separated.
As MrsÂ Kroes quite rightly said, we will only have a chance against the energy giants politically if we actually push the market through against them.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Winkler, the Commission generally has the knack of finding evocative patronymics for its programmes: Erasmus, Socrates and so on.
Well, it could have called its Lisbon Strategy âJanusâ after the famous Roman deity, traditionally represented as having two faces: one looking to the future and the other to the past, exactly like the Lisbon agenda.
One of these faces of the Lisbon Strategy for the ten-year period 2000â2010 is pleasing and calls to mind the conclusions of the 2005 spring European Council with their talk of the need for, and I quote, âinvesting in human capital [which is] Europeâs most important assetâ. It heralds more jobs â even full employment â as well as better quality jobs.
It emphasises the importance of research, education and innovation, as well as of having a solid industrial fabric throughout the territory of the EU. It even puts forward the objective, and I quote, of âhalting the loss of biological diversity between now and 2010â.
That particular face of the European Janus looks towards the future.
It seems to herald such an era of social, economic and ecological progress that, at first sight, it is difficult to understand why the Commission considers, and I quote, that â[a] lot remains to be done to convince people that reforms will contribute to greater, shared prosperity and to involve them in the processâ.
Why, for heavenâs sake?
It is because there is the other face of the Lisbon Strategy, this one directed towards the EU leadersâ unrelenting liberal obsessions.
I would refer to the latest Commission communication with its references to, for example, the need to make Europe more attractive to business, to reforming pensions, the health sector and the labour market and to stabilising the budget, raising the retirement age, increasing productivity at work, ensuring genuine competition in the services sector and promoting increased competition in the electricity and gas markets.
The Commission even expects the unions to play a role in the proliferation of this liberal strategy and expects Parliament also to convey its virtues.
We are seeing German civil servants joining forces to protest against longer working hours and lower salaries and Italian employees demanding a thorough review of law 30 and the way in which it blithely generates job insecurity.
We are seeing young French people rebelling against plans for two-year contracts of employment enabling bosses to dismiss them at will, female salaried staff in Britain challenging plans to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years and employees in the new Member States of Central Europe opposed to their countries being considered part of a low cost zone and demanding their rights to social progress. Faced with these people and, indeed, all those opposed to the strategy of squeezing public and social expenditure that is being conducted under the aegis of the Stability Pact, do not, I beseech you, rely on us to explain to them that they are mistaken because, contrary to appearances, the Lisbon Strategy has their well-being at heart.
The truth of the matter is that the two aspects of the Lisbon Strategy are incompatible.
The second needs to be thwarted so that the first might thrive.
That is the choice facing us.
Â Â  MrÂ President, following the French and Dutch rejections of the Constitution, the EU summit decided to arrange a break in which to think about Europeâs future.
It now appears that this was not a pause for thought but, rather, entailed a change in the order of who is to ratify and when.
Since the two ânoâ votes, the Constitution has been approved in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Malta, Latvia and, most recently, Belgium.
The process is under way in Estonia, and Finland will approve the Constitution before it takes over the Presidency on 1Â July.
A delegation of us from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs visited Helsinki the other day.
Just one small party, representing true Finns, will respect the French and Dutch ânoâ votes.
The Constitution proposes that ratifications be allowed to continue until 80% of the countries have approved the Constitution, at which point a special summit would take place.
The provisions of the Constitution cannot, however, be the basis for changing the Treaty of Nice, where unanimity is the rule.
The Constitution is therefore formally dead following the French and Dutch ânoâ votes.
In the Netherlands the government has stated that it will not ratify the rejected document, and in France the leading politicians say the same thing.
It is therefore illegal to continue with the ratifications without a new decision, unless France and the Netherlands are engaging in double-dealing and saying one thing at home and something else in Brussels.
I should like to ask the Presidency whether France and the Netherlands have formally agreed that the ratifications can continue without changes to the rejected document.
Would it not be better to use the breathing space to think out new ideas and so prepare a document that people can approve in referenda in all the countries on the same day, a document in which the key headings could be transparency, democracy and proximity to the people?
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Winkler, and President Barroso for their presentations here today.
Having looked at and discussed this issue over a number of years, one of the things that strikes me is: what do we really want from the Lisbon Strategy?
The core elements and goals are still as valid today as they were when it was first agreed: to make Europe the most dynamic and innovative economy in the world by 2010.
Unfortunately what we hear today is everything but the kitchen sink being thrown into what the Lisbon Strategy should be doing.
Perhaps we are too ambitious or too wide-ranging with regard to the areas that we want to see included.
One of the most important issues â brought up by all speakers in this House today â has been the investment in human capital: the issue of training, education and the way in which that leads to further research, and future innovation and development.
Let us really look at what is happening in the European Union at the present time.
Look at the human demographic situation, where we have an ageing population, a dropping birthrate in most Member States, and where we do not have strategies to respond to that.
We need strategies that look to the positive facet of that ageing population, to the experience that they have; but also strategies that are realistic in seeing that people are being denied opportunities to access the new labour market.
We need to give them the skills and training that they require to work in the so-called digital economy.
Despite all the honeyed words we may spout here, the reality of who is best able to deliver on those strategies â who is best able to give those skills to young workers, students or older people who want to retrain or re-skill â is that it is not the European Union, but each Member State.
That is why we have asked for national plans with clear targets that will guarantee the return of the investment.
When we speak about the European employment strategy, social cohesion and social partnership, it is vital that people are carried along, but it is also vital that people wake up and see the reality of what is happening with relocation of industry â as was discussed yesterday â and the lack of investment in research and development.
Look at the 20 leading biotechnology firms in the world. Nineteen are American and one is Swiss â none is within the European Union.
If we want to be realistic about being the most dynamic then we must take tough decisions to reflect that position.
Â Â  Mr President, the report from the high level group chaired by Wim Kok provides a realistic description of the state of the EU economy, which faces the threat of marginalisation in relation to the Asian and American markets.
The global market is benevolent towards economic entities that are efficient, competitive and which offer cheap, good quality products and services.
The direct involvement of Member States and parliaments in implementation programmes can be counted as one of the successes of activities aimed at pursuing the Lisbon Strategy.
Action related to the energy security programme may also create better, stable conditions for economic development.
The fact that a large group of people is taking part in the implementation of the strategy may also give rise to optimism.
The problem lies in the effectiveness of the actions and the resistance shown towards them.
These actions include the creation of an internal market, a labour market, the right conditions for restructuring and the creation of businesses and the growth of innovation, while simultaneously doing away with unemployment and increasing wages.
We need a consensus between political groups, trade unions and employers.
There are particularly significant obstacles to the process of restructuring, organising of the agricultural market and limiting agricultural production costs.
The lack of viability in some production sectors means that large numbers of holdings are facing liquidation and that there is an increase in unemployment and unused land.
This is why it is vital to take rapid action to establish an agricultural production system with a guaranteed market, such as bio-fuels and biomass.
We need a multi-annual programme to adapt farming to new market conditions.
The process of scrapping protectionism, which does not create but only decreases added value and increases social costs, faces large obstacles.
Finally, I would like to mention an optimistic quote from the German President, âWe should make challenges into opportunities for successâ.
I think this is something we can achieve.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish all the institutions the very best for the actions they need to adopt over the next few weeks or at the summit, which must be starting points for the future of Europe.
The motto for all the sittings in the coming weeks must, as MrÂ Barroso said, be âdeeds not wordsâ.
We call for actions that leave no doubt that we reject particularism, protectionism and the 'charity begins at home' mentality.
We call for courageous, concrete, verifiable European actions from the Member States for growth and jobs and for energy policy.
We call on the Member States finally to come into line on the Services Directive and the financial perspective and not to stand still any longer.
What do we want?
First, we want decisive actions, so that the European Union can continue to develop towards a political union with greater courage, credibility and decision.
A political union is our primary goal.
Secondly, we need to create a functioning internal market and take action so that it ultimately develops into a domestic market.
When will we be able to talk in terms of a domestic market for all?
When we waste as little time as possible in implementing the four freedoms for all citizens of an EU without borders.
Freedom and responsibility instead of chains, protectionism, nationalism and partitioning transitional rules â these things are our goal, and they will provide common added value for the citizens of Europe.
Thirdly, anybody who nationalises rather than Europeanises is throwing sand in people's eyes.
Where are the initiatives and projects to implement Plan D and to get the people involved in the European project?
Fourthly, I also call for codecision with the European Parliament on all internal-market related issues, on issues of growth and employment and on the financial perspective.
It is evident that the unanimity rule in the Council blocks progress, prevents or impedes European solutions and strengthens particularism.
That is not what we want.
Fifthly, we need specific European projects, not just national action plans: the creation of a European research framework, the creation of a European infrastructure, the creation of a European energy market, the creation of a European airspace, the creation of a European establishment and innovation offensive, the expansion of the European education programme.
For all of that, we want to see projects and actions, not just declarations.
Sixthly, we do not have a common economic policy, which means that we need to coordinate economic policies much more closely.
The EU is an opportunity.
Particularism and protectionism are our own home-made risk.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, MrÂ Barroso, a strategy without resources is like Napoleon without an army: powerless and ultimately useless.
That is the threat hovering over the Lisbon Strategy.
With a meagre financial perspective, unbalanced national budgets and a Community budget representing less than a third of the American budgetâs mere deficit, is the EU reduced merely to making gestures?
The draft resolution I have prepared together with my excellent fellow Member, MrÂ Lehne, indicates a few worthwhile paths to go down, even if our Parliament sometimes refuses to look the truth in the face.
Thus, the majority of MEPs have ignored the fact that a substantial portion of the United Statesâs growth surplus in recent years was the result of integrating more than ten million legal immigrants.
We need a more generous European immigration policy.
Would such a policy be conducted at the expense of developing countries?
According to the United Nations, transfers of money from immigrants to their families represent more than double the amount spent on international development aid.
The spectacular economic development of India, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong owes a lot to companies set up by former emigrants who have returned home.
The Europe of research is still to be built.
It is mainly medium-sized companies that do not invest enough.
One of the causes of this phenomenon is the excessive bureaucracy hindering access to European funds.
Another is the lack of cooperation between businesses and universities.
The latter should be able to obtain more resources for themselves by investing in promising young talent and by increasing the prestige of their research activities through the conferring of associated diplomas and degrees.
Where energy is concerned, Europe must combine with the other big consumers â the United States, Japan, China and India â in order to counterbalance the cartels and oligopolies that dominate the oil and gas sectors.
Faced with a market dominated by a handful of producer companies, there is no point in seeking refuge in the mere liberalisation of the European market, especially when such liberalisation leads to the emergence of a small number of so-called European champions which will end up dividing the market between themselves.
In the case of the American energy market, liberalisation was far from being a success.
The demographic development faced by Europe constitutes more than just a challenge for the funding of social security.
The ten or twenty yearsâ increase in life expectancy for generally fit and healthy populations also presents a great opportunity.
Strategies need to be devised enabling people to remain active as they get older, as well as to be offered a range of retirement options and to be integrated into the wider life of society.
Europe needs to stop talking in pessimistic terms about the future and instead to seize all the new opportunities for building the dynamic and inclusive society that the Lisbon Strategy is designed to bring about.
Â Â  â Mr President, one year on from the mid-term review of the Lisbon Agenda, it is time to ask once more what stage Europe has reached.
Unfortunately, the answer to this question is a sobering one; following the political shock administered by the ânoâ vote against the constitution, we now face the threat of economic paralysis, of Lisbon becoming, like the celebrated woman without the lower half of her body, an attraction in a freak show, for, despite the consensus that the strategyâs implementation is the responsibility of the Member States, it is these that we see committing protectionist fouls in the name of economic patriotism, and this is cause for considerable concern.
Those who imagine that we could achieve âmore Lisbonâ or become more competitive with less of an internal market have either lost their grip on reality or are being dishonest.
Europeâs economic success over the last fifty years was founded upon the four freedoms of the internal market, three of which are now in acute danger.
This began two years ago when, among others, Germany and Austria imposed restrictions on the mobility of labour from the Member States in the east of the EU.
It now turns out that countries that did not interfere in labour mobility, such as Great Britain, can testify to the benefits of this.
Let us consider the free movement of capital.
Italy is forbidding the purchase of interests in Italian banks; Poland is opposing the merger of UniCredit and HBV; the French and the Spanish are resisting the takeover of domestic energy suppliers.
That is particularly ironic in view of the fact that it is in the energy sector that a European approach is called for, for are we to believe that we can have a common energy policy without an internal market in energy?
The Commissionâs unambiguous words on this subject are much to be welcomed, and it is to be hoped that the Council will follow its recommendations.
The third freedom, of the provision of services, is also at risk.
What the watering-down of the Services Directive perpetrated by Germany, Belgium and France means is nothing more or less than that the division of labour in this area is not yet forthcoming.
Were this to apply to the movement of goods, it would mean, for example, that Renault would be allowed to export its cars to Germany only if they were, once there, to cost no more or less than a Volkswagen.
And what are we to think of Skoda?
Workers in MladÃ¡ Boleslav earn less than their counterparts who assemble Audis or CitroÃ«ns; is that social dumping too?
The logical consequence of the trade unionsâ arguments on the services directive is that they should call for punitive customs duties on industrial products from Member States where wages are lower, and it is only a matter of time before they do that.
I might add that, if you consider the issue consistently, the demands made of the new Member States that they should increase their taxes on enterprises amount to precisely the same thing.
Lisbon is no more an end in itself than is the internal market.
What is needed at the heart of the continent of Europe is new growth, and more of it, if the millions of unemployed are to have new hope for the future.
Giving them that is a matter of obligation â politically, socially, and, in the final analysis, morally.
Jeopardising the internal market is a sin against the unemployed of Europe, to whom we have obligations, in that it is for their sakes, for the sake of the weakest members of our society, that we have to make Lisbon a success.
The same is true in the case of older people; this Houseâs resolution stresses the significance of demographic change, and both the elderly of today and those of tomorrow merit our attention.
Growth is what is needed to stabilise our social security systems; redistribution alone will not do the job.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Winkler, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Verheugen, I am an ecologist but I am not going to talk to you about energy.
I have colleagues, whom you know and who are very skilled in that area.
I should like to talk to you about the Commissionâs role in the Lisbon Strategy.
On many occasions, you have rightly emphasised the fact that, in order for this strategy to succeed, broad popular support is required, as is the proper involvement of all the relevant players, including the national parliaments.
With this in mind, the Commission needs, I believe, to send out two clear messages.
The first consists in saying that the Lisbon Strategy is not synonymous with unbridled competition between the Member States.
Instead, we champion a model of cooperation and solidarity between the Member States.
The second message consists in saying that, in a European Union of 25 Member States, there can be no first and second class citizens or workers.
I shall now give you three practical examples, in connection with which I should expect you to communicate a more proactive stance.
Firstly, the free movement of workers.
You have referred to this and published a report â which is all very commendable - and you are very pleased that a number of nations have fallen in with the line taken by the Commission.
I should expect both the President of the Commission and the College of Commissioners to act in the interests of the European Union by politely telling those states that do not wish to fall in with the Commission or that are reticent about doing so that they are going down the wrong road.
I turn now to my second example. On the subject of the Services Directive, Parliament rejected the country of origin principle (or COP).
What was the problem with this principle?
It was an unwillingness to organise the single market by having insufficiently harmonised national rules compete against each other.
In order to reassure workers, you should now state clearly that Portuguese, Germans and Slovaks working on a building site in Poland must receive the same salaries, and vice versa.
In other words, the Posting of Workers Directive must be strengthened, and it is your prerogative to do that.
Now for my third example. When it comes to the issue of taxation development in Europe, the Commission has made progress on the matter of harmonising the tax base within the framework of business taxation.
In 2007-2008, you are to lodge a report on the European Unionâs budget and future resources.
You should have the political will and the courage to say â and this is a matter broached by other Members â that it is unacceptable for the budget to be reduced to the point where the budget envisaged for young students or young workers is cut by a third.
In other words, MrÂ Barroso, I expect you, in implementing the Lisbon Strategy, not merely to take refuge behind the Member States, even if they have an important role to play. I expect you, instead, to go beyond your role of honest broker and, because you have a monopoly on legislative initiatives, genuinely to find the strength to champion European interests, which are threatened by the tendency for nations increasingly to withdraw into themselves.
Â Â  â The time has come to listen to the protests and the struggle against the neoliberal measures contained in the newly-reviewed Lisbon Strategy, the consequences of which have been at variance with what was promised in 2000 at the Lisbon Summit.
With the liberalisation of the markets, the privatisation of public services and the promotion of the flexibility of the labour market, or flexisecurity as the Commission now calls it, being stepped up, what we have seen is lower economic growth, higher unemployment, more precarious work, more poverty and greater inequality in the distribution of wealth, in the name of competitiveness and free competition.
It is clearer now that the two core pillars of neoliberal policies are the Stability and Growth Pact and the so-called Lisbon Strategy, not to mention the swingeing cuts to Community funds, which have served to turn economic and social cohesion into nothing more than a mirage.
Consequently, as we suggest in the resolution that we tabled, it is vital that the Lisbon Strategy be replaced by a European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development, which will promote investment in research and innovation with the aim of balanced and long-lasting development, in the quality of work in all its aspects, in improving qualifications, in basic infrastructure for supporting industry, in public services, in environmental protection and environmental technology, especially in energy and transport, in improving labour, social, environmental and security laws, in order to achieve harmonisation at the highest levels, and in the social economy.
A new social policy agenda is also required, with a view to developing a society ...
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Barroso wants the European Union to engage with civil society; MrÂ Winkler wants to motivate EU citizens.
But there is nothing more likely to cause observers of the European Union to yawn or sigh or say, âoh, no, not again!â, than talk of the Lisbon Agenda.
Can we not accept that the Lisbon Strategy has sunk, just like the Stability Pact has sunk, which is most unfortunate because that is what underpins the euro currency?
If the Lisbon Strategy has not sunk, why do we keep needing to relaunch it?
We all want economic growth and jobs; we all want the economies of Europe to thrive.
However, it must be time to recognise that we do not have the right formula.
Rather than being the force that drives the necessary reforms, it is the EU with its endless regulations and interference that is holding back the economies of Europe.
Recent modest improvements in some European Union economies have been achieved the European Union.
They are more a result of global development.
The economies of the EU do not need a Lisbon Strategy: they need to be left alone to let markets work and to let entrepreneurs create jobs.
Can we not see that by continuing to talk about the Lisbon Strategy, the European Union is emphasising its own impotence?
Therefore I recommend a period of silence: stop talking about an agenda that, year after year, has been universally acknowledged as a failure.
Â Â  MrÂ President, following the review of the Lisbon process last year the hope arose that the strategy had acquired new vigour, but events of the last six months show that actual action to achieve the strategyâs goals continues to lag behind.
In assessing the Member Statesâ programmes for implementing the Lisbon Strategy, the European Commission talks about the duplication of efforts for achieving the Lisbon goals.
I believe that currently a major advance would be to succeed in reducing by at least half those efforts which are expended on avoiding the Lisbon tasks.
The most recent glaring example is the Services Directive, which had been intended to impart vital momentum to liberalising the internal market and increasing competitiveness, and also served as one of the foundation stones of the Lisbon Strategy.
The European Parliamentâs compromise text will be able to contribute little to energising the common market, at least not while the Lisbon Strategy is still in operation.
Similarly, in other spheres we increasingly find any changes and reforms being met by increasing social and political counter-action.
Enormous energy is expended on preserving the existing situation and restricting changes and reforms, but in fact reforms to the European Unionâs internal market and the intensification of its integration are the main steps that could bring about an environment conducive to implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
Little has so far been achieved to provide coordinated financial support for the Lisbon tasks.
During the passionate process of debating the financial framework, the representatives of the Member Statesâ governments did not have strategic considerations in mind, and the financial framework demonstrates only a very weak connection with the Lisbon tasks.
Similarly, little has been done to coordinate the use of the Structural Funds with the Lisbon priorities.
Use of the Structural Funds and closer coordination of the Lisbon Strategy ought to be achieved both at EU and Member State level by harmonising national development plans with the Lisbon Strategy implementation programmes.
At the basis of any strategy lies the ability to subordinate short-term interests to long-term tasks.
For this reason, achieving the Lisbon Strategy will also be dependent on how and when the Member States and the European Union as a whole manage to convince the citizens of the EU of the fact that without achieving the Lisbon Strategy in the long term it will not be possible to achieve the goals of growth and employment.
Â Â  Mr President, the Lisbon Strategy is meant to turn Europe into the worldâs strongest economy, and I believe that there is in this House a broad consensus about that goal, although I would question the way in which this is being achieved.
I cannot avoid the conclusion that Europe today is still far too much preoccupied with subsidies to the detriment of investment and innovation.
Not only the various Member States, but also the Commission, bear the burden of responsibility in this.
Whilst the Commission had proposed to double spending for science and development to EUR 10 billion per annum from 2007, the Council rejected this proposal on the grounds that that would have necessitated considerable cuts in agricultural subsidies, regional subsidies and also structural funds.
When I think of the European structural funds, I am automatically reminded of the bottomless pit of Wallonia, for example, to which annually, millions of euros are being siphoned, without this ever effecting any structural change, because this is being prevented by an all-pervading and corrupt .
This is now also being corroborated by various Wallonian politicians and prominent economists.
Now, along comes Mrs Danuta HÃŒbner, European Commissioner for Regional Policy, claiming that Wallonia manages to use the structural funds effectively and that the Wallonian projects are typical of the so-called remarkable structural changes that take place in that region.
Well, given that this is coming from someone who is partly responsible for the follow-up of the Lisbon Strategy, this puts a question mark over the whole thing.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by seizing this opportunity to thank my co-rapporteur Mr Goebbels most warmly for the good cooperation in the steering group, in which we succeeded in producing, for the plenary and for the Conference of Presidents, a draft that is the logical continuation of what we came out with last year when the mid-term review was under consideration.
As it did then, the House endorses the Commissionâs strategy.
We have, in particular, again made it clear that our ability to realise the other main objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in the way we want to is conditional upon growth and employment.
This House has also played its part in setting priorities, three of which are mentioned in our resolution, namely population change, energy policy and innovation.
My only complaint is about something that many speakers have already mentioned.
The strategic approach is not our main problem; the strategic approach is the right one.
Our problem is what happens at the end.
To put it in quite practical and quite blunt terms, what I see as the most negative aspect is what we always see happening when the European Council gets its hands on this issue: it decides on a good and substantially sound strategy, presents it at a press conference, and it ends up being written about.
The following day, or perhaps a couple of days later, the finance ministers turn up and take back what the European Council had resolved on.
That is a fundamental strategic problem, and I have no idea how we are to get on top of it; it plays a considerable part in fostering the perception held by some members of the European public that European policy is dishonest and to increasing public despair with Europe.
What must be spelled out at this summit is that we cannot apply double standards; on the contrary, policy as actually implemented must reflect the strategic guidelines.
The last issue I would like to address is that of how the impact of laws is to be assessed â something also mentioned in our resolution.
We would like to point out that we expect the impact assessment to include an independent factor, thus ensuring that the result really is neutral.
This is part of âbetter lawmakingâ, and this demand is addressed to the Commission.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, 2005 was the first year in which the revised Lisbon Strategy was implemented.
The strategy is now better known and has been debated in the Member States, and the national reform programmes have been adopted.
That is progress, but it is just about the only progress there has been.
Otherwise, MrÂ Winkler was very bold in stating just now that the Lisbon Strategy had been relaunched.
In fact, it is somewhat bogged down.
It is, as MrÂ Schulz said, held back by a tiny financial perspective and by anaemic growth within the eurozone, as well as by a flagrant lack of investment â both at European and Member State level â in the universities, research and innovation and lifelong learning.
In the same way, we are struggling to complete the trans-European networks, and renewable energy sources and biotechnologies are still the poor relations where our investment and research efforts are concerned.
Let us move up a gear, you said, MrÂ Barroso. Getting into first gear would be a start, I am inclined to reply.
If the Lisbon Strategy is to be a success, it needs resources, a coherent financial perspective with defined priorities, investment on the part of each Member State and a macroeconomic framework that genuinely supports growth.
As you said, MrÂ President, there is also, however, a need for people to take the Lisbon Strategy to heart.
If the growth strategy defined by the European Union is to succeed, it needs to be supported.
That is why we should be doubly mistaken to give up the social dimension of this strategy and let ourselves be taken down the road of all-out liberalisation, precarious employment, enfeebled social rights and undermined public services.
