Echoing your statement, you have yourself observed that we had a joint resolution from Parliament on this subject.
In the context of the various initiatives that you are announcing or that are under way, I should like to hear you say more about the responsibility you are going to have to assume as Commissioner and would ask you to tell us whether the proposals for directives you are preparing appear to you to be sufficient and commensurate with what is at stake, particularly on two points.
First of all, I am keen, in response to my Liberal fellow-MEP, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, to emphasise that rules are necessary because there are fraudsters.
If everyone were honest, there would be no need for rules.
Rules are needed, therefore, because of fraudsters, and rules that apply to everyone.
If we are to use directives as our instrument, we need extremely short transposition periods, and we need to make sure that all the Member States transpose these directives properly.
At repeated yearly and half-yearly intervals, your own services prepare evaluation reports on the strategy for the internal market and do not fail to note that a good many directives are not transposed.
I would therefore ask you if, in the case of subjects such as those we are discussing, legal instruments directly applicable to the Member States and without unduly long transposition periods might not be necessary. Otherwise, we shall be in danger of finding ourselves in the same type of situation in a yearâs, indeed in two yearsâ, time.
On this matter, I consider that you and the College have direct responsibility when it comes to the choice of tool.
I now come to my second point, and I have to say that I again deplore the fact that the Council is not presentÂ âÂ I do not understand why the Council is present on some occasions and not on othersÂ âÂ for I have already questioned the Irish Presidency about what it intended to do in this area.
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Finance Minister was very evasive in his reply, saying that if people wanted to commit fraud, it was difficult to stop them, an opinion that I obviously cannot share.
Where off shore centres are concerned, Commissioner, why not raise the issue of effective international regulation within the context of the WTO negotiations?
Indeed, the question has as much to do with world trade as with capital transactions.
A number of countries are requesting new WTO rules where financial services are concerned.
Do you not think that the European Union â the Council and the Commission â could take this debate to the WTO, where we have constraints in place?
Within the FATF, the OECD and United Nations committees, we have for years been discussing the problem of regulating off shore centres and, not to beat around the bush, of abolishing tax havens.
Do you not think that it is time to move up a gear, or do we still have to wait for another ten financial scandals?
Let me conclude, MrÂ President, by saying that, in my view, we have here a unique opportunity to show Europeans how useful the European Union is.
The Parmalat case is genuinely scandalous, as is the fact that the political authorities are not doing more and doing it more quickly, a course of action in which I would therefore encourage you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, the Parmalatcase, like the case in Italy, the case in the United States, or similar cases in Great Britain and France, is a sign of the crisis that has, for some time, been affecting multinational financial organisations.
At the root of this is the huge and terrible gap between the real economy and the speculative bubble: a virtual wealth in paper form that hugely exceeds real wealth, based on production and on investments.
There is another common thread to the cases referred to: that is to say the lack of, or insufficient, control by the qualified institutions: central banks, stock exchange monitoring commissions, credit institutes, professional inspection bodies.
It is not a coincidence that when savers and consumer associations place a question mark over these bodies, they always repeat the same refrain. They say that they were not aware of the true situation, that they were in the dark about such illegal rigging.
Alternatively, these institutions lie or the monitoring rules are so flexibleÂ âÂ and, therefore, not very preciseÂ âÂ that it is possible to interpret them in such a way that they enable major fraud.
In the first instance, this is done by savers/investors, maybe with the compliance of the banks themselves, a matter to which we have, moreover, already referred in several questions on the problem of the speculative bubble.
Although we spoke about this long before it burst, the European institutions also paid insufficient attention to it on this occasion.
I am talking about compliance because a further fact that emerges from these cases is the conflict of interest suffered by credit institutes, always to the detriment of investors.
In the preceding weeks, we had already presented a resolution to the Commission to get around the inadequate rules, in which we called for the initiative to be taken, at European level and for the purpose of protecting saversâ interests, to link all bodies charged with monitoring and controlling relations between businesses and banks and for an assessment to be made of the possibility of harmonising the current regulation in order to guarantee that ethical principles are applied, which means that inspectors must not be paid by those being monitored.
The notorious cases of illegality that are disastrously affecting the investments of hundreds of thousands of savers give us the opportunity to intervene on behalf of independent professional consultantsÂ âÂ whom we have already spoken about in this ParliamentÂ âÂ and to urge the Commission to look into the possibility of creating a European register of such professionals. On the one hand, to try to resolve the serious issue of the conflict of interest by reducing the banksâ monopoly on advice and, on the other hand, to aim for a high quality professional qualification based on ethics and on proven experience in the sector in question.
What we call for measures to support all Parmalatworkers and to compensate savers that were defrauded, in some cases, twiceÂ âÂ not only by Parmalatbut also by those who advised them to make certain investments.Â We believe, however, that the Union must seriously face up to other potentially disastrous new consequences of the enormous gap between the real economy and the financial economy.
Until measures are taken to reduce this gap, the risks will continue to loom.
Â Â  MrÂ President, setting up a Committee of Inquiry, which the European Parliament is calling for, could provide those useful elements that we did not find were sufficiently expressed in the motion for resolution, and give some specific and precise guidelines as to the instruments needed to prevent the reoccurrence of cases such as that of Parmalat.
We believe that five billion bonds were issued by ParmalatFinance,based in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, by a company with a modest capital of just a few thousand euro.
In actual fact, they were not real bonds, but promissory notes, that some banksÂ âÂ including some very well-known onesÂ âÂ recommended from their counters to their clientsÂ âÂ keeping quiet about their true nature which they could not, however, have not known about.
As regards better informing the signatories, specific rules need to be provided for: the forms should contain a concise description of the product, and our request is that they also contain a report on the risk factor, specifying the characteristics of the bonds, something that is not currently planned for.
There is still the issue of compensation.
There is no point crying over spilt milk, we must think about recuperating the misappropriated sums and giving specific guarantees to savers in the case of collapse.
Why do banks not have to respond directly and straight away when they have advised people, even shortly before a collapse, to buy âjunk bondsâ?
In corporate meetings, shareholders can also have a role to play in terms of monitoring but, because this is effective, there must be provision for it to be obligatory to publish the minutes in an information pamphlet on the measure that is the subject of the meeting.
In the case in question, officials are already reporting huge difficulties in recuperating the sums, for example in US banks, because today US regulations allow US creditors to get preferential treatment.
Genuine reciprocity therefore needs to be established between Europe and the United States in processes to confiscate assets and capital earned from activities involving financial crime.
In an economic democracy, which is achieved through worker participation, why not provide for an obligation to have a representation, with a monitoring function too, of workers/shareholders on company boards of listed companies?
Â Â  Mr President, as we have heard, the Parmalat case was a catastrophe for its employees, for investors, for savers, for its creditors, for its customers and indeed for the financial markets.
It is our duty as legislators and policy-makers to see how we should respond to that and to see what we can do to try and prevent that kind of catastrophe from occurring again.
How can we ensure that the whistle is blown on this type of criminal conduct before it reaches the catastrophic and disastrous proportions that it reached at Parmalat, before it goes on for years, as it apparently did at Parmalat?
I appeal to the House to ensure that our response is proportionate, is measured, and looks at the facts of what happened in a dispassionate way, that we have a thorough analysis of what happened, of what went wrong â if anything â with the regulatory system, and of how we can improve the legal and regulatory framework to try to prevent a Parmalat from happening again.
We can be proud of the fact that this process started before Parmalat happened because, as people have said, there have been scandals throughout the world.
Enron is the biggest, but there are others throughout the European Union.
Few people were foolish enough to say 'well, Enron happened in the USA and we do not have any problems in the European Union'.
If they said that they are obviously feeling rather foolish about it now, but that was not the general response here and in the Member States to the Enron crisis.
We looked at what happened and responded to it.
That will help us because we have prepared the ground to try to tackle a similarly disastrous event within the European Union itself.
As many people have mentioned, we need to look at the role played by the professionals â the bankers, the auditors, the ratings agencies â that were involved with Parmalat, to see if in the future there is some way of ensuring that they are not taken in, that they are able to assist savers and investors in detecting this kind of fraud, and that they are properly regulated; and to examine whether further regulation would ensure that they are better able to detect this kind of fraud.
But we should not make the mistake of trying to turn auditors and lawyers and ratings agencies into policemen, because that simply would not work.
We need also to accept that the kind of obvious criminal and fraudulent conduct that we saw in the Parmalat case is something that can never be eliminated completely.
No matter how effective and wide-ranging our system of regulation, you are always going to get fraudsters and criminals who will break the rules.
We must focus on better enforcement of the rules and regulations that we have.
In many ways, that is a question for Member States.
They need to devote many more resources to their police forces, particularly those specifically dealing with financial crime.
That is one of the biggest lessons we can learn from Parmalat.
We do not necessarily need to introduce a whole range of new regulation, which may in the end just prove to be a burden on those many market participants who are completely honest.
We need more cooperation between our national regulators, not a single European Union regulator.
The Member States should devote more resources to fighting financial crime and having a large, effective police force to fulfil that task in the future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the Enron affairÂ âÂ and this is one of the points on which I agree with MrsÂ VilliersÂ âÂ a number of people in Europe thought that this sort of thing was a feature of American, but not of European, capitalism.
Well, the Parmalat affair demonstrates that wayward developments of a similar kind are not alien to twenty-first century European capitalism.
We are, in fact, confronting something with implications far beyond those of the Parmalat case and concerning the adjustment of tools that, in reality, we have not basically altered since the nineteenth century, whereas the nature of capitalism has, for its part, changed so much.
In the nineteenth century, capital and labour were the opposing forces in companies.
Since then, capital has dispersed and, with great ingenuity, has discovered a thousand and one ways of making its presence felt. Meanwhile, there is no European or world market for labour, which continues to rely on its strength alone.
We are concerned with four major problems: the issue of tax havens, that of the way in which capital is organised, that of the separation between financing and production and, finally, that of the fate of salaried and other employees.
Nothing less.
In this regard, I would thank you, Commissioner, for the proposals you are putting forward, for they are a small seed planted on the long road towards regulating world capitalism.
That being said, I should like to emphasise two or three difficulties arising, in my view, from the proposals you have made.
I take it that you do not share the view of MrsÂ Villiers, for whom the regulation of capitalism would require nothing more than having a policeman looking over the shoulders of every banker.
As for myself, I agree with her on one point: there will always be scoundrels.
There are, and always will be, scoundrels in the field of marine transport, and so too are there scoundrels in the financial sphere, which will never be rid of them.
The thing is, not to give them a helping hand.
At present, modern capitalism operates in such a way as to offer lifelines to the bad boys of the financial world. They take the form of tax havens, tax fraud and indecipherable capital structures.
What we have the task of combating is this indecipherability, which prevents us from arresting those who are guilty.
That is why we have to conduct a determined struggle against these tax havens by stepping up the pressure through every means at our disposal, whether it be embargoes or boycotts.
If one country is boycotted because it does not respect human rights, why not boycott another for drawing a veil over fraudulent capitalist wheeler-dealing?
It seems to me that this is worth thinking about.
Moreover, if there is a real desire to achieve transparency, a say must be given to those able to act as a counterbalance.
Indeed, you cannot have ambitions to improve the way in which the operation of companies is regulated without granting more say to salaried and other employees.
That applies to the debate we have had on MrÂ Katiforisâ report on rating agencies, and it also applies to the issue of the takeovers on which our Parliament has deliberated, not forgetting the issue of company boards of directors.
On the latter point, it seems to me, Commissioner, that the document you have submitted to us, concerned with corporate governance, still falls far short of what we need.
In conclusion, I wish to point out that the life of companies is too important a matter to be left to financiers alone.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Parmalatcase is difficult to solve because we have not got to the bottom of the responsibilities and complex and ambiguous mechanisms that allowed it to happen.
To consider it to be just an Italian scandal is a limited outlook.
It is, in fact, an international affair of vast proportions, in which internationally important banks are involved.
The losses that savers have had to endure are, however, very clear to everyone.
It is them that we must think about and we must look into, and encourage, the application of adequate measures, such as specific types of insurance, able to indemnify small-time savers involved in the collapse.
Moreover, what has been described as the largest financial and accounting fraud ever registered in Europe dramatically highlighted the serious lack of rigorous and effective rules that are capable of preventing cases of the falsification of company accounts which, in accordance with a recent Italian law, have been decriminalised.
It is essential that, in a common market such as the European one where the Treaties state that the constitutional principles of free circulation of people, goods, capital and services apply, the Commission intervene in order to give greater protection to citizens against this type of fraud, and that it does so through Community measures that are capable of stepping up the monitoring of accounts audits for Union companies.
This, however, is not enough. , chaired by MrÂ Di Pietro and part of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, calls for strict rules to be established at European level to prevent any type of unfair economic or financial assistance at a company or individual level among companies active in the 25 Member States and structures operating tax havens in ârogue statesâ.
In particular, a strict economic embargo, binding in this sense, would force the whole of the international community, including the USA, to act in an honest manner, so as to be able to prevent the reoccurrence of unfortunate episodes such as those that we have been talking about.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, for years, the boss of Parmalat had to use the same language to his 36Â 000 employees, scattered among thirty countries, as all bosses use to their workers.
They had to be told that it was impossible to increase their salaries, that staff numbers had to be reduced and that this was required in the interests of the competitiveness needed.
Well, the workers of this company have seen how crude these lies were.
They see they have been duped.
How many salaries could have been increased with the EURÂ 14Â billion that their boss embezzled?
How many supposedly necessary redundancies could have been avoided?
The last straw is that all those who have been complicit in these instances of embezzlementÂ âÂ the banks and administrationsÂ âÂ will continue as before, while the companyâs 36Â 000 workers are in danger of losing their livelihoods, and thousands of small dairy farmers are affected.
Among the companies you claim are in the majority in behaving ethically and honestly, how many other Parmalats are there, however, that have still not been unmasked?
How, moreover, is it possible to find out?
How might people distinguish bosses on the make from those who claim not to be and, alongside the open gangster-style practices of the Parmalat bosses and of very many others, is it not, in reality, all large companies that engage in the hoodlum-like practice â legal in this case â of closing a factory by throwing the workers out on their ear, simply in order to make additional capital gains on the stock exchange?
Your laws give bosses and boards of directors dictatorial power over their companies.
We are in favour of workers, consumers and the population being able to control companies, their accounts, the ways in which they realise their profits and the ways in which they use them.
The community needs to be able to monitor companies on an ongoing basis and prohibit decisions that are clearly contrary to its interests.
Tax havens do not exist only in the Bahamas.
To abolish them here in Europe, banking and commercial secrecy needs to be abolished.
Â Â  Mr President, there are some cases where Europe is really needed, when swiftness of action is especially important and crucial in order to establish whether our institutions are really in a position to interpret the needs of citizens.
This must be done in a visible and decisive manner.
Of course, we are not the United States, Commissioner Bolkestein; our capacity for action is more limited, since it is restricted by national rivalries and various rights of veto, especially in those sectors that we are currently dealing with.
We believe, however, that there is room for manoeuvre in the case of Parmalatand the Commission must use this.
Basically, we need to move in three directions, which have, moreover, already been mentioned.
Firstly, the Commission must put forward proposals on the behaviour of companies when they operate in tax havens to hide their dirty money.
We believe that EU legislation can be put in place to attempt to curb and prevent this, because this was indeed one of the fundamental causes of the events at Parmalat.
This, Commissioner Bolkestein, goes far beyond a proposal on money laundering.
I am afraid that, in order to genuinely be on the side of consumers and savers, especially in such a politically sensitive period, the Commission should formulate a proposal that visibly supports them and that â I repeat â goes far beyond the proposals that have been presented today.
Secondly, I would be pleased if Commissioner Bolkestein put forward a proposal to ensure that EU countries controlling these tax havens, that have access to them or that have particularly lax legislation in place on this issue, can be persuaded in some way to change course.
Thirdly â as my colleague, Mr Jonckheer, has already said â what does Commissioner Bolkestein think of presenting the position of the European Union on these issues to the World Trade Organisation?
Â Â  Mr President, as fellow Members have already said, the financialcollapse of the multinational Parmalat has constituted a very serious episode for Italy and has involved thousands of small Italian savers; it is likely to damage financial credibility and, in future, to create widespread distrust of our country amongst international investors too.
One of the causes of this financial collapse was, primarily the approval of the false financial statements of the Parmalat Group by one of the major auditing companies, which is alleged to have hidden the real asset situation of the company.
What is more, it is obvious that the other bodies employed for financial auditing â and â also failed to conduct the necessary inspections adequately and at the right time.
Several of the most well-known credit institutes in global financial markets â both Italian and EuropeanÂ âÂ also appear to be involved in the affair; they issued an uncontrolled amount ofbonds that are no longer redeemable.
For all these reasons, the Parmalat case has been described as the European , although, in fact, it is more serious than the US scandal, since US GDP is much higher than that of Italy.
As we all know, the Parmalat collapse is, unfortunately, merely the latest in a long series of similar affairs that have occurred across Europe.
So what can Italian citizens and European citizens, who are often the victims of this financial adventurism, expect?
I think that they expect urgent and tangible measures, both to protect the workers in the Parmalat Group, which is the specific case in point, and â more generally â to safeguard and compensate the savers involved in this collapse.
Furthermore, they expect instruments to be put in place to prevent operations of this sort occurring in the future and to restrict the maximum exposure of small savers.
Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner to two final points: I think that the time has come to create an establishment for monitoring and control at European level â a sort of European Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) â with the right to inspect and impose sanctions, under the direct control of the ECB, and designed to verify the efficiency and transparency of the equity market in order to protect investors as far as possible.
Lastly, a black list should be established to ensure that tax havens are outlawed.
Â Â  Commissioner Bolkestein, I welcome the initiatives that you announced beforehand and those that have been taken recently.
Credit is due to you for declaring, right in the middle of the affair, that Europe was not immune to that type of scandal.
I would like to make it clear to everybody that the Parmalat scandal is not about a sound company destroyed by financial wrongdoing; unfortunately for Italy, the Parmalat scandal is a case of a fraudulent and inefficient business that someone tried to save through financial wrongdoing.
Today, quite rightly, we have been talking at length about controls.
I think that the issue that needs to be faced is that of the role of central banks in individual States.
Italy has given its central bank certain powers as regards competition, and therefore antitrust lawsand plays a fundamental role in the running of banking activities and, as a result of those banking activities, in the industrial system as a whole.
I think that this is an anomaly that needs to be eliminated and that Europe, the European Central Bank, the Commission and the Council must take measures to that effect.
I also think that we have to act extremely cautiously, in response to the Parmalat scandal, when it comes to balancing controls and sanctions.
It is all very well to increase controls, but we should not attempt to impose impossible restrictions on the financial market, which is crucial to Europeâs economic development.
We are also looking at sanctions that, in the same way as controls, will serve to discourage fraudulent behaviour.
In particular, we need to give consumers an important tool, class action, on the basis of Article 153 of the Treaty, which would be useful in discouraging fraudulent behaviour in any quarter.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first we had Enron and WorldCom.
Now, with Parmalat, Europe has caught a cold.
The simple fact is that there are criminals everywhere.
There are not only good people, there are also bad people, and we have made laws against bad people.
Unfortunately, bad people sometimes break laws.
That is why I do not see any point in reinventing the wheel now and considering yet again if we should perhaps forbid such things yet again.
They were already forbidden.
What we need is a rational analysis to establish where there may have been shortcomings in the supervisory system and what scope there is for fine-tuning legislation.
I am very grateful, especially in the light of the statements made by the Commissioner and the Commission's proposals, which we are already aware of, that unlike America we in Europe do not intend to overreact but that we are instead trying, by means of individual measures, to improve the existing legal position.
Our objective is not to totally prevent such things happening in future â that would be impossible â but to make them less likely.
I believe that the proposals made by the Winter Committee in the Winter II Report aim very much in this direction.
The Commission's Action Plan on company law has taken on board the essence of the proposals made in the Winter II Report.
I do not wish to go into detail, for the simple reason that the Commission's Action Plan on company law is being dealt with by means of a special consultation involving a separate report to Parliament.
I would just like to refer to two points, by way of example.
I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission is now to bring forward the Eight Directive in the foreseeable future, but I believe that regardless of the many good ideas it contains, we should perhaps consider if certain aspects could not be made a little more consistent.
I think it is outrageous that it will still be possible for audit companies to both provide consultancy and carry out audits for large quoted companies, in Europe at least.
I stand by the principle that if you audit you cannot advise, and if you advise you cannot audit.
It would not in any case affect the market at all, because the cake would remain just as big, it would simply be sliced up differently.
Against that background I very much welcome the fact that legislative proposals drawn up in America will also have an impact on international audit companies operating over here in Europe.
In other areas I sometimes doubt whether the Commission's proposals make sense, for example the requirement in the transparency directive for mandatory quarterly reporting by companies throughout Europe.
On that point I would just like to comment that companies like Enron, WorldCom and others all submitted such quarterly reports.
Unfortunately, they were all false.
That is why I do not believe that this instrument is really helpful.
It is not a question of providing information overload, but one of obtaining the correct information that investors require for decision making.
I shall conclude on that note and thank you for your attention.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his âA Short History of Financial Euphoriaâ, John Kenneth Galbraith denounced the belief according to which, and I quote, âeconomic success and intelligence go hand in handâ.
The Parmalat affair is the perfect illustration of this because the founder of Parmalat appeared to have economic success.
The financial world, the media and political circles were satisfied with the appearance of success, and neither the auditors, nor the bankers, nor the rating agencies, nor even the Italian regulators questioned the accounts published by Parmalat.
The list of companies that have deployed, above all, their criminal intelligence to deceive euphoric financial markets has become extremely long in recent years.
From Enron to Parmalat, there is no end of apparently respectable companies that have ended up by massaging their accounts so as not to suffer setbacks on the stock exchange.
All these financial scandals are the product of the belief, spread by the markets, according to which it is possible, at no risk, to become very rich in a very short space of time.
Now, large profits are generally the result of taking large risks and, when the risks produce not profits but losses, there is a great temptation temporarily to hide those losses in order quickly to offset them by a profit based on still greater risk-taking.
By mobilising all the resources of financial engineering, losses are allocated to special vehicles, turnover inflated through phoney operations, such as Parmalatâs phantom sale of milk powder to the Cuban regime, and non-existent profits shown thanks to creative accounting.
Faced with these scandals, the business world is still affected by the same short-sightedness.
I was Parliamentâs rapporteur for the Directive on market abuse and insider dealing.
In that role, I asked around in financial circles and received an impressive number of lobbyists.
Often â in fact, too often â I heard, at that time, that Enron was only an isolated case and a product of the irrational exuberance of the American market, but that Europe was quite different.
We now know that criminal energy is divided equally between the two sides of the Atlantic.
There is only one way of preventing financial scandals.
Europe, the United States, Japan and all the important financial centres must cooperate.
Transparency is needed, together with a constraining regulatory framework imposed also upon tax havens, offshore centres and other black holes of international finance.
It is not a question of banning the Caribbean or Pacific islands from playing with the big boys and offering facilities to the business world, but of prohibiting the big American, European and Japanese banks from financing anything through bogus companies situated in unsupervised and unregulated islands, if these banks are unable to guarantee that these operations are lawful.
The tool for achieving this should consist of new rules governing thecapital adequacy for banks, that is to say what is known in our jargon as the Basel II agreement.
Conflicts of interest between the various supervisory and auditing functions etc. should also be avoided, but it is not a question of punishing the banks and other financial operators.
Especially if we want it to have a social dimension, the market economy needs enterprising entrepreneurs and innovative financial circuits to fund them, but everything must be done to manage these markets in such a way as to ensure that employees, subcontractors, suppliers and shareholders do not become the victims of financial crime operating under the cloak of respectability.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Bolkestein, ladies and gentlemen, the Parmalat collapse and other worrying financial crises before and after it have revealed the limitations of the rules governing our financial markets.
As happened in the United States, on the crest of the affair, and in the United Kingdom, with its 34 defaulting scandals, in Italy too we immediately realised the need to introduce strict legislation in order to protect savers more effectively and â in a broader sense â to attempt to limit the discredit that would inevitably affect the financial market involved.
In these cases, though, we have to put aside emotional reactions and, in particular, we should not allow ourselves to be swayed by the appearance, however serious, of what has occurred and by the incentives that may result from it.
Similarly, I do not support exceptional measures, such as the possibility of a monitoring super-authority, because we would run the risk of creating a new body that would have difficulty in making any additional contribution to an environment that must be restructured.
The measures in force have to be well implemented and certainly need to be redesigned.
The bankruptcy law could also play a key role: the principle and the âsuspect periodâ should also play a role in both extraordinary administration and controlled administration.
This would reinforce the protection of creditors.
Furthermore, the credit system, which is certainly not entirely blameless in the case of Parmalat, would not be the sole arbiter of events.
These would, however, be subject to the assessment of a designated judge.
So, to continue on the subject of far-reaching proposals, we would need to increase the information available on all financial products available to the public, both in prospectuses and in communications and to eliminate the problem of the patchiness of the information on the different financial products available to the public.
Transparency monitoring must be extended to everything, including banking and insurance products offered to savers, which contain a management input.
The introduction of stricter areas of incompatibility to protect the independence of inspection bodies will be inevitable.
In the case of bond-issuing firms, however, more needs to be done: documents binding on the company will need to be issued, stating what the company will do, when it will do it and what investment products will be used.
Above all, though, in addition to accounts auditors, we will need to put in place a figure that has already existed in the United States for ten years: the ethics officer.
This figure, who acts as a form of listener, or identifier of signals, must be able to pick up on even weak danger signals that escape the attention of analysts, who focus on evidence.
When reading the work of the ethics officer, it is possible to identify not only management results, but on the outside the extent of the firmâs reliability.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Europeâs Parmalat affair is no less devastating than the WorldCom case, the biggest US financial scandal to date.
Naturally, I am especially concerned because the Parmalat scandal also involved an Austrian company.
We have been discussing European audit mechanisms and financial legislation ever since the major scandals started in the US some three years ago.
Unfortunately, it is still the case that some people want more controls, and others want less.
On this issue â this objective issue â there is very little middle ground; instead, what we have is, in my view, a farcical political polarisation.
Only yesterday, we were debating the issue of the ratings agencies.
As usual in such situations, the conservatives voted against better and more stringent control mechanisms and thus accepted the audit and evaluation oligopoly as it stands, without particular comment.
How should we view this situation from our perspective? That is a matter of taste.
We will soon have the opportunity to vote on the directive on cross-border mergers of companies with share capital.
It is already becoming apparent that there is an intention to steer this directive away from workersâ interests and better control mechanisms.
Yet the current financial regulations in the EU enable financial systems that lack transparency to pursue fraudulent policies.
Tax havens continue to be maintained, even though there have for years been calls for us to regulate them.
It is quite unacceptable for Europeâs regulatory and control mechanisms to have as many holes as a Swiss cheese, opening the door to fraud.
If we fail to take action now, we will forfeit the confidence of the workers who are now losing their jobs, as well as the investors in the capital markets â confidence that we want to secure.
Â Â  Mr President, the Parmalat scandal comprises a series of quite distinct crises.
Firstly, there has been fraud of gargantuan proportions; secondly, there is a systemic crisis in the market place, and, thirdly, there is a very considerable social disaster in Italy, where most of those affected are living.
I do not want to make any more remarks about either the fraud or the problems there may be in Italy.
I would prefer to talk about its effect on the markets.
We sometimes forget that one of the lessons of the twentieth century was the clear emergence of the evidence to support the view that markets are the best driver of prosperity and the best creator of jobs that we have seen in the world.
It is therefore clear that the proper working of markets is essential to our collective future wellbeing.
Those markets must be arranged so that criminality is difficult.
However, just as it is impossible to organise the City of Strasbourg to make it impossible to be mugged, equally, it is impossible to organise the financial markets to ensure that there is no outside possibility of criminal fraud taking place.
We should recognise that.
Secondly, it is important that investors have confidence in the market.
The claims and evidence that companies produce about themselves should be transparent, and the rules about the way in which that information is put together should be unimpugnable.
I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein's remarks on his review of auditing and auditing standards.
Equally, the governance of companies in the marketplace should be beyond reproach in terms of the way in which decisions are made.
Again, I welcome the Commissioner's remarks in his statement.
Furthermore, the claims that are made in the market and the advice that is given to possible participants in it must be such that there is no suggestion of impropriety.
I must ask â and perhaps I say this as someone who is not standing in the forthcoming elections â can the same be said about the claims that the political parties are going to make in the forthcoming contest?
We must not forget either that even in the case of apparent large-scale losses by banks, it may well be that in a world where private provision of pensions is going to become increasingly the norm, it is the small people who get hurt by these disasters.
It is the confidence of the small investor â either directly or through pension funds â which is so important for the workings of twenty-first century capitalism.
Many speakers have mentioned regulation.
Regulation is the answer, but not over-regulation.
That must be the lesson that we draw from this crisis.
Â Â  . I should like to begin by thanking Members of Parliament for their comments on what I said at the start of this debate, as well as for all other remarks made about this important issue.
I would like to pick up on a few points at the closure of this debate in view of the importance of the subject.
Firstly, I should like to say something on a truly important aspect of this case: offshore tax havens and special purpose vehicles.
The full complexity of the situation in the case of Parmalat, as regards the use of offshore financial centres and special purpose vehicles, still has to be clarified.
It is clear that the time has come to introduce some real order here.
All these types of special operations ought to be subject to three requirements: firstly, they ought to be listed in company accounts; secondly, the company concerned should explain its purpose â why does that company have these special purpose vehicles? â and thirdly, the group auditor ought to be made responsible for checking that what is supposed to be there really is there.
There must be greater control over these highly complex corporate structures.
Along the same lines, the Commission will consider increased disclosure requirements in the context of the amendments to the fourth and seventh company law directives.
These amendments are due to be adopted by September 2004.
The question of the transparency of corporate vehicles and other legal arrangements is under consideration by the Commission, both internally within the European Union and also in the wider international context.
Secondly, I would like to say something on auditing.
It might well be asked whether there is a systemic failure of the audit function; although I believe that the auditor has an important role to play in ensuring proper financial reporting, it is not the only factor under scrutiny.
It is important to take a broader picture of the responsibilities for financial reporting and the functioning of capital markets.
Apart from auditors, we should also question the role of management, of non-executive directors, of corporate governance arrangements, of credit rating agencies â as mentioned this afternoon- and of investment banks.
With regard to auditors, I believe there is a need for a stronger backbone to resist improper accounting and undue commercial pressure by the audited entities.
Several measures that the Commission will propose in its forthcoming directive should help auditors keep their backs straight; for example, independence requirements, strong public oversight, communication with audit committees and serious external quality reviews.
We may also ask whether there is an accounting issue.
Apparently, the existing legislation in Italy on annual accounts requires neither a cashflow statement, nor much information about financial derivatives and their impact on the financial position.
The fair value accounting directive, adopted in 2001, has been in force since 1 January 2004.
That directive requires detailed disclosure about financial instruments such as the fair value of financial instruments, information about their extent and nature, and a table showing the movements in fair value.
Annual accounts, prepared on the basis of international accounting standards, which require a cashflow statement and also fair values, would have better reflected Parmalat's true financial position and might have prevented fraud, at least on the scale which occurred.
Then there is the question of corporate governance.
Paragraph 7 of the resolution states that the political guidelines of the action plan on corporate governance are based mainly on transparency and disclosure.
That is perfectly true, there are important transparency and disclosure initiatives, but the action plan also contains significant initiatives that are introduced via directives: it suggests appropriate and proportionate binding rules, for example on shareholders' rights and also on directors' liability.
Regarding independent directors, the action plan announces a recommendation aimed at fostering their role, at least on a comply-or-explain basis.
It is therefore true that disclosure is key.
But consultations on the action plan have shown that it is doubtful whether an approach based on binding rules on the composition and role of board committees would make much sense.
Lastly, to wind up this important debate, I should like to quote Mr Fava, who said that we need 'global rules'.
I agree.
It is not so easy to achieve global rules.
Mention was made of the WTO: that is a possibility.
The OECD does a lot of work in this area and we should be careful not to get ahead of ourselves.
I should therefore like to support the OECD as much as possible in its work.
Mr Jonckheer said that this is a golden opportunity to show citizens what we are here for.
He is right because, as many participants in this debate have said, it is the small people who get hurt first and who lose their pension rights or their jobs.
We must make clear that the European Union is taking the necessary steps in order to put a halt to this kind of practice and the forthcoming parliamentary elections perhaps offer a good opportunity to do so.
Mr Jonckheer also asked whether directors will be up to the task.
That is a very relevant question.
Are the measures taken by the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament sufficient?
As Mr Lehne and Lord Inglewood have said, one cannot give any guarantees.
It is impossible to give guarantees that something of this nature will not occur â guarantees only exist for vacuum cleaners!
That is something we cannot do, but we can make it very difficult for people with ill intentions seeking to continue their work.
We are a little bit between the devil and the deep blue sea, on the one hand between Mr Jonckheer, who says we should make sure this sort of thing does not happen any more and, on the other hand, Mr Della Vedova, Mr Lehne and Lord Inglewood, who say it is impossible to completely avoid criminal fraud.
However, we can make it harder.
The actions undertaken by the Commission and by the European Union do indeed make it much harder for this sort of thing to happen again.
I hope that all Members of this Parliament will join the Commission in making clear to the electorate that the Commission is doing its job and that Members of the European Parliament are also doing their jobs in order to prevent this sort of thing from happening again.
Â Â  Mr President, it is just a question of clarification.
Commissioner, at the beginning of your speech, you spoke about offshore banking and you listed some criteria.
Does this mean that you are going to present legislation on that?
Â Â  . Mr President, as I said the key sentence is: 'It is clear that the time has come to put some real order here.'
I mentioned three demands to be formulated: the special operations should be listed in company accounts; their purpose should be explained â why the company has them at all; and the group auditor must be responsible for checking.
We are considering stronger disclosure requirements in amendments to the fourth and seventh Company Law Directives to be adopted in September, but I do not know whether those amendments are sufficient to control the whole business of offshore tax havens and special purpose vehicles.
However, these three requirements which I have just formulated certainly must be met and we must find a way of doing this.
Â Â  To conclude this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions from six political groups.(1)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  .
I take the point made by the Member.
I am not sure whether one could attach the term 'provisional'.
The presidency is aware that these proposals could have an impact on the social fabric, particularly in regions such as Andalusia.
We are very concerned about that.
The presidency is aware of the concerns of producer Member States that, if alternative enterprises are not available for farmers who are in receipt of decoupled or partly-decoupled payments, they could opt out of production altogether and that would leave the area with resulting damage to the rural fabric. I believe that is the point of the Member's question.
The Commission has taken this into consideration in formulating its proposals.
It proposes that a percentage of the producers' support expenditure be retained as national envelopes to address such problems.
So there is an element of contingency built into the proposals.
The Council will look closely at those elements of the Commission's proposals and will try to find a compromise solution that will be acceptable to producer Member States. As I have said, the Irish presidency is particularly aware of this type of potentially negative regional impact.
We are very concerned that it should be minimised.
In September 2001, the Eritrean Government banned independent newspapers.
Ten journalists, including Dawit Isaac, were imprisoned.
Dawit Isaac is both a Swedish and an Eritrean citizen and was one of the founders of Setit, Eritrea's first private newspaper.
The government in Eritrea refuses to say where Dawit and the others are.
According to the Eritrean Government, he is being held in custody for reasons of national security.
Dawit Isaac has not yet been allowed to meet representatives of the Swedish authorities and there is growing concern that he is not alive.

In what way is the Council prepared to exert pressure on the Eritrean Government to ensure that the fate of Dawit Isaac, an EU citizen, is clarified and his family and Swedish authorities are allowed to meet him?
Â Â  .
I am aware of this case.
The Council remains deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Eritrea in general, not just this specific case. The European Union's relations with the Eritrean Government have progressed over the last two years, after the difficult situation in late 2001, and a dialogue on the internal situation and on the peace process has been re-established.
That is very welcome.
In meetings at local level the heads of mission have expressed, on several occasions, the Union's concern at the imprisonment of a number of people â among them many journalists â and the suppression of the independent press. Requests that those arrested be either charged or released have been reiterated.
In October 2003 the Council welcomed the recent steps taken by the government of Eritrea to restore a climate of general communication and to develop a meaningful political dialogue with the Union. The EU also called upon the government to operationalise the dialogue, which is based on democracy, the rule of law and other essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement.
In this context the Council will continue to raise individual cases, such as the case mentioned, with the government of Eritrea.
I reiterate that the issue of detainees has been formally raised within the framework of political dialogue.
The Italian presidency specifically raised cases such as that of Mr Dawit Isaac â who is of dual nationality â directly with the Eritrean authorities.
The Irish presidency will do everything that it can to support the hard work of the Swedish authorities who have been attempting to secure information on â and, more importantly, access to â MrÂ Isaac.
Â Â  .
I can well understand the concerns here.
It has been some time since we have had news of Mr Isaac.
All I can do is reiterate the point I made: the Council reaffirms very much the European Union's commitment to and respect for human rights. In fact, as the Member mentioned, human rights are not determined geographically; they are a universal fact of life, and every state with which this Union has any contact must be aware of our concerns in this regard, particularly where a person holds dual nationality which involves them being a citizen of an EU Member State.
I can well appreciate and support the Member's comments.

Â Â  I would like offer my thanks and appreciation to Minister Roche for his comprehensive reply, which I welcome.

It is something that we will be able to refer to time and again in future.



I would like to say to the Minister that we must take into account, when dealing with South Africa, the fact that Zimbabwe is a country neighbouring South Africa and the political situation there is certainly a cause of very grave international concern and is an issue which has been raised on many occasions.

Could the presidency explain how it views the future relationship between South Africa and Zimbabwe, how it views the relationship between the EU and Zimbabwe, and could it say what effort the EU can make to bring about attitudinal change by the authorities in South Africa, to try and come to terms, in a pragmatic way, with the dreadful situation existing in Zimbabwe, which they have not yet faced up to?
Â Â  Question No 7 has been withdrawn.




A recent consumer survey organised by the Department of Agriculture and Food in Ireland reveals that most consumers want specific country of origin information in relation to all meat sales.

What is the Council's position on extending beef labelling regulations to the food service sector?



Â Â  . I am sure we would all join in sending good wishes and a speedy recovery to MrÂ Fitzsimons: a colourful man.
Mr Hyland asked a very important question, given some of the scares about foods, in general, and health risks. The Council is aware of the concerns that have been expressed by Mr Hyland.
However, a proposal from the Commission, which would provide the basis for a detailed examination by the Council, is still awaited. The question anticipates something that will happen.
I understand that shortly the Commission will submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the application of current rules on beef labelling that will examine, in particular, the issue raised.
The Council will then have the opportunity to discuss it in depth and will wish to ensure the greatest possible protection of consumers' interests.
I should like to make a further remark to my good friend Liam Hyland on this matter.
The whole issue of labelling and of how labelling and consumer protection are interrelated has been something that Mr Hyland has been very active in for years.
His question anticipates something that the Commission is about to do. His thinking has been in advance in this area for such a long time.
In his question he identified an area that will require attention from the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
Â Â  I want to thank the President-in-Office for his comprehensive reply and also for his support for the principle of regional advisory committees.
I believe strongly that this new measure, which is included in the common fisheries policy for the first time, will be to the overall advantage of the fisheries sector in the years to come.
Does Minister Roche foresee, if it is successful, that this would become a more involved part of the common fisheries policy and would lead to fishermen and stakeholders having a statutory role in the development of the CFP in the future?
Â Â  . The Council has nothing to add to the answers which were given at the September 2003 part-session, nor to those given to similar questions â Numbers H-0629/03 and H-0743/03 â at the November and December part-sessions.
Â Â  â Thank you MrÂ President.
I should make it clear to the House that we will go on asking questions until the underlying problem and suffering cease to be an issue. We shall certainly continue to press for answers until we receive something better than mere bureaucratic responses.
I would go so far as to say that the latter are unworthy of the person providing them.
The five prisoners in question received extraordinarily heavy sentences following trials deemed by USÂ witnesses and legal experts to lack all legal validity. These trials were condemned as show trials.
Further, human rights are being violated twice over.
Not only are the prisoners being denied their rights, their families are too. The latter are being denied the fundamental right to visit their relatives.
I would like to ask whether the Council is concerned about the human rights of these particular Cubans or whether it is only concerned about the human rights of those other Cubans who have been so much in the limelight over the last few months.
Can a selective approach to human rights in Cuba really be justified?
Should the approach really vary, depending on the identity of the violator of human rights and the identity of the victim of violation?
Is the President-in-Office of the Council aware that the credibility and the authority of the EuropeanÂ Union depend on it acting consistently?
In this case, the Unionâs approach has been entirely inconsistent.
Nonetheless, all this could appear to be of minor importance in the broader context of the whole outrageous situation in Guantanamo Bay.
Â Â  .
Again, I stand by the answers that I have already given on this issue. I would hate to think that anything I have said could be interpreted as indicating any partial approach to any human rights issue anywhere.
Human rights is a universal concern and I would not like it to be thought that the Irish presidency, or indeed any other presidency of the European Union, would adopt a partial approach to issues relating to human rights.
We have to be consistent, and, as I have already said, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations provides the framework in the light of which any issues arising should first be addressed.
Â Â  . I certainly reject the suggestion that the European Union, and certainly this presidency, is in any way equivocal on matters relating to human rights.
As I have already said, the Council and the European Union deplore any situation where human rights are not upheld, but again, as I have already said, if the Cuban Government is concerned about the welfare of any of its citizens in the US, it is free to raise the matter directly with the US authorities, as provided for by the Vienna Convention on consular relations.
That is the issue.
That is where this matter lies. There is a right to raise the matter there.
Whether Members are satisfied or not with that answer, it happens to be the position in international law. It is established by the Convention and I can go no further.
Â Â  . Mr President, the European Commission has proposed extending the remit of the Agency so that it can support the existing Community framework and mechanism in the areas of involuntary or voluntary pollution of the sea and the policy of protection.
We had a long debate on the breadth of this extension in our committee and with senior Commission officials and we arrived almost unanimously at the base line which the Council too can accept.
The basic element of the proposed amendment is that the Agency generally operates in an auxiliary capacity, without contesting the jurisdiction of the Member States, and provides assistance to the European Commission.
I will not hide from you that there was acute concern about transferring tasks, not just safety but also security, and we finally decided to accept the possible.
Perhaps it helped that, in the rapporteur's language, the Greek language, safety and security are translated by the same word.
We believe that, when we talk about a protection mechanism, it is obviously preferable to have a perhaps less equipped mechanism but as quickly as possible. At the moment, what is paramount for us, what must be paramount, is the organisation as quickly as possible of the combating of incidents such as that involving the , for which the European Parliament set up a temporary committee, so that we learn exactly what happened and we have proposals about what to do in future.
In addition, provision is made for an evaluation of the amended regulation so that, if necessary, the procedure to improve it can progress. I should like to take this opportunity to call once again for a stop to the unacceptable treatment of the master of the , Apostolos Magouras, who is being treated as a criminal.
Such conduct is not humanely acceptable and discourages qualified young people from entering seafaring professions, with obvious dangers for world shipping and our seas.
To close, I should like to thank all the political and departmental factors involved and to point out that our committee disagreed with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets, considering that it was not right for them to be included in a regulation such as the amended regulation, for both substantive and formal reasons.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is essential that, in order to prevent abuses and to avoid temptation, the tasks devolved to the Community agencies be defined very precisely, even though the number of such agencies is tending to multiply at an alarming rate.
That is the reason why we are giving particular attention to examining the proposal made to us to increase the competences of the Maritime Safety Agency, particularly in two sensitive areas.
Although, with regard to anti-pollution vessels, we have, on the face of it, nothing against a mutualisation of the cost of providing these, it must be clearly reaffirmed, in regard to the management of these vessels, that the responsibility and the initiative when it comes to preventing and combating marine pollution lies primarily with the coastal Member States and that the Commission must only intervene on a complementary basis by scrupulously and sensibly applying the principle of subsidiarity.
It is crucial to avoid a situation in which Community intervention is in danger of compromising the efficiency of systems of command that have proved their worth, as happened, for example, with the coordination of national, Community and extra-Community resources by the Atlantic police port authority at the time when the went down.
As for extending the agencyâs competences into the area of the fight against terrorist threats, any such extension must be clearly defined.
Thus, the European agency obviously does not have authority to intervene regarding the actual principle of inspections, nor to propose possible sanctions. The agencyâs only possible role is that of simply carrying out inspections of ships and port facilities.
We shall have to be particularly vigilant about this issue, which is extremely sensitive in terms of the security of the Member States, in order to prevent confusion from arising and subcontractors from claiming responsibilities that are not theirs.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, let me remind you that the proposal prepared by you â following careful preparation by your officials â initially caused some confusion.
The port authorities and shipping companies shot your proposal down in flames.
In my view, we must also be grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Stockmann and the entire Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
Mr Grosch also worked very hard in the discussions with the industry, and as a result, we have largely assuaged the sectorâs concerns.
I think they were simply misunderstandings.
I am very pleased that, especially with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur â which we on the Committee on Transport jointly support â we can establish and ensure here today that we are not proposing a European type of standardised container â I prefer not to use the term âsupercontainersâ â which could obstruct our global transportation business.
In the export and import industries, we are reliant on the effective, efficient and swift transportation of these loading units on ships without adaptation of currently existing cell guides etc. In my view, as stipulated in our amendments in committee, we must leave the task of working out the detail to the standardisation committees.
As a lawyer, I would be reluctant to embark on the task of developing the fine detail in my role as a Member of this House. It is, however, my belief that the principles we have set out in the proposed amendments will ensure that the new European loading unit does not conflict with existing international norms.
This new loading unit is important, for it enables us to align the industryâs interests in greater stowability of palettes with the interest of the shipping companies and port authorities not to have to change all the loading gear and the entire structure of the container ships.
In this respect, I think we can be quite happy with what we have achieved.
I hope that the industry will adopt what we are hoping for, namely more widespread use of intermodal units.
We are reliant on the industry here.
We simply make proposals and will have to wait and see whether the new standardised container is accepted by the industry. The industryâs task is to protect its own interests.
Finally, I would like to point out that this proposal contains not only a definition of this new loading unit, but also a requirement for more stringent controls and inspections of all loading units, regardless of type.
If loading units are not properly maintained and repaired, they can pose a danger in goods transportation, in port during trans-shipment etc.
We must ensure that serious accidents do not occur, especially in ports and on ships.
In this respect, the Commission is right to propose more frequent and thorough inspections of all loading units.
((1)
Â Â  The next item is a report (A5-0035/2004) by MrÂ Brie, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Afghanistan: challenges and prospects for the future [2003/2121(INI)].
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if you have ever visited Afghanistan or endeavoured to become more deeply informed about it, you will know how appalling and how extensive is the damage that has been done there â materially, culturally, socially and in human terms.
Civil wars, the power struggles of local warlords, the Soviet war of occupation, the Taliban dictatorship, and the Northern Allianceâs bombardments too have killed and maimed millions, destroyed the economy of what was already an extremely poor country and left much of its society in ruins.
For centuries, Afghanistan was the plaything of foreign powersâ strategic interests.
In my view, the present situation is above all the consequence of the wars sparked off by the Soviet invasion, and of the USAâs short-sighted policies, both of which gave the Taliban real military and political power in Afghanistan.
The victims have always been Afghan women, children and men â in their millions.
This report, however, is not meant to be about our differences on the past â although we certainly have them â but about our common position that the international community must take responsibility for providing, on a massive scale, political, financial and economic support for the people of Afghanistan in shaping a peaceful, democratic and social future for themselves.
This aid, and the financial support provided by the Commission in particular, must not be cut back; it must be stepped up to take account of the prevailing conditions.
It would be irresponsible of the international community, in the shadow of the war in Iraq and of the tragic difficulties there, to backtrack on its commitment to Afghanistan and weaken its solidarity with its people.
I believe that it is precisely because of the situation in Iraq and the unilateralist approach to it that Afghanistan must be one of the international communityâs successes, on the basis of the UN Charter and with a pivotal role for the UN.
Significant and positive changes have been made since the Taliban were ousted.
This has been principally to the credit of the political forces in Afghanistan itself.
The constitution that has just been adopted is a particularly important indicator of progress, guaranteeing as it does fundamental democratic and human rights, doing justice to all ethnic groups and stressing equal treatment for women and men â the latter being immensely significant not only in view of the overthrown regimeâs brutal oppression of women and girls, but also in view of the fact that the situation remains totally unsatisfactory today, with women and girls still at a massive disadvantage, excluded from participation in many aspects of social life and with dreadful violence against women a fact of day-to-day life, with thousands of incidents.
The international community must, as we do in our report, demand universal human rights, with womenâs rights included among them.
Whilst not adopting an imperial approach to doing this, it must be consistent.
Despite these â and other â advances, the situation in Afghanistan is extremely volatile.
The most pressing problems are the non-existent or minimal security in many regions, the potential for conflict inherent in the unbroken military might of warlords, governors and drug traffickers; the disarmament process has ground to a halt, it is proving difficult to demobilise soldiers from the private armies and reintegrate them into society, the Taliban are regrouping in some parts of the south and south-east of the country and there has been a dramatic increase in opium poppy cultivation and in drug trafficking.
As these problems must not be allowed to prevent the forthcoming presidential elections being conducted successfully, I appeal to all Members of this House, and especially to those belonging to the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, not to support the amendments seeking to delete the description of these problems.
Were we to do that, we would, I believe, be doing the people of Afghanistan no favours, nor would we be doing ourselves any if we want to keep Afghanistan as an international policy priority.
Let me also remind you in this regard that, when we recently honoured the Secretary-General of the UN by awarding him and his organisation the Sakharov Prize, we did so in memory of the UN personnel killed in Iraq; the warning of a worsening security situation given as recently as 15 January by Lakhdar Brahimi, who was at the time the UNâs special envoy in Afghanistan and is now its special envoy in Iraq, must be taken seriously.
I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee, and all the groups.
I believe that we had a common will to make clear how much Afghanistan is a priority.
Many thanks also to the EU Commission, to its staff in Kabul and to Francesc Vendrell, its special representative there.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to apologise to the honourable Member at the outset for missing the first minute of his speech.
But I would like to say how much I agreed with the rest of it, particularly what he said about the continuing priority that we must give to Afghanistan.
I also agree very strongly with what he said about the commitment, the dedication and the courage of some of those who are implementing our programmes in Afghanistan.
I very much welcome this opportunity to discuss Afghanistan in the week before I go there again and in the run-up to the most challenging goal set in the Bonn Agreement of 2001 â the free and fair election of a democratic government in Afghanistan.
There was enormous optimism at Bonn about building a strong and democratic Afghanistan, and delivering a peace dividend to the whole population.
Since then there have been huge strides forward, but there are still formidable challenges ahead of us.
Last year I suggested that Afghanistan was at a critical crossroads and that the international community should redouble its efforts to help President Karzai extend his authority across the country.
It is increasingly clear that this also means stamping out opium poppy production.
The 2003 UN opium poppy survey makes extremely disturbing reading: not only has production risen by 6% from the bumper levels seen in 2002, but cultivation has spread into new areas â it now affects almost 90% of provinces.
This pernicious trade â valued at about EUR 2.5 billion â undermines the efforts to build a functioning plural democratic state and also fuels ongoing instability and conflict.
But before discussing how the international community is working with the Afghan Government to tackle this, I would like to highlight what Afghanistan has achieved in the last twelve months.
Firstly, a new constitution â which recognises women as equal to men â has been agreed by the Constitutional Loya Jirga.
Next, the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration has started, and there have been some encouraging early results on the reduction of heavy arms in Kabul and the Panshir valley.
There has also been a start to the election registration process, though we need to speed up the pace.
On the economic front, GDP growth raced ahead by 30% in 2002, with a figure of 20% expected in 2003.
The new currency introduced in late 2002 has remained stable and the Afghan Government has succeeded in increasing the flow of tax revenues to Kabul.
The international community has also continued 'to do more' than we promised at Tokyo.
Total European Union commitments in 2003 exceeded EUR 835 million, of which just over EUR 300 million came from the Commission.
As in 2002, over 70% of the Commissionâs support has been contracted in year, which is an impressive track record by any standards.
The Commissionâs development programme has ensured that health services are delivered in six provinces, covering 20% of the population; travel times on the Kabul-Jalalabad road have already been cut by up to half, and work to fully reconstruct the road is now beginning.
Key public sector workers â including doctors, teachers and the police â are back at work.
The rural economy continues to grow, reflecting the provision of improved seed, animal vaccination and the widespread rehabilitation of irrigation structures.
De-mining continues to enable people to return to their own homes.
In addition, funding from ECHO of EUR 127Â million has helped to support the return of 2.5 million refugees to Afghanistan since 2002.
However, Afghanistanâs future depends critically on security.
The escalating violence in 2003 has, as the honourable Member said, claimed the lives of aid workers, ISAF troops and many Afghan citizens.
It has left large parts of the south and south-east off limits for international staff.
By the end of 2003, EUR 13 million of Commission projects in high-risk areas had been temporarily suspended.
We must recognise that insecurity and burgeoning opium poppy production are two sides of the same coin.
Without better security, reconstruction will certainly stall, and we will find ourselves struggling to hold open and credible elections.
So I strongly welcome Member States' engagement in the Provincial Reconstruction Teams, as well as their continued support to ISAF.
I strongly hope that NATO will be able to provide more troops.
I also welcome the role that France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom are playing in helping the Afghan Government to build an efficient army, police force, and judicial system, as well as to implement an effective anti-narcotics policy.
Without stronger institutions and better law enforcement, we will get nowhere in the fight against drugs.
This is exactly why the Commission committed an extra EUR 50 million to support the police in late 2003, and why we will continue to play our part in delivering security, including tackling opium production.
As I am sure the House is aware, in May 2003 the Afghan Government adopted a robust anti-narcotics policy embracing alternative livelihoods, institution building, effective law enforcement and demand reduction.
The Commission has worked closely with the Afghan Government, the UK â the lead donor on anti-narcotics â and the UN to help develop and implement this strategy.
In particular, in 2003 the Commission committed EUR 9 million to promote alternative livelihoods in the Eastern region; EUR 3 million to reinforce border control along the Afghan-Iran border; and EUR 65.5 million to support the police in delivering effective law enforcement across Afghanistan.
In addition, the wider EUR 100 million committed for rural development for 2003-2004 will help to provide long-term legitimate employment for those currently involved in poppy production.
This underlines the huge importance we attach to curbing the drug economy.
I have asked Commission services to report back on how this will be taken forward following the Drugs Conference a few days ago on 8 and 9 February.
I hope to have substantive discussions on this when I return to Kabul with the Ministerial Troika next week.
Building a secure Afghanistan will not be achieved overnight.
We all know that the road ahead is far from easy.
But we cannot afford to let reconstruction fail in Afghanistan and it is critical that the international community underlines its strong and continued support for President Karzai at the upcoming International Conference.
I would like to finish by thanking this House for its unwavering commitment to Afghanistan, especially as regards the budget.
I look forward to building on this over the coming year and to informing the House, in due course, of the conclusions I arrive at after my next visit to Afghanistan.
Â Â  . â Madam President, as we all know, Afghanistan is a country with more problems than it has mountains and valleys.
It is home to over 30 different ethnic groups, among them Pashtoons, Hasara and Tajiks, who co-exist in an equilibrium that has developed over history, but is very unstable.
It is thus clear to us all that Afghanistanâs problems can be resolved only if proposed solutions and aid programmes are in harmony with Afghan culture and history.
As the rapporteur said, the situation of women in Afghanistan is particularly tragic.
The rate of maternal mortality is among the highest in the world; that is also the case for deaths of infants and children.
According to official estimates the incidence of illiteracy among Afghan women stands at 90%.
I believe that the position of women can be improved only if we involve the men.
Women cannot be helped without persuading their husbands, fathers, brothers and their clan chiefs as well.
If we want to help Afghan women, we have to respect their culture, and, in a country in which women have endured years of oppression, it is the men to whom it has to be explained that, if things are good for their wives and children, then they will be all right too and so society as a whole is better off.
As has been said, women and men must be accorded the same rights.
It is also important that we should build schools for girls â and for boys too â so that there can be some changes in the way they think.
Reference has been made to the Afghan constitution, which accords equal rights to women and men, and which prohibits discrimination of any kind.
As it gets involved, the European Union should continue to respect all this and allow its aid measures to benefit the population as a whole.
I wish to thank the rapporteur for his good cooperation on this issue and am behind both him and the Commission in their conviction that Afghanistan must continue to be a priority on our political agenda if the people who live there are to be helped.
Â Â  â Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Brie for his report, which has given us a fair picture of the situation in Afghanistan, one also very similar to that which we saw together on the ground when we visited last June, under the clear guidance of Mr Morillon.
Since 2001 and following the fall of the Taliban, Afghanistan, with the aid of the European Union and with international assistance, has had to face numerous challenges in order to ensure, on the one hand, its physical reconstruction and, on the other, its political reconstruction.
I am clearly delighted with the adoption of a new Constitution for Afghanistan, on 4 January, by the Loya Jirga.
This new Constitution marks a step forward on the road to democracy, as well as being a fundamental condition for the organisation of the future presidential and legislative elections.
In order for the reconstruction to become a reality, however, and for the political process to be a success, a secure environment is necessary, so that the governmental bodies, the agents of international assistance and civil society can combine their efforts to reconstruct the country's infrastructures and civil institutions.
There will be no reconstruction without security.
That is why we must support the establishment of future provincial reconstruction teams, PRTs, which should soon be deployed outside Kabul.
These teams will have the task of ensuring security, but also helping in the reconstruction of the country.
Our support must extend to the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of former combatants into civilian life.
Finally, we must support the Afghan Government in its fight against opium growing, with a view to helping it to find effective alternative solutions.
We must be aware that opium production has increased by 6% since 2002, which means that the country is the world's biggest supplier with 77% of world production.
Furthermore, the European Union and the international community must continue to actively support the numerous NGOs which, despite the climate of insecurity, provide considerable assistance to the Afghan population.
Within this humanitarian framework, we must encourage implementation of prevention centres and help centres for women, expectant mothers and children.
In fact, even though we must take pleasure in the reference to equal treatment in the new Constitution, we all know that the situation of women is fragile and that respect for their fundamental rights will only be achieved with the help of the international community and as a result of intensive information and education campaigns.
Afghanistan needs financial aid and logistical support from the European Union now more than ever.
The democratic process has begun, but it remains fragile.
It is important that the Commission quickly mobilises the necessary resources to ensure effective financial aid.
That is why I believe that the creation of the European agency for reconstruction in Afghanistan, similar to the one implemented in Kosovo, should receive our full support.
In summary, I would like to remind you that we owe a debt to Afghanistan.
For many years we have been absent when that country needed us.
It is now our responsibility to do everything to help Afghanistan finally live in peace.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Iraq, the occupation of Afghanistan rests on a solid legal basis.
The United Nations Security Council agreed to the military action aimed at eliminating the terrorist bases where the attacks against the United States in Kenya, in Yemen, in New York and in Washington had been promoted.
Also unlike secular Iraq, the Afghanistan of the Taliban had taken the form of a retrograde clerical State in which one of the worst forms of repression consisted of reducing women to the status of nonentity.
Despite these clear differences, there are certain similarities between the economic and political reconstructions of Iraq and of Afghanistan.
As in Iraq, in Afghanistan there is also increasing insecurity, which obliges civilian and military personnel, both indigenous and foreign, to dedicate much of their efforts to their own protection.
Afghanistan and Iraq are both countries with a tribal structure where local bosses and ethnic and religious leaders only want to take the biggest slice of the national cake.
In the past, national unity was only guaranteed by means of a dictatorship, and foreigners or occupying forces are not considered as allies unless they serve the interests of a certain clan chief.
But as time passes, their presence is becoming more and more embarrassing, and at any time irritation may turn to hate, with a war of liberation just around the corner.
The Brie report on Afghanistan brings us face to face with this reality by reminding us of certain essential truths, including the need to speed up the pace of reform and reconstruction.
It rightly criticises the ambiguities of the new Constitution adopted by the tribal grand council, particularly with regard to the restriction of freedom of expression and the situation of women.
When in 2004 we still see the shadows of women imprisoned in their burkas wandering amongst the ruins and the misery, the advantages over the previous regime are not at all obvious.
The challenge of nation building is far from being won.
Nevertheless, like our rapporteur I believe that, for the moment, the United Nations, the European Union and NATO have no choice but to continue their efforts to apply great courage to constructing a democratic Afghanistan which respects the rights of men and women.
It is essential to establish decentralised institutions and the withdrawal of foreign troops.
It is then up to Afghanistan to take control of its own destiny.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his magnificent report on Afghanistan, a country which was in the headlines in autumn 2001.
The Taliban regime was destroyed at that time, but that involved a genuine civil war and consequently exiles, displaced persons and a series of destructions of the countryâs structures.
What is the situation today?
Afghanistan is a country that needs not just political and social reconstruction but also economic reconstruction.
I would like to mention the report which the European Union's special representative in Afghanistan, Francesc Vendrell, presented to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy around a year ago.
He had the experience of having been a United Nations delegate to Afghanistan and he described to us the lack of security in the majority of the territory.
Today Afghanistan has an extremely serious problem with the drugs trade.
The trade is estimated, as Commissioner Patten has said, to stand at USDÂ 2.5Â million per year, which is equivalent to approximately half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.
We hear about 70Â 000 to 80Â 000 hectares of cultivation by the bosses who control the territory, cultivation which is not restricted to raw production, since there are also ârefiningâ plants so that the drug can be exported directly.
According to the report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), two-thirds of the worldâs heroin is produced in Afghanistan.
This naturally creates serious problems in the country and, in this regard, I hope the support of the European Union and the international community can continue with a view to eradicating consumption as well, which, as the Commissioner has said, is the other face of the existing insecurity.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank our rapporteur for the very complete nature of his report.
It contains absolutely everything we may wish to find, and so it is a pleasure to read and support it.
I would like to take this opportunity to stress that we have made women the emblem of the oppression of the Afghan people.
We have made women the emblem of the fight against the Taliban.
Will we make women the emblem of the reconstruction of Afghanistan?
That is not certain and therefore â as was said on comparing the situation in Afghanistan with that in Iraq just now â at times of war or liberation, in certain countries, the issue of women arises and becomes particularly acute.
In this regard, the situation of Iraqi women is alarming.
So why do we not focus on the issue of women today in Afghanistan?
Commissioner, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has had an exchange of letters with you in relation to the attention paid to the issue of women within the framework of reconstruction and in relation to the proportion of aid earmarked by the European Union for this issue.
We wanted 20%.
I realise that this is enormous and that the figure is perhaps rather arbitrary.
In fact, it appears that 2% is allocated to this chapter.
Mainstreaming, above all in the field of health, certainly plays its role to the full, and so we are not going to talk about figures.
Having said that, what really amazes me, as well as the scant importance attached to the issue of women, is above all the absence of an education dossier in the Commission's work and in the budget lines proposed.
Everybody knows that the issue of education, and in particular the education of girls, is essential within the context of women as an emblem of reconstruction.
That was the first comment I wanted to make.
The second is that we are certainly very happy with the mention of the principle of equality between men and women in the Constitution.
We ourselves are fighting, in this House, for this principle to be present in the European Constitution.
It follows that this issue does not only arise over in Afghanistan, but here as well.
We are very well aware, here, that a principle is not sufficient, that it needs to be applied.
We are happy with what has just happened in Morocco in relation to women's rights, but we are waiting for it to be applied.
The same is clearly true for Afghanistan as it is for us.
Â Â  Madam President, the excellent report by MrÂ Brie needs little comment.
In my opinion, it gives a good account of the problems with the new constitution.
It makes it clear that there are good reasons for possibly delaying the elections by a few months, and emphasises once again the need to further improve the situation of women.
The tragedy is, however, that, with this report in our hands and the Commissionâs good intentions, we have sadly found ourselves in a position where we may well be full of good intentions and have excellent plans, but neither the European Parliament nor even the European Commission has any influence on the circumstances under which those plans have to be carried out, namely the lack of security.
There is a growing number of reports from NGOs stating that twelve aid workers were killed last year, for example.
A growing number of reports from NGOs reveal that there is a very large number of good projects that they are unable to carry out.
The Commissioner, too, referred to EUR 30Â million of projects that, sadly, cannot be carried out owing to the lack of security.
This week, we have once more seen the newspapers full of splendid plans for rapid reaction forces.
That is great when it comes to preventing bloodshed in Africa, but it must not be at the expense of less sexy projects, so to speak, such as the difficult development work in Afghanistan.
After all, the Member States of the European Union now have a good deal to say for themselves in the way of promises, magnificent things that should be done, but soldiers are not going there, they are going there far too little, and that is the key problem.
I believe that there are hardly any fellow Members from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats still here, but I should like to call them to account on a mistake they made in December, in my view.
They convinced Parliament that we should cut the aid to Afghanistan â yes, you heard right â because drug trafficking is not being tackled.
The fact that drug trafficking is not being tackled is a direct consequence of the omission on the part of EU Member States to send any troops to Afghanistan, which contributes to dependence on warlords for the maintenance of order by such troops as are there, and consequently makes those troops reluctant to tackle opium trafficking.
We must avoid a situation where we fail to keep our promises again, where Afghanistan sinks into an opium economy, led by warlords, and â my greatest concern â where the hopes of many Afghans, particularly Afghan women, are dashed once again.
We must not allow this to happen.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, very recently, a thought-provoking analysis of the political situation in Afghanistan appeared in the with the headline: âAfghanistan: The Gulf between Report and Realityâ.
In it, the author, a widely travelled veteran Afghanistan journalist, turns the common Western image of Kabul and its environs on its head.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you can be assured that the present report has prompted me to reflect on this a good deal.
I should like to summarise the article for you, therefore, and add a question about our strategy in Afghanistan.
I also hope to give the article to the Commissioner later on, and that he has time to peruse it.
This journalist, John Jennings, disproves the spectre of the Afghan countryside as an Oriental Wild West on the basis of his own observations.
With a few localised exceptions, he sees a safe, peaceful society; in short, no local warlords constantly making life unbearable for each other and the population.
On the contrary, he sees encouraging signs of reconstruction, and also the return of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran.
In the opinion of Jennings, that huge majority of ordinary Afghans living in areas not actively contested by Taliban remnants have it better today than at any time since 1978.
Interim President Karzai should have every interest in this.
To look at the scenario Jennings describes, however, the reverse seems to be true: with the help of ISAF and NATO, the technocrats in Kabul are seeking the military and political removal of the anti-Taliban groups in the provinces.
It is precisely that Pashtoon agenda that gives rise to the very real danger of a general revolt against a regime imposed from outside: an Afghan tradition.
In Jenningsâs view, it would be much more beneficial to the future of Afghanistan as a nation state to construct carefully and gradually from the bottom up, and to achieve political consensus among the regional authorities, which do, after all, sanction a weak central authority.
Interfering with this fragile process would give the Taliban and their anti-Western Pakistani patrons a second chance.
This would mean an out-and-out defeat for the West in the fight against Islamic terrorism.
ParagraphsÂ 12 andÂ 13 of this report reveal that my colleague MrÂ Brie recognises the acute problem, this area of tension.
Unfortunately, he does not enter into a more in-depth exploration of this fundamental problem regarding Afghanistanâs future as a nation: this issue is subordinated.
We shall have to make do with that.
What are the views of the Council and the Commission in this regard?
I should like to bring this article to the attention of CommissionerÂ Patten, particularly given his plans to set off for Kabul in the near future.
I shall hand it to you later on.
After all, no small matter is involved: a fair, sensible international strategy towards a breeding ground for international terrorist networks.
Â Â  â Madam President, one reason why Afghanistan is a topic of crucial importance is the need to demonstrate that not only can terrorism with State links be defeated, but that peace can then be won too.
Things are not looking too good in Afghanistan at the moment.
It is rumoured that Taliban groups in the south are making mighty advances, one hears â as the Russian defence minister, Mr Ivanov, said in Munich last week â that the cultivation of drugs has increased nine times over since the war began, and we see how soldiers from Europe, who are supposed to be working for the countryâs future security, are unable to take action against it.
It appears that they were watching over the drug routes along which the drugs find their way to Europe and to our children.
To my mind, this is a very problematic situation and is the reason why it is urgently necessary that we should make every effort to facilitate the establishment of the rule of law and of democracy under a strong and guaranteed central power that also takes account of ethnic differences and of diversity.
There will be no peace in Afghanistan for as long as â as has been the case â the provision of aid and the division of power are one-sided, with the Pashtoons losing out.
This, I believe, is something else that we have to stress.
The elections need to be properly prepared, so that it is clear who is entitled to vote and so that the elections may gain legitimacy, and the new constitution needs to be used in order for this balance of power to be achieved.
The new constitution brings with it both opportunities and problems, for it makes Sharia law possible.
While the courts still have judges as conservative as the present ones, nothing that comes out of them will be acceptable to us in terms of our view of what the rule of law means.
This, I believe, is why we must, over the coming weeks and months, devote much attention and a great deal of effort to looking after this country.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group I would like to thank Mr Brie for the wonderful work he has done, providing us with a clear and accurate picture of the reconstruction work that Afghanistan has to undertake and the challenges it must face in the coming years.
Above all, though, I would like to thank him for the particular attention he has paid to respect for womenâs rights, for the vigilance he has asked us to show because of the fragility of what has been gained.
A great deal of progress has indeed been made, at least in the constitutional text: political power exercised by constitutional representatives, representation of women, equality between men and women written in black and white, respect for linguistic diversity considered as an asset and not as a threat and, finally, respect for the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Even if an Islamic state is declared, I believe it would be remarkable for that part of the world.
This challenge is, however, a shared one, faced by both the international community and the European Union.
We must respect our own commitments to ensure this democratic transition and it is essential that we are clearly present in order to support all the processes to put in place the necessary structures for civil and economic reform in Afghanistan.
In fact, the climate of insecurity must not destabilise the efforts made, and hence the unquestionable need for a multiannual framework programme which would allow both the structuring of the judicial system and the establishment of specific reconciliation regulations as well as an education system.
It also seems to me to be essential that the whole process of pacification should go hand-in-hand with the process of economic and social reconstruction.
Having said that, we are wary of the slow pace of this reconstruction, since it could jeopardise the stability necessary for the development of the country.
We have made many commitments, we must fulfil them quickly and, above all, understand that the least delay on our part risks being exploited by others to establish their hold on fragile structures, with the help of funds originating from drug trafficking.
We must also work on making the progress made in favour of the population visible so that the people do not sink into despair after 25 years of war.
If we fail to meet this challenge, we could lose not only our credibility, but also an area of peace on which stability in the region depends.
Â Â  Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur for a very fine report, which I know we will all support.
I should also like to thank the Commissioner and his team for their fine work in the field.
I remind colleagues that in October 2001 the oppression of Afghan women was highlighted globally.
The assumption was made that the removal of the Taliban regime would ease the women's plight.
Today, two and a half years on, Amnesty claims that the international community and the Afghan administration have been unable to protect the rights of women.
Rape and sexual violence by members of the occupying armed forces are still widespread.
In the western province of Herat, Taliban-like decrees are still widespread and, as a result of this oppression, more women in Afghanistan are committing suicide now than they were under the Taliban regime.
Human Rights Watch reports many sexual assaults against children.
Despite the rhetoric, the creation of the Women's Ministry, the Karzai Government pursues anti-women policies, and there is no legal protection, while older legal systems still in position prohibit them from getting help.
Women's resistance to the regime still has to work underground.
The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan is forbidden to open an office and distribute its magazine.
People caught reading its literature are still in physical danger.
Commissioner Patten said that Afghanistan had reached a crossroads.
I believe, as do Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, that the government has taken a wrong turn and that the position of women is worse than it was before.
Â Â  Madam President, the situation today is the result of continual intervention of one form or another by the Americans and their allies over recent years, both to overturn the popular democratic regime in Afghanistan and impose their mercenary Taliban and to directly invade and occupy Afghanistan militarily on the pretext of fighting terrorism.
Unfortunately, in the proposed motion, all this is passed over in silence.
Not a word is said about the criminal responsibility of the Americans and, in essence, support is given to the foreign-born Karzai government, the credentials of which, as we know, are non-existent.
The report accepts these interventions and tries to propose solutions without disputing the present situation.
It considers the transfer of the responsibility of the occupying forces to NATO to be positive and proposes new funding which will strengthen its position in the controlled areas, while there is no guarantee whatsoever for the management of these funds for the benefit of the Afghan people, especially women.
It welcomes the new constitution approved by the Loya Jirga, while at the same time highlighting its negative aspects, which make it unacceptable.
It nurtures futile hopes of democratic elections, while recognising that the conditions for them are not in place.
At the same time, while finding that today the main source of income is from the cultivation of opium, the primary revenue from which goes to local warlords, it does not concern itself at all with its further movements in the world and the involvement of the CIA in it.
That is why, although we congratulate and thank the rapporteur, AndrÃ© Brie, on the huge effort he has made, we unfortunately cannot support his report, because it is clear from the foregoing that the report does not face the facts.
The Afghan people, victims of the new order, will be able to find their way if they resist the forces propelling it, either in the form of religious fanaticism or under the cloak of a poor copy of a western-type bourgeois democracy, the military interventions and the occupation.
We must support them in this fight.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly and most importantly, my thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent report, which gives a good overview of the many problems Afghanistan is still having to face.
Allow me to examine the Commissionerâs communication in greater depth, however.
Commissioner, you have overwhelmed us a little with figures, and I admit that they are impressive.
However, I am wondering about the following.
We have here a country which is in need of reconstruction, which must first and foremost reconstruct itself, and an economic basis is a prerequisite for this.
As you emphasise, the fight against opium cultivation is a very important aspect, but, in all the various measures forming part of the strategy to combat that opium cultivation, I have not actually heard what alternatives the producers have.
I have seen documentaries showing how the military descend upon farming communities and destroy everything for the sake of opium cultivation.
I do understand the necessity of this, but how do we mean for it to stop if people do not have an alternative income?
The same goes for the warlords. How are they ever to stop being warlords if they are constantly being supplied with money from the opium economy?
Finally, I had actually wanted to speak about women, but I cannot because my time is up.
I should like to give one example, however: the construction of a womenâs centre in Kabul on which work had only taken a few months.
It was built, it was inundated with women looking for education and health care, it was a place where they could take off their burkas in peace.
It is possible; why is it, then, that we are so slow to produce results with international resources?
Â Â  Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Brie on his excellent report.
I would now like to address Commissioner Patten: there are two issues that I would like him to raise.
In November 2003, Mr Karzai's Government allowed the enforcement of a 1970 law banning married women from the classroom which, according to the Deputy Education Minister, led to the expulsion of about two to three thousand women.
Could you raise the issue of this law enforcement?
Article 3 of the Afghan Constitution states that: 'No law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of Islam.'
This language â designed to secure a relatively smooth approval of the new Afghan Constitution â may entail high costs for women in the future.
The control of education by religious authorities is definitely a very alarming signal and an issue that should be raised.
Many reports confirm that in several regions of Afghanistan there is no security for women, and education for girls is under threat.
16 attacks have been documented on girls' schools since September 2002, ranging from rocket attacks to setting schools on fire or their forced closure by gunmen.
Their effect is devastating.
According to the UN Development Programme, the gross enrolment ratio at primary level has been most recently calculated as being 39% for boys, with a corresponding rate for girls of just 3%.
The UNICEF programme 'Back to School', launched in March 2002, gave rise to great expectations.
More than three million children â one-third of them girls â flooded the classrooms in Afghanistan.
However, in Kandahar, leaflets were distributed with the message 'Stop sending your women to offices and daughters to school.
It spreads indecency and vulgarity.
Stand ready for the consequences if you do not heed the advice.'
Then, after five months, these violent attacks on girls' schools began.
We know the immense challenges that confront the Afghan Transitional Authority today.
The European Union and the international community should strongly support economic, social and political reconstruction.
However, it is imperative that security for women throughout the country is a priority for both donors and the Afghan Government.
If we fail in that, the future will be very grim.
Â Â  Madam President, sadly Afghanistan has been slightly forgotten about in the aftermath of the Iraq war.
A lot of resources will be needed to rebuild the country, and the EU is a large donor; in my view this entitles us to lay down significant political conditions, including demanding progress in human rights, particularly women's rights to education and access to the workforce.
I also regret the new Constitution, which gives primacy to Sharia law over international, UN, civil, and political treaty obligations: this may cause conflict over areas such as female lapidation.
I am concerned at the lack of security and the necessary concentration of ISA forces in Kabul to protect the government.
There have been significant regroupings of Taliban and al-Qa'ida forces bent on murdering international aid workers in the provinces, which will set back progress.
I do not believe President Musharraf is doing enough to rein in terrorist groups in Pakistan's tribal areas and north-west frontier provinces; this is ostensibly because Islamabad's writ does not run to these parts.
More must be done if he is to have credibility in the fight against international terrorism.
I was delighted that the Bactrian gold treasures were recovered and I would like to see funds devoted to the reconstitution of the National Museum in Kabul as a symbol of national pride under the patronage of the royal family, which is a benign uniting force in the land.
Lastly, on the subject of the opium crop, my amendment has suggested consideration being given to buying and burning or using it for medical purposes as a painkiller, as a cheaper alternative to drug enforcement measures by the international organisations dedicated to fighting the drug trade and business.
It would save the international community a lot of money to burn it and pay the farmers, instead of spending many billions of dollars fighting the drug trafficking trade.
Â Â  Madam President, the situation in Afghanistan is of great interest to this House.
This important report, in the context of the development of democracy in Afghanistan, is highly topical.
As the report emphasises, the situation since the end of the Taliban regime has improved, but additional efforts need to be made.
For example, as many have said this morning, the situation of women must be highlighted.
Literacy is still unbelievably low, with only a 10% to 15% literacy rate among women.
Only one-third of school children are girls.
They are often held back from returning to school.
And even if some of these women go to school they face violence just for attending.
These trends are strongest outside Kabul, in the south and east of the country, where the situation of women is not so well known but is much worse than in the political centre.
The Constitution, drawn up in January, specifically recognises the equality between men and women.
25% of the seats in the House of the People are reserved for women, yet it remains uncertain that this provision, along with others establishing rights for women, will help to implement women's rights properly or help women get elected in the coming election.
Many Members have talked about the issue of drugs.
We live in a world where a poppy grown in Afghanistan can end up being illegally sold as heroin in Scotland.
The human suffering caused by the drugs problem and its links to crime in our communities concerns us all.
That is why we should support the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy, which sets the target of complete elimination of poppy growing by 2013.
I am pleased that the UK Government plans to deploy an enhanced drugs team to Kabul and Kandahar by the end of the year and has made GBP 70Â million available, over three years, for law enforcement, capacity-building, alternative livelihoods for those who are involved in poppy cultivation, and demand-reduction initiatives.
We must ensure that capacity for effective public administration continues to improve at central and provincial levels.
Â Â  Madam President, the ISAF troops and many other aid organisations are doing a lot of good in Afghanistan.
Their work is, however, being sabotaged by the presence of the American forces.
Last year, I had the opportunity, together with an EU delegation, to visit the US headquarters in Baghram.
It was clear that the Americans have no plans whatsoever regarding womenâs rights, democracy or the fight against drugs.
By their own admission, what interests them is that each government in Afghanistan should acknowledge the US troopsâ right to return, if they ever leave the country.
That is quite revealing in terms of what is at issue here.
When we were in Baghram, there was something we did not get to see and about which an American journalist told us, namely the prison in Baghram, in comparison with which reports from GuantÃ¡namo Bay seem like accounts of a Sunday school picnic.
She had learned that, at that time in any case, there were several hundred prisoners in the jail at Baghram, exposed to torture.
They were not being hit, but they were forced to stand naked for hours, day in and day out, under constant questioning.
Finally, two prisoners died, and the journalist got an honest American doctor to state clearly in the death certificate that the cause of death was murder.
It nonetheless took several months before the New York Times dared to publish the relevant article.
That is how sensitive it is to acknowledge that in Afghanistan, just as in many other places, the American soldiers are gangsters who use every means available to defend American interests but who are completely indifferent to the local population.
Let us remove the Americans and replace them with reasonable people from the ISAF and aid organisations.
There are so many others who can make constructive efforts.
The Americans are merely making a bad situation worse.
Â Â  â Madam President, the report on Afghanistan is to be welcomed in so far as it demonstrates that land of the Hindu Kush, having become a focus of international attention in the aftermath of 11 September 2001, will not again be forgotten, and that the European Union is maintaining its financial and political commitment in order to help achieve stability.
The essential picture painted by the report is a very pessimistic one, which, in my view, takes too little account of the positive elements, one of which was, without a doubt, the Loya Jirgaâs adoption of the constitution last December.
The constitution is primarily intended to strengthen central government, without which this country, divided between ethnic groups and torn asunder by decades of warfare and Soviet occupation, has scarcely any chance of building itself into a nation or of normal development.
The next thing needed is democratic elections, which will, in this country, be a difficult process.
Even though the preparatory work has got underway too late, the elections should be held as soon as possible, on the presupposition that they will reinforce the stabilisation process.
I am aware that the Americans are insisting on the elections being held in June, but, if the situation is to be kept calm, and the conditions for a more or less democratic election created, it is not absolutely necessary to stick to this date.
We said in August that it would be no disaster if they were to be held rather later.
All the other measures intended to help pacify the country can be compared with the proverbial glass of water, which is either half full or half empty.
The security situation is as dire as it was before.
The militant Taliban have apparently re-established themselves in the south-east, and the Americans are not excluding the possibility of using land troops in a spring offensive.
Although the extension of the ISAFâs operations to the areas outside Kabul is to be welcomed, its mandate is so limited that German troops stationed in Kundus â the safest area, incidentally â are in fact simply onlookers while opium smuggling continues to be one of the countryâs main sources of revenue, which, in its turn, has made Afghanistan the worldâs largest producer of opium.
The opium trade is in full swing, still helping to maintain the warlords and their armies, and that is one of the main problems.
Â Â  Mr President, first, may I apologise to the House for missing much of this debate, but unfortunately I had to be present at the STOA Panel to vote to try and prevent the suppression of a scientific report at the behest of Europe's chocolate multinationals on inedibles in food.
Doubly unfortunately, the vote was lost by 11 votes to 8.
On Afghanistan, firstly I congratulate Mr Brie on his report on a difficult subject in a difficult country.
I was privileged to be part of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to Afghanistan in June 2003.
It was clear that security is the paramount issue.
Unfortunately, the glass increasingly seems to be half-empty, rather than half-full.
The occupying coalition troops and the United States sit out their days in their fixed and mobile fortresses, when on the streets they exhibit the same heavy-handed style currently displayed in Iraq.
ISAF has a footprint centred on Kabul, limiting its operations to 2% of Afghanistan's land area.
The rest of the country is effectively abandoned to feuding warlords who monopolise revenues and dispense arbitrary justice in their private prisons, making President Karzai at times little more than the United States-backed mayor of Kabul.
After the marines killed three Afghan national army soldiers in a friendly-fire exchange, ISAF stepped in to broker peace between the two groups, ostensibly on the same side.
Yet for many in the Afghan national army, the ISAF and the United States troops are merely all flowers from the same garden.
Campaigns without resources to spread ISAF's presence outside Kabul are wishful and wistful thinking.
No-one seems able or willing to find the money to increase the number of troops â some 40Â 000 would be needed for nationwide coverage.
In the south the main targets for the remnants of the Taliban are foreigners, but without reconstruction work, the temptation for the local population is to see the situation as no better, if not worse, than under the Taliban.
Many people argue that large sections of the Taliban could be brought back into civic society, but to do that would be to shift the social centre of gravity back towards an Islamic conservatism that bodes ill for women's emancipation.
Human rights is important, particularly the situation of women.
Formal rights may well be given but they are unlikely to play out in the villages.
The best hope for the future may be universal education, which will not change current attitudes but rather those of the next generation.
The United States and the EU are pushing bottom lines that in practice are probably undeliverable.
As the United Nations Special Representative said, if you are trying to introduce western-style democracy in Afghanistan, you are wasting your time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Brie for a very well written and important description of the position in Afghanistan and of what we should do to improve it.
I have four points I wish to make to Parliament and to Commissioner Patten.
The first concerns drugs.
While the international community works to prevent drug abuse, Afghanistanâs illegal opium production discourages individual governments in the surrounding area from contributing financially to the reconstruction of the country.
According to an investigation by the UN body for drugs control and crime prevention, Afghanistan was responsible in 2003 for three quarters or 75% of the worldâs total production of illegal opium.
That is, to say the least, deeply worrying.
The second point concerns the position of women.
The antidemocratic and Islamicist Taliban regime was guilty during its time in power of the most deliberate violation of womenâs rights in modern times.
The regime introduced a gender apartheid that totally denied womenâs identity.
The Taliban regime is now gone but, in very many respects, its view of women still prevails in Afghanistan.
The countryâs authorities, the international community and the EU must therefore make every possible effort to change this view.
The third point concerns freedom of religion.
Afghanistanâs first constitution following the fall of the Taliban dictatorship is cause for concern, given certain wordings about the dominant role of Islamic law, about restrictions upon certain human rights and individual freedoms and about restrictions upon womenâs rights.
The last point concerns the education system.
We in the European Parliament want to see an open education system as an alternative to the madrasas or the Koran schools that operate as strongholds of Muslim extremism and of a culture of hatred in which Taliban militants are recruited.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Brie on an excellent report.
I also had the honour of being on the delegation to Afghanistan.
I know that some people have congratulated me on being a first in a number of things.
Another first that I now count is the fact that I was sitting having tea with some of the biggest drug dealers and drug producers in the world.
I am particularly addressing my remarks to the honourable Member who, I know, is going to disappear into the sunset before too long, but maybe he can make a great contribution to European safety if in his few months remaining he takes on board some of the issues I was talking about.
The total value of the poppy crop at the farm gate in Afghanistan is estimated at EUR 700Â million.
Its heroin street value is estimated at EUR 12.5 billion.
The amount of revenue spent by Member State police forces, customs services and anti-drug squads to control heroin imports and use alone adds up to EUR 4 billion per year.
The number of arrests for drug offences throughout the EU is around 700Â 000 people per year.
60Â 000 people are imprisoned every year for drug offences, leading to annual custodial costs of EUR 1.5Â billion.
We need an alternative development approach for Afghanistan which integrates EU drug policy into its development policy.
We have to offer the rural population economically viable and steady means of earning an income.
Therefore is it not far better to stop this trade at the point of growing, rather than the point of consumption or distribution?
If we do this, we will save EUR 4 billion in policing costs alone, and EUR 1.5 billion in custodial costs.
I propose to the honourable Member that we manage this transition, from poppy growing to fruit growing, as we now do for Greek tobacco, which we buy and burn.
A similar exercise could be done for the poppy crop in Afghanistan, and I would like the honourable Member to take this on board seriously.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement on reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am extremely pleased to have this opportunity to express to Parliament why this communication is so important.
We have designed a coherent strategy maximising the use of all our instruments to promote respect for democracy, the rule of law and human rights in a region that poses formidable challenges in this respect.
The communication proposes to use our essential elements clause much better through our political dialogue with partner countries.
It explains how further to involve civil society.
Crucially, it invites our Mediterranean partners to develop nationally owned human rights strategies.
This is an innovation.
It is not the only one.
Countries which progress well will be rewarded with additional MEDA funds.
This is in addition to the MEDA projects already under way to help reform the judiciary and promote good governance â currently funded to the tune of EUR 100 million.
It is easy simply to dismiss the chance of success of these projects.
Yet, as we all know, the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights and the rule of law rests with governments.
Any strategy that ignores this fact is doomed to failure.
That is also why the Sanaâa conference â which I know the honourable Member attended â was such a breakthrough, and one on which we must build.
I am pleased that the Director-General of my own department, Mr Landaburu, was also able to attend that extremely important and significant conference.
No real progress will be achieved without a freely functioning, vibrant civil society.
This is where the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights comes into play.
EUR 25 million have been allocated to this region for the period 2002-2004.
In addition, a substantial proportion of the extra EUR 17.5 million, which this House voted to the European Initiative at the end of last year, will be used to reinforce support to grass roots organisations working to defend human rights and democratisation in this part of the world.
The communication has already produced encouraging results, in Morocco and Jordan in particular.
It was warmly welcomed by the Council.
Key partners in civil society have also recognised its value.
The full support of the European Parliament will be crucial to the success of this, which is, I repeat, a ground-breaking approach, in one of the most difficult regions of the world with respect to human rights and democracy.
Parliament's resolution also takes up aspects of the management of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and Parliamentâs role in the shaping of the initiative.
In this context, I would like to recall that we have come a very long way since 1994.
That was the budget year in which, for the first time, nine separate budget lines were linked up under one heading.
Five years later in 1999, implementation of these budget lines was put on a firm legal basis with two regulations, one for developing countries and one for âother countriesâ â Wider Europe, MEDA, the Balkans and others.
These basic facts define the objectives of the European Initiative, shape its instruments, and set up the administrative procedures.
The European Parliament was fully involved in the making of these regulations.
I trust that Parliament will support the extension of the Initiative beyond 2004, in line with its current legislative framework.
The Commission has always kept Parliament fully informed of our thinking.
Our communication of May 2001 on the European Unionâs role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, which proposed a more strategic approach for the Initiative, was welcomed and fully supported by the European Parliament.
In the same vein, since 2002, the Commission has kept Parliament informed about the multi-annual programming of the Initiative, and its annual updates, and sought appropriate discussion with Parliament on our priorities.
Members are fully aware of the procedural constraints under which the Commission operates, which are contained in the human rights regulations, the financial regulation, comitology and so on. It is not in the Commissionâs power to change these rules.
But I am fully committed, and my services are ready, to continue the fruitful dialogue we have had so far on all issues concerning human rights and democratisation, including the strategy and objectives of our assistance to third countries.
On this basis, I would call on Parliament to give full support to a speedy extension of the regulations before this Parliament is dissolved in order to have a stable framework in place for the next Parliament and Commission to build upon.
I would just make two additional comments.
The work we are doing in the field of democratisation and human rights in the wider Middle East is crucial not only to the sustainable economic and political development of countries in that region, but also to the relationship between Europe and the Islamic world, particularly those parts of the Islamic world which are closer to our own geographical borders.
This is an area in which we have been working in general terms for some time.
I recently read the statements by a very distinguished American public official about what was required in order to develop a more stable, secure and plural region in the Middle East.
I read those comments with interest and wished I had been able to say immediately to him that they are very good ideas â we call them the Barcelona Process and we have been working on them since the mid-1990s.
We have to recognise that this is not simply a bright idea for a Monday morning to be forgotten by the end of the week.
This is a long-term process and we have to commit ourselves to it, I hope with more vigour and occasional tough-mindedness.
We have to recognise that there must be linkages between financial support and behaviour on the ground.
We also have to recognise that we are working with the grain of societies and with the grain of people's aspirations.
My second point is quite simply that a number of honourable Members in this Chamber speak with very considerable authority on this subject.
I am thinking of the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, of the honourable Member who was once speaking from this bench and also of my honourable friend who will, I hope, catch your eye later in the debate, Mr President.
They have played a key role in developing the European Union's policies on democracy and human rights.
It stands to reason that we should listen very carefully to their views on the institutional arrangements that we need to put in place and on how we can sharpen up our performance and ensure that what we do is better focused and more effective throughout the region.
I just want to underline that, as far as I am concerned, speaking for the Commission, we are open-minded about the ideas that Members of Parliament will put to us and simply want to ensure that what we do is as effective as possible.
Two admirable reports by the UNDP have underlined the significance of this work and I, for one, want to ensure that we in Europe rise to the challenge of those reports and do not simply regard them as containing a few good ideas that can be brought out and dusted down from time to time.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes the Commissionâs statement.
I believe that it is an important step, and can also provide an integrated approach to various policies.
As the Commissioner has said, this is about the integration of the Barcelona process with the âWider Europeâ strategy and the issues related to the funding of MEDA and other programmes.
These, I believe, must also include human rights and democracy, for lasting peace can come into being only if the state, civil society, the political forces and parties guarantee, in the long term, deep roots for democracy and the rule of law, which always provides the greatest certainty of peaceful development.
This is of enormous significance for us, not only because of human rights, which should be guaranteed by other means, but also because stabilising regions like this on the basis of democracy and the rule of law is the best security policy we can pursue in our own interests; we should indeed ensure that stability prevails there in such a way that people have a future and do not fall prey to fundamentalism, as they would otherwise be justified in doing.
This is what underlies many political problems in countries in the Middle East, making it more difficult to lead them towards a better future.
It is specifically in matters such as these, Commissioner, that I see it as important that non-governmental organisations should be brought on board, but please allow me to comment on what you have just said in your conclusion.
It strikes me as important that â as was previously the case in Central and Eastern Europe â such democracy programmes should increasingly draw on the experience of the European Parliament and of its MEPs, not only by consulting them, but also by involving them in the decision-making process.
Whilst I am not defending a breach of the separation of powers, the fact is that we, with our own experience gained from the daily business of building up democracy, parties andgrassroots democracy, have more knowledge than is to be found in an administrative body, in which people are trained to look at things from a completely different angle, and I do not believe that this is about simply coming up with theoretical concepts that cost a lot of money but produce no results.
It is far more about setting up effective structures on the ground.
Perhaps we should revert to this former practice; it would be an interesting area in which to experiment and see what progress this enables us to make.
May I make a final comment?
In the past, I believe, both the Commission and Parliament paid insufficient attention to whether or not our resolutions on human rights and democracy were actually implemented.
In this respect, monitoring and implementation were our weak points.
We came up with some tremendous resolutions, and then that was that.
The possibility of checking whether or not anything is done about them seems to me to be acquiring ever-greater importance; it, too, is tied in with the integrative process of which I spoke at the beginning.
I believe that many agreements should be linked to the establishment of human rights, and that much funding should be linked to the development of democracy, in order thereby to establish checks and balances that make possible the practical application of democracy and human rights, on which stability depends, and saves them from being merely fine-sounding words.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Patten, it is important that the issue of human rights and democracy is once again brought to the centre of the debate on relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries.
Almost ten years on from the Barcelona process we note that there is still a serious lack of democracy in these countries, which has also been pointed out in numerous United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reports.
Indeed, we must ask ourselves if the policy that we have implemented to date and, above all, the instruments put forward in this area, were adequate given the ambitious objectives of the Barcelona strategy.
ArticleÂ 2 of the clause of the bilateral association agreements has turned out to be broadly insufficient.
I am, however, asking a more complex question: are bilateral agreements adequate instruments for promoting the development of human rights?
I believe that these agreements have helped to give international recognition to regimes that would otherwise have had no legitimacy.
We need to be very careful about this, and I believe that the Commission communication poses this question.
I support the ten points; the Initiative for Democracy that the European Parliament wants is an interesting instrument because it is one of the few instruments which allows measures to be carried out independent of governments.
Indeed, all the others fall within the intergovernmental sphere, even if you are right, Commissioner, when you state that we need to remember that part of this dialogue must also involve the ruling classes.
Nevertheless, I would like this instrument to be more consistent with the rest of our policies, otherwise there is a risk that it will be a way to legitimise the other policies, which are essentially .
This incentive is, therefore, excellent, it is good for countries prepared to go down this road and it is just as excellent regarding the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which could have interesting potential.
It is extremely important for the Sanaâa Conference, which has brought the issue to the attention of governments and civil society.
I ask myself, however, if there should not be a permanent and unequivocal push for democracy from the European institutions, which is also based on new instruments.
For example, Commissioner, why not try, with these countries, to have a multilateral convention on human rights, which is also based on institutions that are able to guarantee these rights?
Compared to the current situation, this would give rise to a different dynamic.
Finally, I tabled an amendment to ArticleÂ 11, because I think that farming out this policy to an external agency somewhat contradicts the debate that we have had up until now, since it should be the European institutions that have the power to implement this policy.
Therefore, as regards financial procedures, should the Commission not have instruments that are adapted to implementing these objectives?
Â Â  MrÂ President, democracy and human rights in Mediterranean countries are still in a wretched state, the main cause being that the authorities never relinquish power and do not even want to share it.
Autocratic regimes can only maintain their hold on power by means of repression and by restricting freedom.
The worst hit are the people who are badly governed and lag behind economically and socially.
This forms a breeding ground for radicalism on the part of disaffected people that impacts on not only the region itself, but also the rest of the world.
The European Union must do everything in its power to exert a positive influence on the situation, therefore.
The partnerships provide a good framework for this; one, however, of which we have up to now made insufficient, and insufficiently binding, use.
Financial aid alone, without political conditions, will only lead to a deterioration in the situation, and for that reason I welcome this spur to the reinvigoration of policy wholeheartedly.
The Commission communication, with its ten priorities, is truly excellent.
Many of the proposed actions are in line with the specific suggestions I made in my report on human rights last year.
The intentions and approach are good, but, of course, results are by no means guaranteed.
We are ultimately aiming to induce the regimes to make fundamental changes in their behaviour that they would not have been inclined to make of their own accord.
The new actions must not lead to bureaucratisation, but rather to specific objectives that are tested systematically.
It is very important to give the situation a positive boost.
Can the Commissioner tell us how our partners have reacted up to now, apart from Morocco and Jordan, which he has already mentioned?
Can he also explain how the EUâs approach relates to the policy of the United States with regard to the region?
To what extent is there transatlantic coordination?
The proposed spur to action comes not a moment too soon.
Further deterioration in the region could have far-reaching consequences.
Many regimes say that security is more important than democracy.
This contradiction could hardly be more mistaken.
It is precisely a lack of democracy that makes the situation hopeless and dangerous.
Anyone striving for security and prosperity must first safeguard democracy and human rights.
I should like to hear answers from the Commissioner to my questions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, what is making things so very complicated, I believe, is the fact that we can never be sure of anything.
I heard you welcome the efforts of the Moroccan authorities.
For my part, I have just read the very recent report of the IFRM which was presented yesterday and which demonstrates the extent to which 11 September has had devastating effects in these countries, taking the form of many arbitrary imprisonments all over the place, which clearly represent a genuine violation of respect for human rights.
So while we welcome the very interesting and noteworthy progress made in relation to the family code, certain extremely worrying elements nevertheless remain.
I say this to demonstrate that the very considerable efforts agreed by the Commission and by this Parliament â which you stress yourselves â to reinforce all the mechanisms for action and assessment concerning respect for human rights are determined not only by the international context, but also by the relations that the EUâs Member States individually maintain with these different countries.
How many programmes will we need in order to cancel out the disastrous effect of President Chiracâs visit to Tunisia, where he stated that there were no human rights problems, and, in the middle of a hunger strike by an eminent lawyer, that the main right is the right to eat?
How many programmes will we need in order to remedy that?
We are well aware that, in the evaluation of the association agreements, the constraints of the on the part of the States are terrifying.
We truly need to consolidate the Community efforts resulting from the support of the associations, of the NGOs, of civil society and, as we know, of the Members of this Parliament and the Commission.
So there are actors who can perhaps overcome that handicap.
But I would like to ask you directly, Commissioner, about any responsibility you may have in this regard.
In Tunisia, how can we explain that, while the Ben Ali government is in the process of holding back the funds allocated to the Tunisian Human Rights League, the Commission is initiating a clearly nonsensical programme aimed at providing support for media that do not exist, which are shackled, entirely in the hands of Ben Ali?
Everybody knows that Ben Ali is going to use this not inconsiderable sum to fund his presidential propaganda.
Do you realise that or do you not?
How is such a thing possible?
That is something I really wonder about, as it is precisely on us that such a decision depends.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the European Union does indeed have every interest in creating an area of stability, security and democracy on the other side of the Mediterranean, and therefore any efforts it devotes towards this are by no means wasted.
Much remains to be done, however.
The situation in that region remains volatile.
Indeed, aid must not be misused for further tolerating conditions or for keeping regimes in power that have been violating human rights for years.
We, the European Union, must not perpetuate any taboos.
Major obstacles to the achievement of our objectives include the further rise of Islam on the one hand, and the continuing immigration problem on the other.
We must make it clear that further waves of immigration are in the interests of neither Maghreb countries nor Europe.
Those countries certainly do not stand to gain from the brain drain or other such phenomena.
Besides, further immigration hinders the integration of the immigrants already present in Europe.
We must continue to make an issue of this.
It is a matter of continuing our efforts to bring about greater democracy and stability in these countries, both in their interests and in ours, including in the context of the policy of good neighbourly relations that is now in the pipeline.
Â Â  Mr President, I have taken our Vice-President, MrÂ Dimitrakopoulos' chair, just to remind ourselves that democracy in the Mediterranean did not begin with this debate.
I thank the Commissioner, whose work as Governor of Hong Kong ensured the continuation of the democratic life of that territory, which I hope will spark changes in the wider China.
It is my pleasure to be rapporteur on the communication 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners'.
We welcome the communication and its ten points for action.
We note that it was published in 2003.
Since that time, the MEDA process has taken on a new lease of life, with the agreements in December to establish the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum.
In December also, the Council, while failing to agree on the European Constitution, did at least agree that the paper presented by the Commissioner and by the High Representative entitled 'Strengthening the EU's relations with the Arab world' would be adopted in March.
We welcome that.
I am also rapporteur on the two regulations dealing with the continuation of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2005 and 2006.
While endorsing the communication on 'Reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation with Mediterranean partners', we are also examining these two regulations.
Parliament will vote today on whether to have a say in the priorities and running of this programme, the European democracy initiative, because the resolution put forward by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy today points out that this fund, which uniquely requires no host country consent, should be more focused, especially on what I describe as the 'arc of instability' from Russia to Morocco, where democracy is fragile, or on the Arab world, where it is non-existent.
The Commissioner's references to the UNDP report underline the importance attached to it by the Commission, but unfortunately the Commission needs to put its money where its mouth is.
We need to examine very closely the way in which the European Union is funding programmes in this region.
For example, he mentioned a figure of EUR 100 million for good governance in the MEDA region.
In fact, in the wider Mediterranean, my understanding is that EUR 500Â million a year is available for good governance.
But of this, only EUR 7 million is currently budgeted through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
Reference has been made in this House this morning to forthcoming elections in Algeria and Tunisia, where very little money is getting through to the NGOs and activists who are looking for a free media and the development of human rights.
Unfortunately â I have had some experience as the originator of this democracy programme â it is now rather bureaucratic and errs on the side of safety.
The only way of dealing with this is to try and adapt it to the realities of the present situation.
An unstable world to our east and south demands special actions.
Having had experience of working in this field in the 1990s with the ex-Soviet Union, through an external agency which had an agility and freedom to manoeuvre not enjoyed by the Commission and the deniability not available to the Council, I can say that, with the advantage of Parliament's involvement, we have a much more effective programme.
I welcome the Commissioner's assertion that he will be open-minded about further suggestions we might make as a Parliament.
I intend to bring these forward, especially since I understand this morning that the Council has decided to withdraw the regulations as presented and to present them in a new format, thereby delaying yet further the adoption of the regulations.
This debate will continue.
Â Â  Mr President, we are in favour of and support the Commission's communication on reinvigorating EU actions on human rights and democratisation in the southern and eastern Mediterranean.
We are convinced that the enormous challenge of developing these neighbouring regions can only be possible, in terms of European responsibilities, if we combine responsibility and management.
In other words, through the sound implementation of association agreements with strong political and cultural impetus, in a context in which the norm is increasingly represented by voices and images of poverty, fanaticism and terrorism rather than by the aims of genuinely moving towards freedom, social cohesion and peace.
We therefore support this initiative and we advocate that in terms of the European Unionâs general policy, as far as human rights are concerned, we should not resort to closing our eyes, on the one hand, for the sake of a false , nor, on the other hand, be content with mere condemnations or protests.
We must be âconsequentialistâ in our policies towards the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean.
In other words, our priority must always be to consider the consequences of our policies in this regard.
As the Commissioner has said quite rightly, there is a strategy which will soon be ten years old â that of the Barcelona process â and all we have to do is remember that, since Barcelona is an Olympic city, the entrance to the Commission's offices should display the motto '' for the development of our Euro-Mediterranean policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, what is termed the Barcelona process certainly has all the sympathy of men and women of good will.
The capital of the Catalan nation was indeed worthy of being the place where a policy aimed at building bridges across the Mediterranean was launched.
I must mention here in passing the memory of two illustrious Catalans who anticipated this policy each in their own way in the Middle Ages: RaymondÂ Lull and Anselme Turmeda.
I welcome the intelligent and understanding effort implemented by this policy, and in particular in the documents which are the subject of our debate.
Nevertheless, given the general situation, I wonder about this policyâs chances.
In order to fly the flag for democracy and human rights, we must be exemplary.
We are far from it.
As recently as yesterday, lawyers in this lovely city of Strasbourg publicly placed a funeral wreath in front of the prefecture mourning the death of the presumption of innocence as a result of a law which has just been voted on in France.
A year ago, a Spanish judge ordered the closure of , the only daily newspaper in the Basque language, and imprisoned several journalists â some are still in prison.
To this day, one year later, no contradictory debate has been organised to justify this blatant violation of press freedom.
The criminal war waged by the United States against Iraq was subject to the active or passive complicity of the majority of Member States of the enlarged Union.
This horrific wound is still bleeding, and it will do so for a long time.
For many Muslims in the world it is an additional humiliation.
This list is unfortunately far from exhaustive.
If we are not careful, the obsession with security and the hijacking of the war against terror for partisan ends will undermine this policy, and many others, despite all the intelligence and good will of those who will try to implement it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I think that if we want to implement a policy in this area, it is important to know what is happening in the Mediterranean and in the Arab world.
The signals we are receiving are weak, perhaps superficial, perhaps devised with the ulterior motive of doing nothing at all, but what is not in doubt is that, in the last two years, signals have been sent, which we would do well to pick up on and pursue.I say this because I have the impression that there is very little awareness of this in our Member States.
MrsÂ Flautre who spoke before me has, for example, already highlighted the Tunisian issue, with a series of extremely conflicting positions, and perhaps it is not a coincidence that it was two representatives from Tunisian civil society that were prevented from taking part in the afore-mentioned Sanaâa Conference: this is the only thing that I was able to notice in the organisation of this conference.
From this point of view, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must stop being excessively prudent because our actions must have credibility.
We lose credibility, for example, when we do not enforce the clauses of ArticleÂ 2: we are not credible in the eyes of governmentsÂ âÂ who, in fact, consider us to be relatively malleable partnersÂ âÂ nor are we in the eyes of non-governmental actors, whose trust we are losing.
I say this because, for example, we are drawing closer to the meeting for the ratification of the Lebanon Agreement and I believe, Commissioner, that it is important to note, in this House, the lack of progress on the independence of Lebanonâs judiciary and the fact that relations with the European Union should be subject to this requirement being met.
Aside from individual references to specific positions, I believe that action by the European Commission or Europe in general is important: there is much demand for EuropeÂ âÂ perhaps in comparison with the alternativeÂ âÂ and great things are expected of it.
The importance of Sanaâa has been stressed here.
Why is it important, Commissioner?
Well, it is important because of the format of the Conference: governments and non-governmental actors have for the first time found themselves on an equal footing in discussing and wrangling, but also in creating a final statement that, in my opinion, creates the requirements for a consultation process, which perhaps our US friends are less prone to emphasise and less inclined towards.
I believe that it would be an important signal, Commissioner, in the context of our discussion, to ensure that Sanaâa is followed up, in such a way that it does not remain just one of many such events but becomes a process that is monitored.
The involvement of women has also been extraordinary and exceptional vitality came from womenâs organisations, which really must be given assistance.
We therefore have something to work on, Commissioner, that has arisen from the consultation we held with our partners and from the texts they have produced, a course of action that cannot be said to be handed down from above, because it has been requested by the partners themselves.
I believe that this merits a very solid follow-up.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I can sympathise a little with Commissioner Patten who has to listen to one speech after another without being able to make comments after any of the speakers.
Perhaps this type of debate or, rather, series of monologues that we have in the European Parliament could be a touch more lively.
As one of the last speakers, I hope that the Commissioner will nonetheless manage to listen to one more speaker.
I wish, in fact, to refer to two things mentioned by the Commissioner for External Relations in his speech.
The first thing he emphasised was that we must improve relations between Europe and the Islamic world. We must develop more stable, more secure and more pluralistic countries in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean.
The second thing the Commissioner said concerned the links between our financial support and behaviour at what he called grass roots level, that is to say how matters appear out in the cities, towns and villages when it comes to observing human rights.
