It is fitting that today we express our concern and continued support for democracy and dialogue in Belarus, and we must consider stronger action in the future if the repression continues.
Â Â  The parliamentary elections in Ukraine have become aÂ major milestone following the consolidation that began with the Orange Revolution.
During the elections, the Ukrainians have shown that they cherish the freedom they gained in taking to the streets.
They clearly confirmed their desire to become part of the European Union, on the basis of sharing its fundamental principles and criteria.
It is commendable that the European Parliament has not confined itself to merely supporting the Orange Revolution but that it is also constantly monitoring developments in Ukraine through its observers.
Parliamentary democracy must not be taken for granted.
It must be gradually established and must be looked after.
As an immediate neighbour, Slovakia has aÂ vested interest in Ukraineâs success.
Slovakia will be helping Ukraine to get to where it belongs, that is, within the fold of EU Member States.
Naturally, this will not happen overnight, and the European Union should therefore offer aÂ form of partnership that would develop Ukraineâs European perspective.
The joint resolution demonstrates that the European Parliament is politically mature, capable of reaching political agreement based on a broad consensus, and sending aÂ clear signal to the Ukrainian people.
IÂ have therefore voted in favour of the resolution.
Â Â  . I will vote for this resolution.
On Boxing Day 2004 I was in Kiev as one of Parliamentâs observers for the re-run presidential elections that saw the Orange revolution sweep all before it.
But its promise has not been properly fulfilled as former allies fall out and corruption is found within the ranks of those promising to sweep it away.
I can only hope that these new elections teach all of Ukraineâs politicians the lessons that must be learnt if Ukraine is to join Europeâs democratic nations in going forward in partnership.
Â Â  â It insultingly disdains and does not recognise the results of the elections in Belarus, but considers 'democratic' the elections in Ukraine, which were held in a climate of violence and forgery, targeted specifically at the communist party of Ukraine.
The 'international observers' and the representatives of the EU and imperialism failed to see the murders of two communist party cadres, the attacks on its offices, the writing off of 200Â 000 voters in the Lugansk region who did not vote and the forgeries in the Crimea.
Of course, this was not because the reports on the 'validity and democracy of the elections' were written before the elections.
The ÎU and the European Parliament consider countries subjugated to imperialism and occupying governments, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and the political forces that sell off the interests of their workers and countries to capital to be democratic.
That is why they welcome the results in Ukraine, even if their chosen representative went under.
'Operation democracy' being promoted by the USA and the EU through their transnational and international organisations is basically the imposition of capitalism and the attaching of countries to the imperialist chariot.
The political forces which support, consent to and tolerate this policy are complicit and jointly responsible towards the people.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Orange Revolution was a time of so much hope, yet it is clear that the transition to a functioning democracy remains a painful one for Ukraine.
We in this House must play our part, as we did in the Orange Revolution itself, though today we must continue to support the forces of progress and democracy within the Ukraine.
The EU is in the best position to play honest broker, adviser and even friend to the Ukrainians; we must continue our engagement with this process and I am pleased to support this resolution today.
Â Â  . This resolution raises the very serious problem that the developed world is siphoning off the educated elites of the developing world, particularly in the medical sector.
Indeed, we are witnessing an absolutely appalling situation.
In my country, France, a lack of foresight as to the healthcare needs of an ageing population, uninspiring career prospects and the application of the 35-hour week in public hospitals have led to a major shortage of staff.
But a continues to limit access to these professions, and we recruit doctors and nurses from abroad.
At the same time, people in the developing countries do not have access to healthcare, and we spend large amounts of money on sending humanitarian missions, often to restricted areas.
It is completely crazy, particularly given that access to healthcare is now one of the reasons for mass illegal immigration: the French island of Mayotte, which is being overwhelmed, is a perfect example of this.
I should like to take this opportunity to denounce the immigration law 'chosen' by Mr Sarkozy, which will organise this siphoning off of elites on a grand scale, further compromising the development of the countries from which these elites come, and automatically aggravating emigration, while a bankrupt education system has given up on training a generation condemned to unemployment or dead-end jobs.
Â Â  The global fight against diseases and poverty is a very important issue demanding large-scale international commitment.
We are, however, of the view that the issue should not be handled within the framework of EU cooperation.
We believe that the fight against ill health should be conducted by individual EU Member States and within the framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The June List seeks limited EU cooperation within this area and would prefer to see aid policy renationalised.
We are also opposed to the EU having influence on, and extending its powers in relation to, issues already dealt with by other international organisations.
We are therefore voting against this resolution.
Â Â  The report discusses a crucial issue in relation to EU aid, namely its ineffectiveness.
The June Listâs position is that aid should not be provided by the EU but by each Member State.
Just as the rapporteur points out, EU aid is ineffective.
At the same time as relatively large amounts are invested in conducting a development policy organised by the EU, new EU barriers to trade are added to existing ones, making it impossible for the worldâs poor countries to enter the EU market with their products.
Moreover, the EUâs common policy on trade and agriculture is very harmful because, with its duties and subsidies, it renders developing countriesâ agricultural products uncompetitive.
If the report had been about aid at Member State level, we should naturally have voted in favour of it, because inefficiency and corruption are two great obstacles to constructive and effective development cooperation.
What, however, we are concerned with in this case is aid organised by the EU, which is why we have voted against the report in its entirety.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on aid effectiveness and corruption in developing countries.
Corruption is a by-product of weak governance.
As corruption often involves an important role for the state, it is sometimes defined as the abuse of public power for private benefit.
Weak institutions and administrations with limited accountability often allow for the misuse of public goods by politicians or public officials.
I believe that increasing the role of parliaments is vital to the advancement of reforms in public finance management and that there should be instituting or reinforcing mechanisms within parliament for bringing government to account.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would add my voice of congratulation to our Rapporteur on this report, which deals with an issue that is crucial to the aid agenda, yet it is often glossed over.
The extent to which aid and development funding, so well meant, encourages corruption is often very disturbing, and to ensure value for money for our taxpayers and the citizens of the recipient countries, we must continue to look into this.
I wholeheartedly endorse the recommendations in this report and am happy to support it today.
Â Â  That concludes the statements of vote.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission statement on the situation in the South-East of Turkey.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is concerned about the events occurring in the south-east of Turkey and about the outbursts of violence and terrorist attacks that have spread to other cities in the country.
We are closely following the situation.
According to the information available to the Commission, an outburst of violence started on 28Â March, in the south-eastern city of Diyarbakir following the funeral of PKK members.
May I remind honourable Members that the PKK is included in the European Unionâs list of terrorist organisations.
The first victims were reported on 29Â March in Diyarbakir and other fatalities were reported in the following days throughout the region.
Over the weekend, riots also spread to Istanbul, where a Molotov cocktail was thrown into a crowded city bus.
Three civilians were killed.
Since then other fatalities have been reported, including among the security forces.
Let me be clear, the European Union unequivocally condemns terrorism.
The PKK is a terrorist organisation.
We are deeply concerned about its recent activities in Turkey.
We feel that we are victims of these terrorist acts.
But at the same time, we deeply deplore human casualties and call on the Turkish authorities to shed light on those events, through a comprehensive investigation, and to make sure that the security forces show the necessary strength in face of the demonstrators.
The people in the south-east of Turkey do not need violence and confrontation; they need peace, stability and prosperity.
We urge the Turkish Government to address in a comprehensive mannerÂ â and not only from the security point of viewÂ â the problems of this region and of its people, who are for the most part of Kurdish origin.
The Turkish Government should take action with a view to enhancing and ensuring economic, social and cultural opportunities for all Turkish citizens.
In this respect, we look forward to the follow-up of Prime MinisterÂ Erdoganâs speech in August 2005.
The Commission recalls and stresses that under the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey must ensure cultural diversity and promote the cultural rights of all its citizens as set out in the revised Accession Partnership adopted by the Council in JanuaryÂ 2006.
It is also important that Turkey facilitates the return of internally displaced people to their original settlements, ensures fair compensation for those who have suffered loss and damage as a result of the security situation, and addresses the abolition of the village guard system.
We will continue to monitor the situation in the south-east.
We will raise these issues with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria.
I am looking forward to a very interesting debate.
Â Â  . Mr President, the situation we are discussing here this afternoon is tragic, because recent events have been very bad for Turkey and for the Kurdish citizens of Turkey.
Let us be clear, the PPK is a terrorist organisation and there is never an excuse for terrorism.
I am saying as a parliamentarian that the national parliament of the Netherlands fought hard to get the PKK on the terrorist list.
There can never be an excuse.
However, at the same time, we must ask ourselves whether all the people who are protesting really support violence.
Many analysts have drawn a completely different conclusion.
They say that most Kurdish people do not want violence, they just want to have a prosperous future â with economic, social and cultural developments â within the state of Turkey.
Now, more than ever, we need to invest in those people.
In Parliamentâs report adopted at the end of 2004, we pressed for the development of the south east and for more cultural rights for the Kurdish people.
It must be said that Prime Minister Erdogan has made impressive speeches since that time.
However, at this difficult time these words must be followed more than ever by deeds.
We must invest socially and economically so that people and their families have a prosperous future, so that they do not want violence for their children.
We have to invest in more cultural freedom.
If Turkish television and radio provided more air time for Kurdish programmes, then Roj TV in Denmark will not be that important any more.
Indeed, the village guard system should be abolished and displaced people should be helped to return to their home regions.
Now is the time for wisdom instead of big words.
It is time the Turkish Government tried to find interlocutors who are modest and want peace. I name Mr Baydemir and Mr TÃŒrk, the co-leader of the DTP.
These people must continue to speak out against violence; but if they continue to do so, let the Turkish Government cooperate with them instead of a Minister of the Interior threatening to bring them to justice.
I think cooperation is the way; wisdom is the way.
Let us ensure that Kurdish citizens feel at home in one Turkish state.
That is the only solution.
Â Â  . Mr President, Turkey is close to the heart of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and so it is heartrending to see that country plagued by violence.
The PSE Group is calling for an end to the escalation of violence, and we welcome Prime Minister Erdoganâs indication of his intention to turn the tide of violence by bringing about more democratic and economic reforms.
By doing this, he has extended a hand to the Kurdish community, which, though, has yet to accept this gesture.
The PSE Group would also draw your attention to the appeal made by the Mayor of Diyarbakir to those Kurds who use violence, to abandon this strategy, because my group emphatically denounces excessive violence.
If the violence stops, the tanks can, and indeed must, leave the streets of the towns and villages in the south-east.
Tanks in the streets are not what people in Europe want to see when they consider the possibility of Turkey joining the European Union.
I would like to stress that everyone in Turkey, including the Kurds, stands to benefit if Turkeyâs progress down the road to EU membership is uninterrupted.
Indeed, the protection of, and respect for, human rights of everyone in Turkey is a for EU membership.
We must not allow agitators to sabotage the negotiations before they have got well and truly underway.
It is unfortunate that the current violence interrupts a period of , because some progress had already been made, for example, by the Turkish Government making Kurdish television possible.
The agreements that were in place before the recent outbreak of violence must be further developed and, above all, implemented.
That which has been committed to paper must be translated into reality.
I should like to finish off with a few words for the victims, for it is right that they should be remembered and mourned.
There must be no more of them.
I urge you to turn this difficult moment in Turkey into an opportunity for renewed solidarity in that country, which is desperately needed on the long and difficult road to EU membership.
Â Â  . Mr President, clearly there is an unholy alliance â though an unacknowledged and unintended alliance â between the Turkish security forces, the PKK and the European opponents of Turkeyâs accession.
They are all doing their bit in their own way to impede Turkeyâs progress towards the European Union.
The Turkish police and army are not serving the interests of the Turkish Government in their excessive use of force against protestors in Diyarbakir and other towns.
The deep state is not under the democratic control of that government.
The fact is the military has a vested interest in the prolongation of the violence, because that enhances its power, its importance and its resources.
The PKK does employ terrorist methods, and it has no doubt provoked and stirred up some of the recent violence, but its aims of achieving recognition of the cultural, linguistic and political identity of the Kurdish people are shared by many Kurds who do not espouse violence.
To that extent, the PKK are seen as freedom fighters.
The challenge, one where the Turkish authorities are failing, is to separate the die-hard opponents of violence and those who want to pursue a democratic route to a political solution.
A very hopeful development over the last few days has been the very moderate calls by people like Ahmed TÃŒrk and Osman Baydemir, the major of Diyarbakir, for an end to the violence and for political discussions.
I somewhat regret that the Commission did not say anything about encouraging the Turkish Government to go down this route: not only of social and economic progress, which clearly is needed, not only of the recognition of linguistic and cultural rights, but of actually talking about political dialogue and a political solution in the Kurdish region in south-east Turkey in the construction of the Turkish State.
The Commission seems to baulk at giving the Turkish Government that encouragement.
We all need to rally round and encourage Prime Minister Erdogan to carry on where he seemed to start last August but where he has stalled, no doubt because of the army.
We all need to help him get the political dialogue for a solution going.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his speech.
I would like to express, on behalf of my Group, our great concern about the situation in Turkey that we have seen in the media.
Over the past week at least 15 people have lost their lives in clashes between demonstrators and Turkish security forces in the south-east and in terrorist attacks in Istanbul.
We strongly condemn the disproportionate use of force by police forces in Diyarbakir and Kiziltepe.
But at the same time, we vehemently denounce the provocations by the PKK, whose leaders deliberately stir up violence and riots.
After three municipal buses in Istanbul were burnt without any casualties, two young sisters were killed on Sunday evening when a bus was attacked.
The majority of the Kurds, who wish to build a decent life in the towns or to return to their villages, should not be hostage to cynical leadership associated with the military wing of the PKK which wants to escalate the conflict, as well as some people in the âdeep stateâ in Turkey.
In the light of the recent events we have the feeling that some of our colleagues in the European Parliament were not telling the whole story in the e-mails that were circulated recently.
They give the impression of a black and white situation in which no Turk wants to grant more rights to the Kurds and every Kurd is an oppressed victim.
That is why I believe it is important that we draw attention to the debate that is currently going on in civil society in Turkey, amongst intellectuals of Turkish and Kurdish origin.
Let me point out what they have said: first, Kurdish identity in Turkey must finally be officially recognised by the Turkish state; second, the policy for assimilating Kurds has been a complete failure; third, the Turkish state has to make sure that it gets back the trust of the Kurds and every citizen of Turkey; fourth, there cannot be any peaceful solution that insists that the PKK is the official negotiation partner of the state, because that will not happen.
I finish by quoting a former mayor of Diyarbakir, who has just pointed out: âIf we are going to have real peace here, the PKK has to adjust itself to the new world situation.
The Turkish state is becoming more democratic.
The PKK needs to do the same.
It should give up the idea of armed struggle and open respectful dialogue with Kurds who think differently.
It also needs to renovate its leadership.
This organisation was formed with a Cold War mentality.
It needs to evolveâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and in particular of my colleague Mr Agnoletto, I would like to express my horror at the violent clashes in South-Eastern Turkey.
For over a week, we have been seeing horrifying pictures, and getting horrifying reports, from a country with which the EU commenced accession negotiations in October 2005, to which, at that time, my group colleagues and I consented.
Although, since commencing accession talks with the EU, the Turkish Government has initiated a reform process, it is not one that will be sufficient to resolve the countryâs social and political problems and conflicts.
Where these are concerned, there is one thing that should be clear to Turkey and to all of us, and that is that Turkeyâs democratic deficits were and are closely tied up with the Kurdish question.
For as long as Turkey tries to resolve this problem by military means, suppressing the civilian population and suppressing the free expression of opinions and ideas, there will be no peace in the land and hence no basis for a democratic state.
The chasm running through its society must not be allowed to become even deeper, to the point of becoming unbridgeable.
The Turkish Head of State, Mr Erdogan, has described the murders of women and children as necessary interventions to deal with the instruments of terrorism.
To date, 15 people have lost their lives, including three children, the youngest of whom was aged only three.
Of the 278 persons detained in Diyarbakir, 91 are under the age of 18.
If the Turkish security forces continue to shoot at civilians in Diyarbakir, Batman, Mardin and in many other Kurdish cities, and if the death toll rises still higher, then this chasm will become wider and the prospect of a peaceful solution more distant.
It is now high time for the Commission and the Council to use all the means at their disposal to bring pressure on Turkey to end the violence.
The possibility needs to be discussed of the accession negotiations being suspended if the Turkish Government and the Turkish army continue to disregard democratic principles and violate human rights.
I call for an delegation to be sent to Turkey to get to the bottom of what is going on there.
I appeal to all those involved in the conflict to cease forthwith from violence, and I call on the Turkish Government to accept the Kurdsâ lawfully elected representatives as negotiating partners and to drop the latest charges against them.
It cannot â it must not â be tolerated any longer that 20 million Kurds should be denied their political and cultural rights and a say in how their society is shaped.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is with regret that we observe the outbreaks of violence in south-east Turkey and with disgust that we see soldiers and innocent civilians being murdered in Turkey.
Nonetheless, this must not lead us to conclude that this is the only problem in Turkey: there is a major problem in connection with the rights of Kurds, which is something we should not sweep under the carpet in today's debate.
Turkey has chosen its prospects.
It has chosen European prospects and, thanks to these prospects, we have seen some progress over recent years on the question of the human rights of the Kurds, whose existence was barely recognised a few years ago.
However, Turkey must continue on this course.
The recent uncontrolled interventions by the army must not deprive the Kurds of the rights which they must have if Turkey is to become a member of the European Union, by which I mean the rights enjoyed by the citizens of European states.
Prime Minister Erdogan announced recently that Turkey would not step away from its objective of democracy and development and that it would introduce greater freedoms, more democracy, social assistance, rights and justice.
This announcement is all well and good, but it needs to be more than just an announcement; it needs to be put into practice.
Measures are needed on three levels: firstly rights are needed; secondly, economic and social policy is needed and, thirdly, the army, which has uncontrolled powers, needs to be restricted.
If these measures are introduced, Turkey will have taken its European prospects seriously and if Turkey honours its commitments in both this area and in all the other areas stipulated by the European Union, this will be to the benefit both of the Kurds and of all the citizens of Turkey.
Turkey should not therefore hesitate: Mr Erdogan's words must go hand in hand with action from now on.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are extremely concerned about the revival of violence and the acts of terrorism by the Turkish army and the PKK.
I believe that the message to come out of our debate today must be a message of condemnation of the acts of terrorism against innocent civilians in Istanbul and other towns and of the military violence by the Turkish forces of repression against the Kurdish population.
The powers pushing for war and for the army to stay in power at all costs are responsible for the situation in south-east Turkey.
The powers that be and the army in Turkey find in the action of the PKK a convenient pretext for continuing to intervene in political life and trying to define the terms of the resolution to the Kurdish problem.
On the other hand, the PKK is taking advantage of the serious economic and social problems of under-development and poverty to feed with its actions the cycle of violence and bloodshed.
It is a fact, and it would be a political mistake for us to underestimate it, that Turkey's European prospects paved the way for reforms by the Erdogan government.
However, reforms are still at an early stage, are incomplete and are driven by the historic fear of the Turkish people against the Kurdish people.
We must support consistently and decisively the cultural, linguistic and education rights of the Kurdish community; we must support political rights; we must call for the electoral law prohibiting the democratic representation of the Kurdish community in the political life of Turkey to be amended.
The Turkish political leadership and the Erdogan government are responsible for proceeding with courage and decisiveness to complete the reforms and for the smooth political, economic and social integration of the Kurdish people.
A strategy of peaceful resolution depends on dialogue between the two sides.
It presupposes the renunciation, by both sides, of the philosophy of military conflict and of the solution.
The Kurdish problem will be resolved not on terms of suppression and violence, but on terms of democratic dialogue, development and the flourishing of the rights of the Kurdish people.
The European Union has its political responsibility for formulating an integrated strategy for the Kurdish problem in Turkey:
- it must remain a constant and consistent supporter of its European prospects, while at the same time controlling, without concessions and expediencies, the honouring of obligations by Turkey;
- it must confirm its support for the territorial integrity and unity of the Turkish state and condemn the objectives of secession in the dead-end strategy of the PKK;
- it must take initiatives to start democratic dialogue on a political solution to the Kurdish problem and on the safeguarding of the role and rights of the Kurdish community in the institutions and society of Turkey.
Finally, the European Union, in cooperation with Turkish and Kurdish agencies, must help to formulate and implement economic and social reconstruction programmes to combat poverty and under-development, support the institutions and civil society and support the democratic moderate political forces in the area of south-east Turkey.
Â Â  Mr President, the situation in south-east Turkey is indeed extremely worrying but should not surprise anyone.
Violence and gross abuse of human rights, largely by the Turkish State, have been practised on and off in that region for decades and they will continue to occur for many years to come unless the Turkish Government recognises that the Kurdish problem will not go away simply by giving the army generals a free hand to deal with it in the only way they know how: by brute force.
The Turkish Government must understand that the millions of Kurdish people living in the region must have their human rights fully respected.
They must have the right to use their own language, Kurdish, and to uphold their traditions and culture.
Furthermore, the Turkish Government must accept that the Kurdish people are entitled to a degree of autonomy.
If such an eventuality were to be negotiated, it would not adversely affect the wellbeing of the Turkish people; through the establishment of long-lasting stability, it would bring peace and prosperity to the whole of Turkey.
In addition, the Turkish Government must take the brave step of acceding to the recent request by Kurdistan Democratic Party leader Masood Barzani to accept the federal structure of Iraq and to declare a general amnesty for PKK militants.
Mr Erdoganâs Government has given signs of aspiring to achieve drastic democratic reforms in Turkey.
We know that such reforms are greatly resisted by the deeply entrenched military establishment.
The Turkish people must understand that those who resist change are in fact the real enemies of Turkey.
MrÂ Erdogan is fighting a difficult battle, full of danger, with the army generals.
We must encourage and support him because, if the generals win, Turkeyâs progress towards democratisation will be halted, as will its progress towards EU accession, and the country will sink once again into the backwardness of military totalitarian control.
Â Â  Mr President, I declare an interest in this debate as patron of the Peace in Kurdistan campaign and a board member of the EU-Turkey Civic Commission.
I endorse utterly my group colleague Mr Ãzdemirâs remarks about dialogue and how this process is not black and white.
All sides have their shortcomings and we in this House must continue to encourage where necessary, and criticise where necessary.
We must also, I stress, keep an eye to our own integrity and ensure that legitimate concerns about the painfully slow progress of the peace process within Kurdistan and Turkey as a whole does not become a cipher for those within this House and within the EU who are more anti-Turkish EU membership than they are pro-democracy.
The Copenhagen criteria constitute the roadmap.
The Copenhagen criteria on recognition of cultural, historic and political rights are clear, they are already laid down.
We in this House must keep our own hands clean.
The EU as a champion of dialogue and democracy must ensure that we always remember our own principles and our own role as honest, impartial broker, able to help and criticise where necessary.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the European Union opened accession negotiations with Turkey, we have received reports of violence and serious human rights violations on a weekly basis, and that is a fact.
You yourself gave us a list, but I would like to bring to your attention the brutal murder of the elderly parents of the Kurdish Instituteâs chairman in Brussels, although the other victims should not, of course, be forgotten.
Commissioner Rehnâs first response was to affirm his faith in the Turkish Government, an attitude that I find somewhat strange given that there is increasing evidence of those selfsame authorities playing an active role in this.
I do not know whether you have seen the report of the IHD human rights organisation about the killing of Mr and Mrs Ferho, or the judicial inquiry into the bomb attack in Åemdinli.
They both point in the direction of the Turkish army.
When a few weeks ago, a public prosecutor wanted to investigate the direct involvement of the armyâs second-in-command â who is also expected to become Chief of Staff â the army immediately vetoed the idea.
These, then, are the authorities in whom the European Commission has blind faith.
I have to say, Commissioner, that these incidents do make it painfully clear that Turkey is in no way striving towards a peaceful solution to the conflict with the Kurds.
Turkey simply refuses to recognise that the Turkish Kurds possess cultural and democratic rights of self-determination.
A country that denies 15 million citizens all political and cultural rights is not what I would call a democracy.
Nor, as I see it, can a country whose authorities are actively involved in serious violations of human and international law be described as a constitutional state.
Ignoring this reality and failing to send out a powerful message from Europe makes us an accessory.
I really would like to know what the Commission intends to do in this respect.
Will Commissioner Rehn at long last deliver on his promise and include the protection of the minorities in the association agreement or will he not?
One crucial step, I think, could be for the European Union to do what Turkey does not do, or refuses to do, and enter into a direct and structural dialogue with representatives of the Kurdish community in Turkey on this matter.
I would like to hear your opinion on this.
Â Â  Mr President, in my view the greatest service that could be given to the people of south-eastern Turkey is for Kurdish extremist groups to cease their campaign of violence and terrorism.
It is a characteristic of terrorist campaigns that their victims are, for the most part, ordinary civilians who want nothing more than to have a fair chance of bringing up their children in an atmosphere of peace, stability, freedom and increasing prosperity.
None of that can be delivered while terrorists and insurgents pursue their own selfish ends, oppress, intimidate and mobilise Kurdish communities at home and abroad, and seek to inflame international opinion against the Turkish authorities.
I do not imagine that there is very much freedom of opinion in those areas dominated by the PKK.
From time to time the PKK, an organisation with its roots in the Cold War, has declared a ceasefire.
The most recent of those was last August, for less than a month.
Since then it has continued its campaign of violence and murder.
Since last weekend, as the Commissioner and other speakers have mentioned, over a dozen people have died as a result of terrorist violence.
Over the years the victims of terrorism have numbered tens of thousands.
Turkeyâs EU accession negotiations are now under way.
That is itself a factor in the PKK campaign.
The PKK is not interested in a stable, thriving and democratic Turkey oriented to the West.
It would prefer its own little Marxist state, living in the past.
Of course we want to see reforms in Turkey as part of a modernising agenda; of course we want to see great economic improvements in south-eastern Turkey.
I feel enormous sympathy for people that live in poverty and fear.
We want reasonable Kurdish concerns to be resolved in a just and fair way through negotiation.
None of that can be achieved with a background of violence or the continuing threat of violence.
The Kurdish extremists must end their terrorism.
The Turkish authorities can then respond in a spirit of goodwill.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank Members for this very interesting discussion.
I have listened with great interest to your remarks and these were duly noted.
I think we can all conclude that the situation in south-east Turkey is serious and, therefore, we all look forward to that situation being addressed vigorously through a comprehensive strategy, encompassing not just security concerns â which are legitimate â but also the socio-economic development of the region and the development of cultural rights.
I should like to refer to Prime Minister Erdoganâs speech of August 2005 â which I mentioned earlier â in which he emphasised the need to resolve through democratic means what he described as âthe Kurdish issueâ.
The Commission will encourage the Turkish Government and its Prime Minister to take steps based on the commitment they made in that speech in Diyarbakir.
The stability of the region is key to properly addressing those issues and the continuation of terrorist attacks represents a serious threat in this respect.
At the same time, it is very important that the security forces and the authorities show restraint and do not use excessive force when they deal with civilians.
I should like to comment on a few issues raised by Members.
With regard to the Semdinli incidents, I should like to say that investigations are going on both in the judiciary but also in the parliament and we are awaiting the outcome of those investigations and we will continue to follow the situation.
I have noted the issue of progress and we are continually encouraging the Turkish Government to continue with the reforms and to extend more rights to the Kurdish people.
I refer to the recent development â at least it is a positive step â of allowing broadcasts in the Kurdish language at certain times on the television and radio.
We expect more to be done in this respect.
I can assure Members that we will continue to monitor the situation in the south east.
All these issues will be raised with the Turkish authorities as part of our regular monitoring of the political criteria.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Darfur(1).
Â Â  . â Mr President, we have had repeated occasion to discuss the situation in Darfur, albeit not for some time, even though things there have taken a lamentable and tragic turn for the worse.
Even in the few months that have passed since this year began, according to Mr Egeland, the UN Vice-Secretary-General with responsibility for Darfur, over 200Â 000 people have been driven from their homes and over 96 villages have been burned to the ground â and all this over a year since international action was taken with the intention of putting a stop to this sort of thing.
This goes to show how incredibly feeble the international community is where Darfur is concerned, and the fact that the UNâs Vice-Secretary-General was prevented from travelling into the crisis zone in the first place shows that the Khartoum regime is quite blatantly defying and cold-shouldering the international community and thereby making of it a laughing stock.
That is why it is past high time that we put a stop to our recurrent feeble protests; what is needed instead is for the United Nations, NATO, the USA, the European Union and the African Union to get together around one table in order, at last, to implement a concerted Darfur policy that amounts to more than paper resolutions.
What is called for, then, is a far more massive intervention there than has been seen hitherto.
It is, of course, the African Union, above all others, that needs to do something, but we ourselves cannot stand idly by while, quite openly, genocide is being committed â and that is how the United States has openly described it, even though they have not drawn the necessary conclusions from that.
What we are dealing with here is, quite simply, genocide.
We are currently mounting sad commemorative events to remember the beginning of the genocide in Rwanda and Burundi â and we averted our eyes from those, too.
Today, everyone says that we should have intervened then.
We find ourselves in a similar situation today.
We look away, we do not act, we do not use the means available to us â weak enough though they are â and instead content ourselves with verbal protests.
That makes Darfur not only a disgrace to the Sudanese regime, but also to the international and European institutions.
That is why I am very glad that we in this House are again returning to this issue.
To put it simply, it must be abundantly clear to us that normal or more or less normal relation with Sudan will be possible only if it for once does as it has promised and allows the international institutions to do their work there.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, when a mission from the Committee on Development visited Darfur in September 2004, we were shocked to see at first hand people sheltering under twigs because their village had been bombed.
We pushed hard at that time for a strengthening of the African Union monitoring mission, and in October 2004 it was indeed extended to include the protection of civilians who were under imminent threat.
The tragedy is that 18 months on, bombings, attacks and rapes are still taking place, despite the best efforts of the African Union both in the Abuja peace talks and on the ground in Darfur.
There are simply not enough African Union troops to be able to control the high level of violence that is taking place, particularly near the Chad border and in the corridor between Tawila and Graida.
That is why the UN must get involved in Darfur as a matter of urgency.
The UN needs to back the African Union during the remainder of its mandate and be prepared to take over in October 2006.
The Government of Sudan says that this is colonialism.
It is not.
It is a sad recognition that earlier initiatives to rein in the violence have largely failed.
Even the humanitarian effort in Darfur is now under threat, because access to the humanitarian agencies is being obstructed.
With over 3.5 million people dependent on food aid and medical aid, we cannot just stand by.
The violence has to stop.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ever since I was first elected, we have debated the situation in Sudan.
What is it that is happening there?
Imagine a single friend being killed and the degree of tragedy and misery entailed in that death.
Imagine, then, 180Â 000 friends having now died in the conflict.
Imagine a single friend having his house burned down and being forced to leave his home.
How does that feel?
Imagine now those tears being multiplied by two million in Darfur today.
Imagine the rape of a single relative, and imagine the same thing happening to tens of thousands of others.
That is the extent of the humanitarian disaster to have hit Sudan.
So what is the government doing?
In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it disarm the Janjaweed guerrillas, yet nothing happens.
In resolution after resolution we have demanded that it cooperate with the international community in order to help its own population, but very little indeed happens.
Matters are not helped by the fact that the UN envoy, Jan Egeland, is refused permission to travel to Darfur whenever he considers it appropriate.
The Commission is now already giving EURÂ 160Â million and my own country SEKÂ 330Â million by way of aid.
If this money is to be of any use, the regime needs to cooperate rather than seek to thwart our efforts.
I think that we should impose an arms embargo, irrespective of what Russia and China say, and that all the countries that give their support to an arms embargo should help one another and help prevent the arms embargo from being breached.
What is more, to imprison women who resist rape is absurd, and the four young women in question should, of course, be released immediately.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, in Darfur, millions of people are on the run.
The refugee camps are packed as a result of the extensive and chaotic flight of people in need, attacked by rebels and by the Janjaweed, often with stories of pillage and rape to tell.
This is a hopeless situation; the African Union is too weak and the Sudanese Government appears to be backing the Janjaweed and to be unwilling to give international rule of law, represented by the African Union and the United Nations, a chance.
It seems to be backed in this by China and Russia.
Yesterday, it became known that MrÂ Pronk, the UNâs special envoy in Darfur, is resigning from his post.
If even MrÂ Pronk, who I know as an incorrigible go-getter and optimist, no longer sees a chance for the peace process, then it is really time for us to sound the alarm.
In Darfur, an unprecedented brutal conflict is raging, one that gives the European Union the opportunity to show what its role outside of Europe can be.
This week, the one-hundred-day Rwandan genocide is being depicted here in a photo exhibition.
This event epitomises the failings of the entire international community.
We are now once again being put to the test.
While China and Russia veto every action, the African Union is still trying to get the Sudanese Government on board, but it is too little, too late and too long-drawn-out.
It is now up to the European troika, by means of money and backing of the African Unionâs peace force, to establish an actual presence in order to provide logistical support, access to food aid and protection for the people.
This chaotic massacre, characterised by an unprecedentedly cruel conflict of interests, must finally stop.
Todayâs appeal by our House in an excellent common resolution gives clear direction and impetus to Mr Solana, the Council, the Commission, and to our governments too.
The credibility of Europeâs role in the world is at stake.
Â Â  . â It is a strange fact that until oil was found in southern Sudan, Darfur was not talked about very much.
Crop farmers tended to their fields, livestock farmers herded their animals.
It is obvious that the Darfur region has a special attraction for some people.
Secession attempts by potentially wealthy regions in Africa are nothing new.
Let us not forget Biafra, Katanga and other problematic parts of a continent that is rich in natural resources.
Where there is no such wealth, there are no such massive problems.
After all, we will certainly find not only Russian and Chinese weapons in the region but also in the foreign military bases in Chad we will find weapons from other countries.
The interesting aspect is that we are concerned that the UN General Secretary has not been allowed into Darfur.
When there were similar events in Eritrea, Parliament approved humanitarian aid for the government.
Why should our resolution, under paragraph 7, not call on the EU, the USA and others to help bring the situation in Eritrea to an end as well?
Although the Sudanese regime is certainly not a paragon of democracy, it would be wrong to resort to force to resolve the conflict.
I agree with the resolution, albeit with these reservations.
Â Â  . Mr President, my colleagues have already referred to the fact that we have discussed this issue time and time again.
When it comes to human rights and the value of human dignity, we are dealing with variable geometry: when it is close to us, human life seems to matter, but when it is far away, we do not get our act together.
I have often driven in that part of the world.
I know that barren land; I know how those people live â or rather, survive â in those conditions, even when there is no conflict.
They are exposed to famine, shortages of food and a lack of drinking water.
You cannot imagine how hard their lives are.
Now, in their hundreds of thousands, they are being tortured, killed and the rest have fled their homes, and yet we will make another resolution here.
That proves how powerless the international community is in dealing with human suffering.
That is what it amounts to.
How many more conflicts do we need?
Even in the Balkans we did not get our act together until far too late.
And now Darfur is far too far away.
China and Russia are very cynically blocking our efforts in the United Nations.
Sudanâs rotten regime â I am sorry that I have to use non-diplomatic language â is blocking UN efforts, and we are powerless.
When we have international conflicts or problems, we need international governance.
Otherwise, future generations will say to us: âYou had the problem in your hand.
You saw the dark clouds on the horizon and you did nothingâ.
Â Â  . â I visited Darfur in September 2004 as part of a delegation from Parliament, and saw the extent of the tragedy, as Mrs Hall said earlier.
Afterwards, here in Parliament and in the EU, we supported the role that the African Union has sought to play in resolving the conflict. This has been dragging on for three years now, has caused over 200Â 000 deaths and has made 2 million displaced persons or refugees.
The United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) has gone as far as it can and the talks in Abuja are not making progress.
The conflict has worsened and is spreading to neighbouring Chad.
Jan Egeland was prevented from visiting Darfur â yet another snub by the Sudanese regime against the UN, not to mention the terrible war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated by its forces, including the Janjaweed militia.
The provocative threats by Khartoum to turn Darfur into a cemetery for UN troops should not intimidate.
The international community must not abdicate its responsibility to protect.
Consequently, it must send, without delay, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, a tough, well-equipped stabilising force, in so doing preparing the groundwork for a suitable-sized UN peace-keeping operation, both with a significant European contribution.
All Members of the United Nations Security Council must assume their responsibilities, including countries such as China that have protected the corrupt, criminal dictatorial regime in Khartoum.
Furthermore, there will only be a lasting solution to the conflict if there is an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the crimes of Darfur.
Accordingly, it is crucial to support the investigations of the International Criminal Court and to step up sanctions against Khartoum, strictly implementing the arms embargo and declaring an embargo on oil exports.
Â Â  . Mr President, my contacts in touch with those on the ground in southern Sudan inform me that there is a situation developing right now that deserves our urgent attention.
While the government in Khartoum claims to keep peace agreements, which we know it does not, it funds the LRAÂ â the Lordâs Resistance ArmyÂ â from northern Uganda to continue the genocide for them.
The LRA lay siege to southern Sudanese villages: killing the adults, taking the children.
Young girls are abducted to become sex and labour slaves and they are also sold, traded and given as gifts to the LRA arms dealers.
Young boys are terrorised into virtual slavery as guards and soldiers.
The LRA is only a small force, but it is increasingly expanding because abducted young boys are being used as combatants.
It is planting season now in southern Sudan.
Civilians should be planting but they cannot, because of the LRA threat, which is again backed by their own government.
If nothing is planted, famine will result.
The situation is critical, they need our protection now.
We have to ask ourselves: if Russia and China can support the government, why cannot we support the suffering Sudanese people?
Â Â  Mr President, we are once again discussing Darfur here in the European Parliament. It seems to be a sort of ânever-ending storyâ.
It is with sadness that we must admit that the Sudanese Government bears full responsibility for the fact that there is still fighting in this region.
The government in Khartoum respects neither the international agreements nor the authority of the United Nations, regarding the most recent UN peace mission as a return to colonialism.
It is worth noting, however, that the Sudanese Government only dares to behave in this way because it has not been isolated by the international community.
As the honourable speakers before me stated, countries such as Russia guarantee arms supplies to this country.
Let us call a spade a spade. What we are dealing with in Darfur is genocide, which should be unequivocally condemned by the UN.
It is highly inappropriate that some countries, such as Russia, are blocking the work of the UN Security Council in relation to this matter.
The European Parliament should exert pressure on international opinion so that Darfur may cease to be a symbol of violence and abuse.
Â Â  â Mr President, the war in Darfur, in the western part of the Sudan, has lasted since 2003, a devastating civil war that has resulted in the appalling toll of 200Â 000 dead and 3 million refugees, which observers describe as âRwanda in slow motionâ.
The European Union and the United States have expressed their support for the transfer of the mission from the African Union â whose 7Â 000 troops are quite unequal to the task â to troops provided by the UN.
The UNâs special emissary to Sudan, Jan Pronk, sums the situation up in bitter words, saying that the UN's efforts at peace in Darfur have ended in failure, and that too little has been done too late.
Some countries are treating the Sudan with kid gloves.
Even though the countries themselves differ, the reason is almost always the same: raw materials and crude oil.
Our resolution emphatically calls on the UN Security Council to meet to discuss the violence in Darfur and to do justice to its responsibility for the protection of civilians.
Â Â  Mr President, I think we should all be a little bit ashamed of ourselves because we are living in what we are calling a diplomatic society and civilisation, which is supposed to be one of the most advanced civilisations in the history of the world.
Yet we look on helplessly as victims â women, children, innocents â are being slaughtered.
We talk about it, we debate it, and we try and delude ourselves that the United Nations is doing something.
The United Nations cannot do anything.
We are realising that the United Nations, when faced with a regime that is prepared to do anything, whether involving nuclear arms in one country, or genocide or partial genocide of innocent people in another, cannot even visit the site where atrocities are taking place.
On the other hand, we are witnessing independent action being taken by the military of a country, as happened in Iraq.
And we are now calling for the Americans and the Europeans to save the innocent people in Darfur â and we are condemning the Americans at the same time for what has happened in Iraq, which was not the best of regimes.
I shall conclude by saying the situation is so grave that in my country, Malta, one third of the refugees â and we had a debate and vote on it during this part-session â come from Darfur.
That gives you one example of how desperate the situation is.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is extremely concerned by the situation in Darfur, which is the last open conflict on the African continent.
Periodic fighting continues to erupt between the belligerents and the civilian population.
In particular women and children are the first to suffer from this continued violence and the persistent lack of security.
Although the worst possible scenario has been contained by the prompt intervention of the African Union, the precarious status quo cannot continue much longer.
Almost three million people are depending on lifeline humanitarian aid, but access and security conditions for the humanitarian organisations are limited and hampered by continued violence, including direct attacks against relief operations.
The conflict is now spreading rapidly into neighbouring Chad and could jeopardise the fragile Sudanese conciliation process, initiated with the signature of the comprehensive peace agreement between Khartoum and the SPLM on 9 January 2005.
There is international consensus that the only way ahead is a political settlement in Darfur.
The Commission, Member States and the international community are very supportive of the African Unionâs objective to reach a rapid peace agreement in the talks in Abuja.
This could also facilitate a smooth transition of the current military responsibilities of the African Union in Darfur to the United Nations. An indispensable move, envisaged by the African Union itself, but still being opposed by Sudan.
The Commission believes that it is now high time for the parties, under the auspices of the African Union and with the support of the international community, to identify a roadmap to peace in Darfur and for the AU-UN transition with specific benchmarks and clearly assigned responsibilities.
These would allow the international community to use all means of diplomatic pressure, including sanctions, to force the progress of the whole process.
Nevertheless, to be sustainable a political conciliation in Darfur has also to be based on the provisions of justice and international support for the construction of the region.
In this context, it is important that Khartoum and the rebels contribute and assist the work of the International Criminal Court on Darfur and that the donor community is ready to provide an immediate peace dividend once a positive outcome emerges from Abuja.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Iraq: Assyrian community, situation in prisons in Iraq(1).
Â Â  . Mr President, the motion in front of you focuses on two key issues of human rights, where two particularly vulnerable groups are gravely at risk in modern-day Iraq.
The first issue is that of religious minorities, the second is that of prisoners.
Turning to the religious minorities, there have been extensive assaults recently on Christians and the concomitant lack of aid for the refugees who have fled â who happen to be Christians and Assyrians â into nearby Syria and Jordan.
Let me say immediately that religious persecution is non-Islamic.
The Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, declared that Christians would be the best friends of his followers, the Muslims.
In the Holy Koran there are clear statements of respect for other faiths.
Those who are carrying out these assaults are anarchists: they misuse the name of Islam for their anarchical aim to restore dictatorship with themselves in power.
What can we do?
We can urge, as we do in our strong and powerful resolution, the current government at all levels of Iraq to protect religious minorities and â in this resolution â most particularly the Assyrian Christians.
We in the European Union could provide support and call upon the international community to provide support for the refugees now numbering hundreds of thousands, I understand, in neighbouring countries such as Syria and Jordan.
I urge you to support this resolution.
On the second issue â that of prisonersâ rights â let us remind everyone that the rule of law demands respect for the law on the rights of prisoners.
That is something that all of the international community knows, as does the new Iraqi Government.
Let us demand, therefore, that the rights of political and other prisoners are fully respected and let the European Union support the establishment of the rule of law from top to bottom, a justice system to support the Iraqi-elected Government.
Â Â  . Mr President, since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, thousands of people have been arrested by foreign troops, mostly from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In many of these cases, no specific charges have even been brought and these people have been denied the legal and judicial guarantees appropriate under the rule of law.
According to various sources, around 15Â 000 people are still in US detention centres in Iraq and an unknown number of people are not contactable and their whereabouts unknown, even to the Red Cross, which is a clear and flagrant violation of international law.
They are what we sometimes call âphantom prisonersâ.
Furthermore, thousands of these people have been in this situation for more than a year.
Reports and evidence of torture, humiliation and abuse are not just increasing, but they are becoming increasingly frequent and alarming.
We must add to this the persecution of certain groups suffering as a result of their religious affiliations, as has been said, as I believe this Resolution stresses quite correctly.
Nevertheless, in addition to the Assyrians, who are especially mentioned in the Resolution, I believe that we should take account of other non-Muslim minority groups such as the Yazidi or the Turkmen, for example.
In any event, I would like to make two proposals which I believe to be fundamental, even though they are not taken up in the compromise Resolution itself.
Firstly, I would like to call upon the multinational forces and the Iraqi authorities to publish the names of the people being held, to guarantee them the necessary legal representation and to allow them family visits, as we also recently demanded in the case of GuantÃ¡namo.
Secondly, I believe that this House should call loud and clear for all of those people who have been accused of crimes under international law, such as torture and illegal detention, to be tried.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is closely related to the issues we are dealing with in the temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
Â Â  Mr President, speaking on behalf of the PSE Group I should like to say that we are all aware of the awful situation in Iraqâs prisons.
We all know about what happened in Abu Ghraib and elsewhere.
We very much support the resolution demanding the establishment of detention conditions that conform with international standards.
We will be voting in favour of the amendment that asks for the names to be revealed of those people who are held in prison and that they be allowed family visits.
We also urge the Iraqi Parliament to ratify the Convention against Torture.
I mainly want to speak on the issue of the Assyrians.
As someone who supports and is supported by the âSave the Assyrian Campaignâ, whose Honorary President is Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, I am well aware of the forgotten people of Iraq.
We hear talk about the Sunni, the Shia and the Kurds, but who has been talking about the 800Â 000 Assyrians that live in Iraq?
They make up 8% of the population, which would be considerably larger if it had not been for the fact that, because of persecution, many have fled to Jordan and Syria, where they live in terrible conditions.
We urge the Iraqi authorities to condemn all acts of violence against the Assyrians, the Chaldeans, the Syriacs and other Christian minorities in Iraq.
We urge the Iraqi authorities and the multinational force to find the perpetrators of the crimes against them, to facilitate the return and resettlement of the Assyrians in secure environments where their customs and way of life are respected, and urge the Constitutional Committee of the Iraqi Council of Representatives to preserve the cultural and religious rights of all Iraqi communities in its proposals for constitutional amendments.
Â Â  . â Mr President, according to the latest information, at least 14Â 000 prisoners are being held in Iraq without any definite charge being laid against them.
Amnesty International does not mince its words when it says that the occupying powers â the USA and the United Kingdom â are, by keeping them prisoner, directly violating international law and that they have failed to learn any lessons from Abu Ghraib.
There is no doubt about it; these prisons in Iraq are part of the policy of occupation.
It is the occupation of Iraq that is the real political problem, and we should not beat about the bush in saying so.
A whole array of EU Member States are, alas, directly involved in this occupation â the United Kingdom and Poland among them.
The EU itself has a hand in what is going on in Iraq in the shape â among other things â of the Eurojust-Lex programme, which, I believe, needs to be reviewed, since, if the present legal system is to be judged by the vast number of people in jail, the programme can hardly be effective in any real sense.
We must, then, demand in clear terms that the occupation of Iraq and the human rights violations in its prisons be brought to an end, and it is the European Parliament that must make that demand, and in very, very clear language.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I have to say at the very start that I think it a scandal that MrÂ PflÃŒger had nothing whatever to say about the plight of Christians in Iraq, although that is perhaps understandable if one is aware that his party still lives off the money of another state in which Christians were subject to great persecution, that state being the GDR.
I have to tell him, though, that there are many points on which I agree with him.
I was â and still am â a forthright critic of the intervention in Iraq, and I do believe that we have to very objectively assess what has resulted from it.
The main justification for this intervention adduced by those who sought to justify it was the need to improve the state of human rights under Saddam Husseinâs brutal regime.
There have indeed been some improvements, but we must, unfortunately, note that a number of things have also got worse.
First among these â and a major one â is the fact that the intervention caused the very complex ethnic balance in what was an artificial state created by the colonial powers after the First World War to be upset, and that nobody has any idea how to create a proper state in Iraq.
The hardest hit by all this are the less numerous peoples and particularly the small minorities such as the Assyrians and other small ethnic groupings.
I am very struck by the way in which so many in this House find it so difficult to stand up for the rights of Christians and to speak up in their defence.
Here is a minority that is being persecuted for its Christian faith.
Who shall plead their cause if not this Europe of ours, the inhabitants of which are 85% Christian?
We in this House must stand in solidarity with all those who are persecuted, with everyone whose human rights are violated, but there should be some sort of natural bond between the mainly Christian Europe and the ancient Christian minorities in this region, who have a very troubled history to look back on and who suffer in a particular way from the unstable conditions that prevail today.
They are persecuted for being Christian, and their persecutors are extremist elements that â as Lady Nicholson put it so very well â misuse Islam for political reasons in order to subjugate and enslave the minorities they do not like.
It is a politicised Islam that persecutes these minorities.
We have every right to be critical of the state of affairs in the prisons.
What must be plain to us is that, while we have overthrown a dictatorship, and are engaged in building up democracy and the rule of law â an objective I endorse and that needs masses of support from the EU â we must then be willing to be judged by appropriate standards.
The conditions under which prisoners are kept and the justice system are the first steps on the road to a functioning state under the rule of law, and this is particularly true of those prisons that are run by others rather than by the Iraqis themselves.
All things considered, one has to say that human rights are indivisible, and turning a blind eye is not an effective way for anybody to stand up for human rights.
Â Â  . Mr President, my party and I have always supported and still support the intervention in Iraq by Western democracies in defence of basic values and fundamental human rights.
From the standpoint of a supporter of the intervention in Iraq by the United States and other democratic powers, I have to say that it is with great concern and sadness that I receive news of indications of human rights infringements perpetrated by a government which was supposed to be democratic and which should have brought democracy to Iraq.
In fact, we find ourselves in an unfortunate situation if, after toppling Saddam Husseinâs dictatorship, we continue to witness human rights abuses in Iraq.
That is precisely why, although I do not agree with many of the speakers before me and disagree with the use of the term âinvasionâ to describe what happened in Iraq, in this case I have to admit that we should act together in this House and clearly demand that both the Western democracies and the new democratic government in Iraq should respect human rights. For it is only respect for human rights that will legitimise the actions that my country, irrespective of the government in power at the time, also supported.
I would also like to state very clearly that it is laudable that the House has found the strength to speak up in defence of a Christian minority.
We must also acknowledge that Christians are persecuted not only in Iraq but throughout the world and we, as Europeans, should come to the defence of the community which the honourable speaker before me mentioned.
In Europe today, and in the European Union in particular, the rights of minorities are guaranteed.
The rights of religious minorities, Muslims and all other minorities one could possibly imagine and which exist on our continent are also guaranteed.
It is the norm and forms part of the achievement that the European Union represents.
It also represents the current state of European civilisation.
This is precisely why we have the right to call for human rights for Christians.
Events taking place in Iraq affect, and this is particularly important, an ancient people from that region.
It is a people whose Christianity and ethnic roots, which are inextricably tied to Iraqi soil, are deeply embedded in history. It is not an immigrant people; they are not invaders.
They are the autochthonous inhabitants of those lands.
As is often the case in this House, this resolution represents a compromise enjoying cross-party support.
I hope that, in this resolution, we will be just as unequivocal in calling for the new Iraqi democratic government to respect human rights as in calling for the religious freedom of all inhabitants of Iraq to be guaranteed.
Â Â  . Mr President, over the last few months in Iraq, we have seen an increase in violence against religious minorities.
On the 29 January, for example, four churches and the Vatican embassy building in Baghdad, and two churches in Kirkuk, became the targets of attacks.
Three people, including a 14-year-old boy, were killed and many more were wounded.
This violence is directed against the Assyrian community in particular as well as against other Christian minorities.
The Assyrian community is descended from an ancient people who inhabited these lands and it is threatened with forced displacement.
As a result, world culture faces the disappearance of Assyrian culture in Iraq.
The most important issue related to the rebuilding of Iraq remains guaranteeing the rule of law.
The political situation bears many of the hallmarks of a civil war and it must not be allowed to deteriorate into a dirty war, where the forces of law and order constantly use torture, hostages are taken and lawlessness characterises the fight against rebel forces.
Iraq needs more judges, a professional police force and a penal system which meets international standards.
The Iraqi Human Rights Ministry and the EU Integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq Eurojust Lex should play a particularly important role in controlling this problem.
The European Union must now decide to extend the mandate of this mission with respect to the training of Iraqi forces of law and order and forensic medicine.
Â Â  . Mr President, ânearly three years after United States and allied forces invaded Iraq and toppled the government of Saddam Hussein, the human rights situation in the country remains direâ.
That is the introductory sentence to the most recent report by Amnesty International on detention and torture in Iraq.
Well-documented reports like that and many others make very grim reading indeed, recounting instances of arbitrary detention, widespread torture including brutal beatings, the breaking of bones, electric shocks, pulling nails out, hanging chained people from the ceiling, causing burns, rape and sexual humiliation, attacks by dogs, extrajudicial killings and many more.
Colleagues, these despicable crimes are not happening in evil Husseinâs prisons, but in US- and British-controlled and run prisons.
We rightly blamed Hussein for what was happening more than three years ago.
Must we not now blame Bush and Blair and hold responsible for the gross disrespect of human life and dignity occurring in prisons in Iraq today?
After all, we in the West must ensure that we set the highest standards and are not found guilty of the ill-treatment of fellow human beings whose lives are in our hands.
Â Â  . Mr President, for a long time, Iraq was subjected to a terrible regime, terrible for its opponents, prisoners, minorities, and even terrible for the large majority.
We are now learning from first-hand experience the answer to the question as to whether external intervention really can improve such a situation.
It may well have done so for a handful of groups, such as the Kurds in the north, who had brought about a factual split from Iraq a long time ago, and also the political opponents who had fled the country.
To most people, Iraq is not a state in which they share but rather a battlefield between external interests and the very divergent group interests of, and the opinions held by, Shiites, Sunnis, Kurds and the Christian minorities who predated the Islamic era, and who, unlike the other groups, do not have their own territory as a possible federal state in a federation.
Although we completely share Mr Posseltâs concerns about this group, nobody is able to offer a real solution under the current circumstances.
The foreign occupiers have let the prison system deteriorate further, have allowed the re-introduction of the death penalty and cannot offer a future to a large majority of the people.
Whilst the proposed resolution is right to identify a number of flaws, it is still far too optimistic and does not really contribute to a solution of the problems.
It is important to draw the lesson that military interventions do not solve anything.
Â Â  . Mr President, todayâs debate concerns the Assyrian community in Iraq and the problem of torture in Iraqi prisons.
Whereas individual soldiers belonging to the international forces occupying Iraq are convicted of infringing the human rights of prisoners, the increased violence against Christians comes from Islamic extremists.
They use blackmail and extortion, attack churches and carry out other acts of abuse which threaten the existence of the oldest Assyrian community in these lands, a community which speaks Chaldo-Aramaic.
Massacres of the Assyrian people are nothing new, as 33 of them have been recorded since the third century, but they have become increasingly frequent in recent times.
However, aggression and violence are not a way of solving the complex problems in this region.
Violence breeds violence, just as aggression breeds aggression.
The situation thus requires national dialogue, acceptance of religious differences and, as the resolution states, it requires the perpetrators of the violence to be identified and brought to justice.
It needs to be made easier for refugees to return home, and real aid also needs to be delivered to Iraqis to rebuild their country.
Violence is not a good or long-term solution to problems anywhere in the world.
This is why we appeal for respect for human rights and dignity.
Â Â  () Mr President, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that no one may be unlawfully detained and that imprisonment must be in keeping with the letter of the law.
That is what the legislation states, but what is the reality?
It is common knowledge that conditions in prisons in Iraq fall below all humanitarian and sanitary standards.
Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is used.
The American authorities boast that they investigate all reports of inappropriate treatment of prisoners.
The Pentagon states that, over the last few years, disciplinary action has been taken against 200 soldiers accused of inappropriate treatment of prisoners.
If we do want to plant the seeds of democracy in this country, we shall certainly not be able to do so while our representatives there become perpetrators instead of bringing aid.
Â Â  â The humanitarian disaster in Iraq is the result of the aggression perpetrated by the United States and the âcoalition of the willing'.
In case some of you are not aware to which countries this refers, the next in line are the United Kingdom and Poland, followed by a number of other countries.
Among other things, representatives from these countries have been training Iraqi policemen, and I am sure that they will have made use of this opportunity to urge the policemen to uphold international standards on treating prisoners.
I am also sure that the prisoners will have been informed under paragraph 9(b) of this resolution how to raise an objection in court effectively.
I believe that the other procedures to which the motion for a resolution correctly refers will also have been discussed with them.
Unfortunately, I have not yet seen policemen in Iraq protesting against the situation of prisoners or theÂ mistreatment of minorities.
We must therefore take a firm line on these issues and adopt this motion for a resolution, in its amended form.
It would therefore, in turn, be opportune for the criteria contained in the resolution to serve as the basis for the guidelines for future negotiations on aid for todayâs occupying force and the puppet regime.
I support the resolution.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are increasingly concerned about ethnic and religious violence and its possible escalation in Iraq.
Lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law in Iraq is a matter of grave concern for the international community.
All ethnic and religious communities of Iraq, including the Assyrians, have the right to protection and to practise their ethnic, religious, political, administrative and cultural rights.
The European Union supports the development of a secure, stable and democratic Iraq, with a parliament and a government, elected on the basis of a constitution that guarantees respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Iraqi population as a whole.
This is one of the key objectives for the European Union as laid down in the medium-term strategy of June 2004.
This objective is just as valid today as it was then.
The Commission emphasises the importance of effective protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and encourages the Iraqi Government to take appropriate action. This should also include the abolition of the death penalty which, to the strong disappointment of the European Union, was re-introduced by the Iraqi authorities in 2004.
We join the international community in expressing our deepest concern at the cases of alleged torture and ill-treatment of Iraqi prisoners.
We condemn any incidents of abuse of prisoners in Iraq, whether by Iraqi forces or by multinational forces, as contrary to international humanitarian law, and call for those responsible to be brought to justice.
We have noted that the UK, the US and Iraqi authorities have launched investigations into reports of such abuse and some of those responsible for torture and ill-treatment have already been sentenced.
We underline the obligations set out in the Geneva Conventions, that recourse to torture or inhuman treatment is a grave breach of those Conventions.
It is vital for Iraq and the international community to work together to reassert full respect for international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards.
The European Union is committed to actively supporting the stabilisation of Iraq.
The Commission and the European Union Member States are working together to strengthen the rule of law through an ESDP â European Security and Defence Policy â operation called EUJUST LEX.
It is an Integrated Rule of Law Mission providing training in EU Member States in the fields of management and criminal investigation for 770 senior officials and executive staff of the Iraqi judiciary, police and prisons.
An essential element of that operation is training on human rights.
In addition, we support the promotion of human rights, an important component of which deals with torture prevention and victim rehabilitation, and we support electoral processes and the constitutional process, working with the United Nations.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the case of Ayman Nour in Egypt.
Â Â  . Mr President, this powerful resolution calls Parliamentâs attention to the fate of a beleaguered parliamentarian, Al-Ghad opposition party leader Ayman Nour, and requests the Egyptian authorities to respect our views.
We in the European Union are rightly proud of our deep and profound relationship with Egypt.
Indeed, Egypt co-chairs the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and, with Egypt, we have defined a European Neighbourhood Policy, which strengthens political dialogue and integrates us with Egypt â as Egypt is within the Arab League â to promote peace and stability.
Egypt is instrumental in helping us in that task.
We bitterly regret, therefore, that after the recent presidential election and the parliamentary elections in Egypt in November and December last year, DrÂ Nour was arrested.
It is hard to believe that the charges for which he has been given fiveÂ yearsâ imprisonment could be true.
Ayman Nour has hundreds, nay, thousands of supporters.
It is very difficult to see why he would have bothered or needed to falsify some of the 50Â signatures needed to have his candidature be legally effective.
We are gravely disturbed at the deterioration of his health; deeply troubled that his appeal will be considered by a judge who be considered to have a major conflict of interest; and indeed we wish to remind the Government of Egypt, and the courts of Egypt, that human rights are a fundamental basis of the European Union-Egypt Partnership and Association Agreement, which we value so very highly.
Indeed, we want to stress that our view is well in line with the laws of Egypt itself and so we request the Egyptian Government to look at this again and to regulate the framework, so that opposition candidates can stand and perhaps even DrÂ Nourâs judge might be reconsidered.
Â Â  . Mr President, we need to realise that this is the third resolution dealing with human rights in Egypt and Dr Ayman Nourâs situation in particular.
Dr Ayman Nour was sentenced to five yearsâ imprisonment for the alleged crime of falsifying his political partyâs registration documents.
He came second in the last presidential elections and he remains in prison today where his health continues to deteriorate.
It is positive, after a fashion, that his case will be reviewed by the Court of Cassation on 18Â May 2006, but we must keep a watchful eye on this trial.
In recitalÂ I of the resolution we commit ourselves to an ad hoc delegation at least trying to see him in the event that the trial continues his incarceration.
It is clear, however â in the eyes of my group at least â that he should be released forthwith, because the crimes of which he is accused and indeed convicted do not appear to stack up in reality.
The Egyptian Government should be in no doubt that we will watch this case with interest.
Dr Ayman Nour is an example of a wider difficulty in Egypt with human rights in general, and it is in this connection that this resolution presents some concrete steps forward.
In paragraphs 7 and 8 of the resolution, which I would ask the Commissioner to comment on this afternoon, we call on the Commission to create a specific subcommittee on human rights in the framework of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement.
There is a human rights deficit in Egypt that must be addressed.
The creation of a specific committee to monitor and enforce the action plan will be a concrete way to give teeth to the warm words that this House too often produces.
Egypt is a valued partner of the EU and this House in the Middle East peace process, an ally in so much and a partner in development, but we must acknowledge that Egypt does not meet our standards.
We must pointedly, if necessary, use the Association Agreement to assist in the development and building-up of Egyptian civil society for the betterment of the Egyptian people and a more constructive degree of EU-Egyptian partnership.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that the most important point of this motion for a resolution is the last point but one, which states, âCalls on the Parliament of the Republic of Egypt to engage in a process of democratisation and of enforcement of the rule of law and human rights with a view to it playing a leading role in the region as aÂ future model of parliamentary democracyâ.
Egypt is fundamental in the Middle East, it is crucial in the Mediterranean and it is, and must continue to be, a privileged partner of the European Union.
For all of these reasons, however, there is no question that Egypt must be a democracy.
Unfortunately, cases such as that of MrÂ Nour show us that that is not yet the case.
I met MrÂ Nour at the first session of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, following its creation in March 2005, in Cairo.
Thanks to pressure from us, he was released.
I met with him, together with MrÂ McMillan-Scott and MrsÂ Flautre.
He is a democrat and, as far as I am concerned, he must be released, and there is nothing more to say.
That is what we want from the Court of Cassation which will meet in May, as a clear sign that Egypt is going to allow freedom of expression, of association and of thought and that everybody will be able to express their views freely during future elections.
Â Â  . Mr President, Egyptâs stability has, for a long time, been based on a single-party state.
In the post-Nasser era, this party no longer represents a common ideology, but merely the common interest which being in power involves.
It is possible these days for individual outsiders to take part in the elections outside of this monopoly of state power, provided that they do not constitute a threat to those established powers that be.
That is why opposing candidates constantly run the risk of being hounded, intimidated or locked up.
Above all, they are not given the chance to surround themselves with a soundly structured and permanent movement.
The state of emergency proclaimed in 1981 is still an important instrument for sustaining this situation.
This time round, it was Ayman Nour, ex-parliamentarian and former presidential candidate, who was its victim.
Due to Egyptâs contribution to the stability in the Middle East, particularly the peaceful co-existence with neighbour Israel since 1978, there is noticeably little criticism from Europe with regard to this situation.
Quite the reverse: the European Union seeks good relations with all states along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
My group wholeheartedly supports the demand for Egypt to become more democratic, to put an end to the state of emergency and no longer to obstruct opponents.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to insert a new paragraph 5a.
The text is as follows: 'calls for the liberation of DrÂ Ayman Nour'.
Mr President, this morning we had the Belarusian opposition leader, Mr Milinkevich, here.
He is free, but Ayman Nour is not free, although the two men are in a similar position in their respective countries.
MrÂ Milinkevich said that when he went to an election debate, he had to take his own drinking water with him.
Well, every human being has an in-built aspiration to drink the clean water of democracy; what Mr Milinkevich is doing in Belarus, AymanÂ Nour is trying to do in Egypt.
He tries to give Egyptian people hope.
He wants to give hope to those people who believe in a free tomorrow.
Egypt plays a crucial part, in many ways, in the Middle East.
If it does not show the way to democratisation for the rest of that region, its future will be condemned in advance.
Egypt plays an important part in terms of its relationship with the United States and its constructive approach to Israel, but if its relationship with the EU is to deepen, Egypt must take steps towards democracy.
Egyptian people deserve democracy.
Why is AymanÂ Nour in prison?
He is there because of flimsy charges; he is detained for nothing; he is detained because he dared to stand against PresidentÂ Mubarak.
If we want democracy to blossom in Egypt, we must ensure that DrÂ Ayman Nour is freed.
If he is freed, that will also free the democratic forces in that part of the world, which is also an issue concerning future stability in that part of the world.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the interest of the honourable Members of the European Parliament in the human rights issues in our neighbourhood, in particular in Egypt and in the case of Mr Ayman Nour.
The Commission has been following closely the trial of Mr Nour, the leader of Egyptâs opposition Al-Ghad Party, since his first arrest in February 2005.
As you will be aware, in reacting to the five-year sentence given to Mr Nour last December, the European Union stressed that the imprisonment sent a negative signal about democratic reform in Egypt.
In our opinion, the case should be seen in the context of the process of democratisation in Egypt, as well as being related to the independence of the judiciary.
The Commission expects the Court of Cassation to consider the case in accordance with the Egyptian judicial process and international legal standards.
The Commission is ready to engage in a political and human rights dialogue with Egypt, in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
The negotiations for the conclusion of an action plan are well advanced.
We are confident about making further progress in the coming weeks and we hope to finalise negotiations in the coming months.
In order to monitor the implementation of the action plan â and this should answer Mr Smithâs question â a structure of subcommittees will be created in the framework of the Association Agreement.
The subcommittees will deal with political and human rights reforms in Egypt.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debates, in other words in a moment.
Â Â  The next item is Voting Time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to propose an oral amendment to insert a new paragraphÂ 5a.
The text is as follows: '5a. Calls for the liberation of DrÂ Ayman Nour'.
This amendment has been approved by the main political parties.
That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 6 April 2006.
Â Â  I would like to inform you that at its meeting of 6 April the Conference of Presidents accepted the request of the Delegation for Relations with Iran to change its name to the Delegation for Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.
If we accept this proposal, we are effectively amending one of Parliamentâs resolutions, the resolution giving names to the delegations for relations with third countries.
What we therefore need is for nobody to oppose it.
If nobody is opposed, the name of that delegation will be changed as I indicated.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to express my total opposition to this about-turn, which amounts to a pathetic surrender to the demands of the new President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
There is absolutely no justification for this act, which is totally out of step with Parliament's tradition.
I therefore protest and wish to register my vehement objection to your decision.
Â Â  Does anybody else wish to speak?
Although really, one speaker is enoughÂ âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, we must respect the principles of each country.
Irrespective of whether this country is friendly, less friendly or more friendly, this country has decided on a name.
We cannot but respect the name of this country.
The rest â as I think everyone understands â is not democratic; it is blatant intervention in the internal affairs of a country.
We have to respect whatever this country wishes to call itself.
Â Â  We are not going to open up the debate now, since it would go on forever and it has already been held in the proper place; it is now simply a case of accepting or rejecting the proposal of the Conference of Presidents.
Since opposition has been expressed, we shall vote on it, but not now: the Members need to be made aware that a vote is to take place.
The change to the name of this delegation will therefore be put to the vote in plenary tomorrow at 11.00 a.m., during Voting Time.
Â Â  In addition to the amendment that was introduced a moment ago adding another item to be voted on tomorrow at 11.00 a.m. and which obviously changes the order of business, there are other amendments that I shall now explain.
A corrigendum relating to the agenda for today and tomorrow has been distributed; this corrigendum has included the changes that were decided upon in Strasbourg on Thursday 6 April.
It also includes the following amendments which I shall propose to the House with the support of the political groups:
Firstly, following the oral question on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, we shall have the Council and Commission statements on the suspension of aid to the Palestinian Authority.
Nevertheless, despite what the corrigendum that I have mentioned says, there will be no resolution at the end of this debate.
The corrigendum says that there will, but there will not: there will be no resolution following this debate.
With regard to the report by MrÂ Mavrommatis on promoting multilingualism and language learning in the European Union, which was scheduled to be the penultimate item on this eveningâs agenda, we shall postpone it until tomorrow morning, as the second and last debate to take place before the votes.
Finally, another correction is that, despite what was announced on 6Â April in Strasbourg, the sitting tomorrow Thursday will begin at 9.00 a.m. rather than 8.30 a.m.
I note the horror with which the Members have received that news, but I hope that you will get over your distress.
With regard to the votes for tomorrow Thursday, the vote on the report by MrÂ GauzÃšs on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil and commercial matters is being postponed, with a view to trying to reach an agreement at first reading.
Furthermore, we shall add two reports, pursuant to RuleÂ 131 of the Rules of Procedure: the report by MrÂ BÃ¶ge on the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund (A6-0138/2006), and the report by MrÂ Pittella on the draft amending budget No 1/2006, relating to the floods in Bulgaria, Romania and Austria.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  MrÂ President, I confess that there is one thing that I have not really understood.
With regard to the resolution on Palestine: who decided what, and when?
I would just like to know who it is that decides: was the decision taken by the secretaries-general of the political groups, by the Conference of Presidents, by an old folksâ meeting or by goodness knows who else?
I would simply like to be told who decided what, and when.
Â Â  As you know, the decisions are taken by the Conference of Presidents or, failing that, the meeting of the secretaries-general of the political groups.
The Presidencyâs services tell me that this decision was taken by the meeting of secretaries-general of the political groups yesterday at mid-day.
Â Â  MrÂ President, please forgive me, but I must be a bit simple-minded.
The Conference of Presidents is composed of elected representatives, the chairmen of the groups, who can make decisions: that is all well and good.
As far as I am aware, apart from the Conference of Presidents, it is the plenary that can make a decision.
The secretaries-general of the political groups, for their part, can voice their opinions but, given that they are not elected representatives and are not able to represent a group, they cannot make decisions.
That is the simple way I see things.
They can obviously submit proposals, but they cannot make decisions.
Â Â  Mr Cohn-Bendit, your mind is no simpler than the average mind in this Parliament and what you are proposing or suggesting must be taken into account.
It is assumed that the secretaries-general of the political groups attend the meetings of the political groups to communicate the opinion of the political groups.
We could now carry out a test to assess how representative the secretaries-general of the political groups are by putting the amendment to the agenda to a vote, but is that strictly necessary?
We shall seeÂ ...
Â Â  MrÂ President, I understand MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs spontaneous reaction, and I should therefore like to try to provide him with an explanation.
It was my group that asked for an item concerning the suspension of European Union aid to Palestine to be included on the agenda.
We submitted this proposal a long time after the last Conference of Presidents and, as a result, it was technically impossible for the Conference of Presidents to debate it.
That is why the secretaries-general consulted each other, as is customary.
I therefore understood our Presidentâs proposal in the following terms: it is now a matter of submitting to plenary the conclusions reached by the secretaries-general of the groups on the basis of our proposal and, if there is any opposition, we shall have to vote.
That being said, I thought that there was practically a consensus on supporting our proposal, the only difference being that we, for our part, were also in favour of submitting a resolution.
We shall not make a out of this matter, though.
Â Â  â Mr President, the decision under discussion â about which MrÂ Wurtz has said everything that needed to be said â was taken because we wanted a debate, but we also, considering among other things MrÂ Abbasâ forthcoming visit here in Brussels or in Strasbourg, said that it is not proper for us, here today and considering a subject like this, which can potentially have such a great political impact, to come to decisions and put them in the form of a resolution, and that is why we will not be supporting this motion, perfectly plain though it is that the motion is a legitimate one to put to this plenary, which is the highest authority in this House.
On this point I wholeheartedly endorse the line taken by MrÂ Cohn-Bendit.
I would, though, like to impart to the House something that Mr Cohn-Bendit did not say.
The Conference of Presidents is composed of ordinary Members â that is true, and Mr Cohn-Bendit is one of them â and the same Mr Cohn-Bendit, in the Conference of Presidents, welcomes the support of other group chairmen whenever they endorse his schemes â even when they are things that would not be likely to get a majority if voted on in this plenary.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is a fact that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is in the comfortable position of having two chairpersons, one of them being MrsÂ Frassoni, and the other MrÂ Cohn-Bendit.
I am always glad to see them, although I regret that I never see them together.
As MrÂ Wurtz and MrÂ Schulz have said, we agreed that there is a need for a bit of goodwill in this House, that we would debate this issue, but â things being as they are â would not draft a resolution, and that was what everyone agreed to.
This House is of course entitled to take the final decision â that goes without saying â but the decision taken in this instance by the Conference of Presidents â whose members are mere mortals, and so not everything we do is right â was a right and proper one, and I would appreciate it if the House were to act in accordance with it.
Â Â  Clearly, MrÂ President, I do not understand a thing.
MrÂ Wurtz stated that the proposal had been made well after the Conference of Presidents.
If MrÂ Wurtz is right, then the Conference of Presidents, which took place beforehand, was unable to examine the proposal, and that seems logical to me.
The person who made the proposal is the chairman of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
He just told us and you and I both heard him that he made the proposal after the Conference of Presidents.
Given that the proposal was made after the Conference of Presidents, that Conference, which took place beforehand, was unable to debate it.
That argument seems unanswerable to me.
Secondly, I will be very clear: if the two main groups are against a resolution being submitted, then there will be no resolution.
I would, however, like a vote to be held in this Chamber in order to decide whether or not there will be a resolution.
You have your arguments, and they are genuine; I, for my part, have other arguments that are just as genuine.
The majority will decide. That is democracy, thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, there seem to be many different recollections but it is certainly my recollection that we agreed in the Conference of Presidents that there would not be a resolution.
However, I rise to ask you to put an end to this and allow us to get on with our business this afternoon, either by requesting a vote in the House to proceed with the agenda as proposed, or by simply going ahead.
Â Â  Having consulted the Presidencyâs services, I am told that this item was incorporated, or its incorporation was proposed, after the last Conference of Presidents.
It has been proposed afterwards, and the proposal is to incorporate it without a resolution.
Since it has not been accepted by everybody, it must of course be put to the vote.
I do not want you to waste any more intellectual effort trying to understand what has happened, so please just say whether or not you agree that the agenda should be amended to include an item on the suspension of aid to the Palestinian Authority which will not be followed by a resolution.
The agenda will therefore include an item relating to a statement by the Council and the Commission on the suspension of aid to the Palestinian Authority, which will not be followed by a vote on a resolution.
I must also inform you that the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance will take place following the oral question to the Council on the modification of the Protocol on privileges and immunities.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission statement â Twenty years after Chernobyl: lessons for the future.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to the lives lost and the communities hurt in the Chernobyl devastation.
We know from the Latvian press that many people are still suffering the consequences, even now.
Latvia was not directly affected, but we have 6000 liquidators.
Today half of them are invalids and 500 are dead.
My personal contact with Chernobyl was very close.
On the day of the accident I was kayaking in Ukraine and I heard about it only two days later when one of the locals asked me whether I had heard about the accident at the nuclear power station nearby.
My second contact with it was through my brother-in-law, an ordinary man who was called to liquidate the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.
On the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident, the European Commission joins the European Parliament in a thorough reflection on the consequences of the accident and, in particular, on the lessons learned.
Firstly, since 1991, the European Union has provided important financial assistance to improve nuclear safety in Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Kazakhstan, including the consequences at the Chernobyl site itself.
To Ukraine alone, the Community has provided more than half a billion euros in assistance to projects relating to nuclear safety, including assistance to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
As a measure of continued EU commitment, the Commission has also proposed an instrument for nuclear safety to reinforce it outside the European Union borders for the period 2007-2013, with a proposed budget of EURÂ 500Â million.
For the international community, the Chernobyl accident represented a turning point, raising awareness of the need for rules and common standards to reduce the risk of an accident to a minimum, as well as preparation for immediate reaction in case of a radiological emergency.
A number of international conventions signed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency reflect the response of the international community in the wake of the accident: the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident; the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency; the Convention on Nuclear Safety; the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material; and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.
The European Atomic Energy Community and the Member States are contracting parties to all these conventions.
At European level, I would recall that the chapter in the Euratom Treaty on health and safety provides both for the protection of the health of workers and of the general public against the dangers arising from radiation.
The Treaty also obliges Member States and operators to supply the Commission with regular information on installations and nuclear material in their possession.
In addition, secondary legislation reflects the lessons learnt from the Chernobyl tragedy.
This includes foodstuffs legislation: soon after the accident, restrictions on certain agricultural imports were adopted and some border controls still apply today.
If ever needed, a Community mechanism will allow prompt fixing of the maximum permitted levels of contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.
Secondly, there is secondary legislation on emergency planning: there is an obligation that the necessary emergency plans must be drawn up at a national and local level, including inside the facilities, and emergency teams must be in place.
Member States must cooperate in emergency planning and in responding to an emergency.
Thirdly, there is secondary legislation on information in cases of radiological emergency: a Community system is in place for the early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency.
All Member States, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey participate in that mechanism.
Furthermore, all Member States have established on their territory a network of facilities for monitoring the levels of radioactivity in the environment.
It was such equipment in the Nordic countries that detected the Chernobyl accident well before it was revealed by the authorities of the Soviet Union.
Informing the population covers advance information to people living close to nuclear installations, as well as protection mechanisms to be provided to the population actually affected by such an emergency.
The European Union has provided financial support for the upgrading of the operating conditions of a number of nuclear installations within the European Union.
The reactors where sufficient upgrading could not be carried out will be or have been closed down.
The staged closure of the remaining reactors in Ignalina, Bohunice and Kozloduy was agreed in the negotiations for accession to the European Union.
They will be closed and we will provide financial support for the countries concerned.
Since 1986, the European Union has made significant progress particularly in the fields of safety, radiation protection and emergency preparedness.
The Commission would like to thank Parliament yet again for its support of the EU role in nuclear safeguards, as expressed in the resolution of 15Â March 2006 on the Lisbon Strategy.
This resolution recalls that the EU possesses globally acknowledged expertise in the area of nuclear energy and notes that this expertise relates, inter alia, to the efficiency and quality of production installations and to decommissioning processes.
It is also worth recalling that the Council in June 2004 set up a working party on nuclear safety, which is due to produce a final report at the end of this year.
Parliament is also aware that the Commission has made specific legislative proposals intended to provide the Union with common rules on nuclear safety, safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, and decommissioning funds.
Furthermore, the Commission will make every effort in the area of research and development to help to find a sustainable solution to the issue of the radioactive waste.
Once again, I wish to thank Parliament for its support and I thank you very much for your attention.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the accident that occurred exactly twenty years ago in the western part of what was then the Soviet Union was the first European environmental disaster to have an impact on the whole of the continent, and one of our responsibilities today is to ensure that it remains the only one.
We are, on a day such as this, profoundly touched by the fates of the victims of this tragedy and their families, of the workers at the power station and the rescue workers who sacrificed their lives in order to save the population from something worse, of those who lived in the immediate vicinity and those who were later to be, directly or indirectly, the victims of the nuclear fallout, among them many children, who were particularly hard hit by the effects.
An area of some 40Â 000 square kilometres, corresponding approximately to the territory of Belgium, is so heavily contaminated by radiation that it will, for decades to come, be uninhabitable and incapable of being used for agricultural purposes.
I have just been reminded that the explosion in this nuclear power plant occurred, not when it was being used for civilian purposes, but while military experiments were being carried on there.
For us, today, who have to discuss how dictatorships handle nuclear energy, the name of Chernobyl must be a warning.
It still, alas, needs to be said today that the attitude of those who were in positions of responsibility at that time in the Soviet Union towards the people in the affected towns and villages around the stricken reactor was very largely one of contempt.
Over the past twenty years, a great deal has been done in every quarter of the world to help those affected by the disaster and to support people who have to deal with its after-effects.
The innumerable associations and institutions that have done such splendid work in this field deserve our gratitude.
The sufferings of the victims and the dedication shown by many people in the European Union make it quite improper that that anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster should be used for political ends and as the occasion of a debate on the evils of atomic energy as such.
What is of fundamental importance is that nuclear safety be improved and guaranteed.
The power station at Chernobyl was shut down in December 2000; the decision to do so was welcomed in this House and by the European Union as a major contribution to improved nuclear safety in Europe and I would remind Commissioner Piebalgs of our consistent record of very good cooperation with the Commission.
The European Union has also played a substantial part in making safe the site of the accident at Chernobyl.
December 1997 saw the setting-up of a fund for the sheltering of the Chernobyl reactor, the intention being that the population and the environment would be protected from further radioactive contamination.
Both the collapse of the Iron Curtain and â in particular â the eastward enlargement of the European Union two years ago helped to make the use of atomic power in Europe safer.
Whereas, as recently as 2001, nine nuclear power stations with a total of 27 blocks of similar design to Chernobyl were connected up to the network, the new Member States, in the accession treaties, undertook to decommission them over the years to come.
It is very important that the compromise on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective be used to help make funds for the decommissioning of these sites available as quickly as possible.
Rather than now leaving to their own devices those accession countries that have to cope with the problems arising from the Chernobyl disaster, we must act in a spirit of solidarity with them, and in so doing we will be doing something for ourselves.
Over the years, a high standard of safety for atomic power plant has been established within the European Union, and it is now time for our neighbours to share in it, while we, at the same time, must further promote research into reactor safety, to which the research framework programme currently being considered by this House can make an important contribution.
This is a policy that we want to pursue and we very much hope that we will be able to guarantee security of energy supply without interfering with sustainable development or the well-being of the environment.
Whatever the safety requirements, then â and they are absolutely justified â the peaceful use of atomic power has to be considered in the context of the security of Europeâs supplies, and it is with that in mind that we must all work together.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is, for various reasons, very difficult to remember the victims of this accident on an anniversary like this one.
The suffering of these people cannot be measured.
I myself, when I was the mayor of a German town, had the opportunity to look after the children of families that had been victims of the contamination of Chernobyl, and it was one of the most bitter experiences of my political life.
The cynicism of those who bore responsibility for what happened defies description, and I agree with MrÂ Poetteringâs view that, if we are to remember what happened on this day twenty years ago, we have to remember that this was the result of an accident in a dictatorship.
The suppression of facts and the evasion and denial of responsibility caused time to be lost, time that was needed if action was to be taken at once to reduce the suffering of human beings.
If, then, today, you remember the victims, you must also recall who was responsible and be clear in your own mind about how great, how historic, that responsibility is.
I do not, however, share Mr Poetteringâs view that this recollection should not be used as the occasion for some fundamental decision-making about how atomic power is used.
As in all groups in this House â no, sorry, except perhaps for the Greens â there are differences of opinion within my own group.
There are party colleagues of mine who take a different view from my own, but every single one of us must, in the aftermath of Chernobyl, answer the question of which it has furnished an example and which it has made visible to every single human being, namely the question as to whether that which is technically possible is, in fact, morally defensible.
As I see it, the answer has already been given, and it is in the negative.
I believe that there are three fundamental reasons for scepticism about atomic energy.
Firstly, it can be argued that accidents in atomic power stations are rare; indeed they are, but, when they occur, they are so devastating in their effects that one must, considering the minor risk that may be present against the disaster that it equally well may entail, decide that the slight risk is not worth it.
I do not believe that that is a matter of doubt.
There is another reason.
Only in recent weeks, we have seen in India an example of what we are discussing with relation to Iran, namely that the misuse of civilian use for military purposes is nothing new, but rather something that has been going on for decades.
The International Atomic Energy Agency never had any jurisdiction over military use, but nor was it ever able to prevent the ban on proliferation being circumvented by civilian installations being built and then used for military purposes.
The risk of that is too great.
Thirdly, it is precisely because of the seamless transition from one use to another that the United States of America has, by its misconduct, given rise to yet another example.
The basis on which war with Iraq was embarked on was a questionable argument of âwe do not negotiate with dictators like Saddam who want to acquire weapons of mass destructionâ, yet, at the same time, negotiations were in progress with a dictator â one in North Korea â who actually did possess nuclear weapons, so the message sent out was: âwe will not attack you if you have nuclear weapons, but we will if you do notâ.
That amounted to an invitation to every dictator on the planet to get his hands on illegal nuclear weapons as quickly as possible.
That, too, must be considered when we discuss Chernobyl.
Ever since my earliest youth, I have campaigned in my own country against nuclear power.
The fact that the experience did not turn me into a Green is, I would say, a happy circumstance for the Greens, but there are many in my political family who think as I do; there are others who do not, and I want to speak out clearly on their behalf too; I have to appreciate their arguments and put them forward too.
There are members of my group who, like Mr Poettering, believe that this is a risk that may be taken, and I must have respect for them as well.
There is, though, one thing I would like to add: it is that it is an unfortunate fact that we all find a certain cynicism inescapable.
Opponents of the use of nuclear energy know that there are those who are in favour of it and that there are those who can make its use a reality.
A new nuclear reactor is currently under construction in Finland.
There are states around the world that are only now beginning to make civilian use of nuclear power, and it is because the risks are so great that those, too, who are opposed to nuclear energy as a matter of principle have an interest in our investing as much money as possible in the highest possible safety standards for it.
That may be cynical, but it is a kind of cynicism that we, twenty years on from Chernobyl, have to put up with.
Â Â  . Mr President, at 1.23 a.m. on 26 April 1986 an alarm sounded that signalled the worldâs worst ever civil nuclear accident.
The explosion at the Chernobyl power plant spewed radioactive waste over vast swathes of the former USSR and Western Europe, and rendered an area with a radius of 30 km uninhabitable to humankind.
It is fitting that we express today our solidarity with the victims of that accident and that we recognise the serious impact that it had on so many lives.
Official UN figures predicted up to 9Â 000 cancer-related deaths as a result of that accident.
However, a Greenpeace report released last week estimated 93Â 000, which could rise to around 200Â 000 if we include other related illnesses.
I want to speak, however, of the future, not of the past.
Chernobyl remains a symbol of the perils of nuclear fuel and the reason why we must work with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe that have nuclear reactors based on the same design, to render those as safe as possible while they must function, and take them out of commission as soon as we can.
I particularly welcome the Commissionerâs commitment to the development of renewable technologies.
The Commissioner will shortly be visiting my constituency, where we are closing nuclear power plants and developing renewable fuels.
With finite resources fast depleting, Europe will have to radically re-examine its patterns of energy supply and consumption.
This is especially true at a time of chronic instability in the Middle East, of alarming hikes in the price of crude oil, and increased competition for resources.
If we are to avoid being 90% dependent on Russian oil by 2020, we have to achieve greater autonomy in energy supply and develop a common energy policy with an intelligent, balanced energy mix.
Money invested in clean green technology is not money wasted and if Europe can lead the world in researching green technologies it will create more jobs, revive manufacturing, and generate greater export potential for our products.
That is why my Group applauds the Council and the Austrian Presidency for backing plans to double the use of biomass, including organic waste, for energy purposes, allowing us to cut energy imports by over 6% and bring up to 300Â 000 jobs to rural areas
With overall consumption rising, greater energy efficiency combined with the renewables could generate around 25% of our needs.
We have got to increase that figure, we have got to make a genuine commitment to investment in technologies for the future.
Investing in projects such as hydrogen fuel might have the potential to achieve oil savings equivalent to 13% of global oil demand.
Given the substantial contribution that nuclear power already makes to our energy autonomy, there must be renewed momentum to invest in safety, both to ensure that nuclear power stations produce less waste and present less risk and to develop Europeâs research into fusion energy through the Euratom framework and the experiment in Cadarache in France.
Lenin believed that progress could be achieved only through socialism and electricity.
History has judged him wrong on the first count but perhaps not on the second.
Nobody denies that we need a sustainable and secure energy supply; they disagree only on the mix.
The anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster is a reminder of the challenges we face in delivering our energy requirements while minimising the risks.
We owe it to the victims of Chernobyl to develop safe, reliable and sustainable sources of energy.
Â Â  . Mr President, today is a day of remembrance.
We should remember the thousands of people who have died and will die and the hundreds of thousands of people who suffer as a result of the accident at Chernobyl.
Despite 20 years having passed, citizens and policy-makers are not well-informed about the extensive consequences of the disaster.
The nuclear lobby stated last week in that only 50 people died as a result of Chernobyl.
The International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna spoke about 4000 deaths up to the beginning of last week, and had to revise this figure upwards under pressure from new independent studies, one of these commissioned by our colleague Mrs Harms.
What are the political lessons to be learnt from Chernobyl?
First of all, we need more dignity.
Victims of Chernobyl have faced considerable difficulty in getting recognition.
The victims deserve dignity.
They should not have to fight constantly against those who seek to suppress or to deny their suffering.
Secondly, we need absolute transparency â â on the real consequences of the accident.
The International Atomic Energy Agency, a UN pro-nuclear biased agency, must no longer be allowed to interfere and suppress studies from the World Health Organisation on the health impact of radiation.
We therefore have to end the 1959 agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organisation as provide in Article 12 of that agreement.
The same is true for Euratom â and I thank Mr RÃŒbig of the PPE-DE Group who, in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, has taken the initiative of raising the issue of putting an end to Euratom.
This agency cannot be a pro-nuclear agency and be independent on related health issues.
Thirdly, we need absolute transparency on the plans of the nuclear industry.
Today 450 nuclear reactors produce 2.5% of world energy and 6% of European energy demands.
If nuclear energy is the answer to security supply and to climate change, that percentage would need to rise from 2.5 to 30, 40, 50 or 60% of the mix.
We are not speaking about one reactor here and one reactor there. We are speaking about 4000, 5000, 6000 or 7000 reactors.
That is what the nuclear industry wants because we do not have plutonium.
That means fast breeders, enrichment, retreatment.
Do we want this risk to be taken in a world where accidents in the nuclear chain cannot be excluded, where al-Qaâida and other terrorists lie in wait, where proliferation is revealed in the Iran crisis?
Societies must learn.
Societies survive only if they learn the lessons from history.
Now is the time for decision.
Â Â  . Mr President, twenty years have passed since the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.
Even today, 20 years after the event, we can see the appalling consequences.
We can see these consequences in the form of the illnesses and disablement of thousands of people.
We can see them in the form of enormous areas of land that are uninhabitable and that will be so for many generations to come.
Even in my own little corner of Europe, in the north of Sweden, the radioactive fallout had an impact over many years through the contamination of the natural world that it caused.
The Chernobyl disaster is the worst nuclear accident that we have had, but we must not forget that it is not the only one.
Do not forget Three Mile Island and all the other near-accidents that have occurred in the history of the nuclear industry.
Nuclear power is not safe.
Over the last 20 years there have been very few new nuclear reactors built in Europe. This means that we have a lot of aged reactors that continue to be in full operation.
Aged reactors are dangerous reactors.
It is time to plan seriously to decommission these older nuclear reactors.
The Chernobyl disaster is a reminder of the risks of nuclear power.
To this should be added the fact that the issue of nuclear waste has still not been resolved.
We are today producing nuclear waste that we still do not know how we are to store.
We are leaving it up to future generations.
Nuclear power has also proved to be a very expensive source of energy.
This does not just mean that production costs are high but also that there are very high costs for dealing with retired reactors and the waste that is produced.
Last but not least, nuclear power is a finite resource.
The fuel will run out one day.
We are currently on the brink of an enormous changeâover of energy sources.
It is absolutely imperative that we phase out our dependence on oil and fossil fuels.
The primary reason for this is not the price of oil but the greenhouse effect.
It would be a fateful mistake to replace dependence on oil with a new and even greater dependence on nuclear power.
Instead of this, we have before us a unique opportunity to develop durable, renewable âgreen alternativesâ.
We also need to dramatically reduce our dependence on energy.
This is the conviction of the majority of the left in Europe.
The EU must, however, play its part in all of this.
More of the EUâs research money needs, then, to be spent on sources of renewable energy, and less on research into nuclear power, and the current EURATOM Treaty, which has been outdated for a number of years, needs to be repealed.
Only when we have abolished nuclear power will the risks of new Chernobyl disasters be done away with.
Â Â  â Mr President, today we remember the accursed day of the Chernobyl accident.
We still do not know how many people died.
We do not know how many people we need to remember today.
Some talk of 4Â 000, Greenpeace talks of 93Â 000 and we still do not know what the exact figure will ultimately be.
People are still dying.
Caesium has an active cycle of 35 years.
Twenty years have gone by, meaning that cancer will be lodged in the human body for another 15 years.
Deaths from thyroid cancer have multiplied a hundredfold.
There have been a great many deaths from leukaemia and this evil will not stop and will continue for a great many years.
They are already preparing a new 'frame' to cover Chernobyl.
At some point they have poured 200 metres of concrete and there are still leaks.
So they are going to make a steel cover that will cost several billion euros, in a country in which pensions have been a mere EUR 20 a month for the last 100 years.
The fatal radioactive materials will be there for 100Â 000 years.
So that you understand how long we are talking about, Christ died just 2Â 000 years ago and Noah's flood was just 5Â 000 years ago.
So just imagine how many thousands of years it will be active.
What conclusion do we need to draw?
That this is very, very dangerous yet, at the same time, the number of nuclear stations is multiplying.
The Commissioner said that Bulgaria has promised to close Kozludy.
Yes, this is a promise, but he did not tell us that Bulgaria is already building another nuclear station a few kilometres away, just 50 kilometres from the second largest city in Greece and less than 1Â 000 kilometres from Rome as the crow flies.
If, therefore, a similar incident occurs, you understand what damage and how many deaths we shall have in Europe.
All of us here â in one of the biggest parliaments in the world â must find the courage and vote and talk and argue against nuclear power.
We must call for nuclear disarmament.
Turkey is already building three nuclear stations and I do not want to say that Turkish and Bulgarian engineers are more inferior to Soviet engineers who, if nothing else, were the first in this field and still suffered the accident.
However, if some terrorist were to launch a missile at such a station, do you understand what the damage would be?
The probable damage is huge compared to the economic benefit that nuclear stations can bring to the energy problem.
We need to weigh up the evil and take important initiatives.
I must also report the following sad fact: this year Greece does not have enough soldiers.
Do you know why?
Because there were 3Â 500 miscarriages immediately after Chernobyl and we lost a lot of children who could have been in the army today.
We must therefore pay very careful attention to our future, to the future of our children and to the future of the next generations.
Democracy needs courage.
Â Â  . Mr President, in speaking today it is very difficult to know what words can fully express the horrors which still befall the people of Chernobyl, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other parts of Europe because of the results of this accident.
I was particularly moved by what Commissioner Piebalgs said in his opening statement about the people who went in immediately after the accident to do the clean-up work, to try to put concrete into the sarcophagus, and to try to protect the rest of the population.
Those people are forgotten today in our discussions.
They gave their lives knowing that it was a suicide mission but, for fellow mankind and for the greater good of their countrymen and countrywomen, they took that action and took that dangerous task on board.
Today when we speak about Chernobyl and the nuclear industry, the two go hand in hand.
Despite what people may say about advances in technology or the new safety measures that have been put in place, the risks associated with nuclear energy are so vast and so great.
The waste product has an active life of thousands of years that we can neither control nor manage.
Before World War II, a famous American general made this comment about possible atomic weapons: âAtomic weapons are to an army what an elephant is to a mouse.
If we can control them and use them for our good, it is a great thing; but by scale and virtue of size it is impossible for a mouse to control what an elephant will doâ.
Likewise, I believe it is impossible for mankind to control what nuclear energy will do.
The best option we have is to forego the nuclear option and look at alternatives, as other people have mentioned.
To move away from that argument back to today: when we think of the lessons of 20Â years, in Ukraine and Belarus and in other parts of Europe there are still children being born with birth defects.
There is a cardiac condition known as Chernobyl heart, where young children who should be full of health and full of life suffer severe heart attacks and strokes because of the impact of radiation and the fallout they have in their own systems.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s a voluntary group called the Chernobyl Childrenâs Project was set up in Ireland by one woman who saw the horrors of Chernobyl.
Since then, every summer, 14Â 000 children have been brought from Chernobyl to Ireland for a three-week break in a clean environment, to get fresh air, to live with host families, to know what it is like to live in a proper family environment, and to get medical and dental treatment.
Over that period of time, that voluntary group has raised over EURÂ 60Â million for humanitarian and medical aid for Chernobyl and Belarus.
There are many other small projects like that, which are run by individuals who saw the need.
I shall end with this short quote.
Dostoyevsky said: âNo world event is worth the shedding of one childâs tearâ.
Just think of all the tears that have been shed by children and by families because of Chernobyl.
It is our responsibility to ensure that it cannot happen again.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even 20 years on, our minds still conjure up the horrors of the Chernobyl disaster; once again we see the incandescent gullet of the nuclear plant; once again we see the thousands of human lives snuffed out; once again we see children contaminated with huge doses of radiation.
What is more, we read with alarm about the number of people who, as a result of Chernobyl, still die before their time.
I was two months pregnant 20 years ago.
As has been well-documented, my country, the then Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, did not escape the nuclear fallout.
I would not want anybody to go through pregnancy with the gnawing, agonising fear of whether the child will be born healthy or a victim of the human errors, the propaganda lies and the arrogance of the regime.
I am pleased that the EU has invested hundreds of millions of euros into softening the impact of the nuclear disaster and I believe that it is in the interests of every citizen of the EU-25 to contribute towards the new safe sarcophagus over the Chernobyl plant and towards gradually getting life back on track in the area around Chernobyl, within the realms of what is feasible.
I travel to Ukraine and I see the endeavours of the people in this area.
Ladies and gentlemen, despite all the horrors and fear that the word Chernobyl arouses to this day, I believe that we must admit that the EU cannot do without nuclear energy.
As we are all aware, more than half of EU citizens are firmly opposed to the construction of new nuclear reactors.
It is also true, however, that Russia, China, India and the United States have given the green light to nuclear energy.
It also disturbs me greatly that in the last four years the price of gas has doubled, and that the EU has become a hostage to the Russian firm Gazprom, which, conscious of its power in the field of raw materials, recently clearly showed what it is capable of doing.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us be realistic and admit that most EU citizens will not obtain energy from biomass and wind farms, yet all citizens will want to switch lights on, heat their houses and manufacture goods; in short, they will want to live and use energy.
I am convinced that nuclear energy is vital if the EU is to maintain both economic efficiency and living standards.
In this regard, it would be opportune to tell the citizens openly that this will not be possible without new, modern and, as far as possible, the safest nuclear reactors.
I feel that Greenpeace stunts or wind farms cannot take on the competition from Asia and America, which is based on using nuclear energy.
I very much hope that this isÂ clear not onlyÂ to the Commission â which after all is well aware of the fact â but above allÂ to Germany, which wants to decommission nuclear reactors within 15 years, even though it calls itself the industrial engine of Europe and a driving force for progress.
To conclude, I have a little nugget to offer opponents of nuclear energy, namely the latest report from Euronews.
A short time ago, Euronews experts asserted that atomic energy is the best way of reducing global warming.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission by MrÂ Brok, MrÂ Moscovici and MrÂ VanÂ Orden, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union (O-0034/2006 B6-0019/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, it was in April last year that this House considered the treaties relating to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria and resolved that it would agree to these treaties being signed, the meaning of which decision is that it is the will of this House that Romania and Bulgaria should become Member States of the European Union, and that the date named in the treaty is 1 January 2007.
That is indeed the case and it is not open to question.
There are questions, however â not about membership itself, but about the date.
These treaties explicitly state that May this year â the Commission has specified the 16th day of that month â is the deadline for consideration as to how the two countries have complied with the requirements of the European Unionâs laws and the content of the accession treaties, not merely in terms of the laws they have decided to adopt, but also in terms of the implementation, the practical putting into effect, of them.
In saying this, I am, of course, perfectly well aware that we cannot expect them to have done this 100%, for 100% could be achieved only in a perfect world, and that is not, in these countries, going to be achieved at once.
The question therefore arises as to whether critical mass has been achieved, and it is to that that we expect answers.
I hope, Commissioner, that, in your speech, which we can expect in a moment, we will get closer to those answers.
The question also arises as to whether the deadline of 31Â December this year is sufficient to allow the necessary implementation to be carried out, or whether the two countries need another year.
Is this a suitable occasion for applying the super-safeguard clause, or would it be more appropriate to go for another option, that being that the Commission and the Council should take their decisions not now, but rather in October, in order to give these countries a couple more monthsâ time for implementation?
Is it, alternatively, conceivable, that â as is indeed possible up to three years following the two countriesâ accession â individual chapters might be set aside as a result of the insufficient transposition in them of the treaty and the European Unionâs legislation?
Might there be, for this period too, a monitoring process to determine whether this is or is not the case?
Those are the questions that arise.
It is quite clear to us from the report that you presented to this House on 3Â April that there are issues relating to corruption and internal security, to organised crime and similar matters, as well as to certain aspects of the security of trade within the internal market.
Has sufficient legislation been enacted in these areas?
We can see, for example, that Bulgaria, is, only this week, taking legislative decisions relating to its justice system.
Will it be possible for them to be implemented in a credible way by 16Â May?
These are questions that we have to consider objectively if this process is to be of benefit not only to the two countries in question, but also to the European Union.
I hope that you, Commission, will be able to help us in this respect.
We do, in any case, believe that it is in the interests of both parties â the European Union and the candidates for accession, who will, in any event, join the European Union â that the treaties be complied with and properly put into effect before this happens.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, the process of Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs joining the European Union has now reached a crucial stage, that of the decision that our institutions must take in order to confirm or postpone these two candidate countriesâ date of accession, which is scheduled for 1Â January 2007.
Following the exchange of opinions that we had with MrÂ Rehn during Aprilâs plenary, my fellow Members, MrÂ Brok and MrÂ VanÂ Orden, and I thought that it would be helpful if Parliament were to keep itself informed, on the one hand, of the arguments put forward by the Commission in terms of setting the date on which these two countries will join and, on the other hand, of the nature of the monitoring process of which their reforms are, and will be, the subject.
From this perspective, the role of the European Parliament, that of the rapporteurs, and my own role as rapporteur for Romania could be supervisory roles that I would describe as rational and fair, in the context of which we will fully exercise our right to inspect.
That is why, three weeks prior to the presentation of the Commission report on the state of progress of reforms in Romania and Bulgaria, we have come to an agreement to submit this oral question, and to do so in the spirit that MrÂ Brok was outlining just now: far from wishing to give a premature verdict on the two countriesâ membership, we simply want to put in practice to implement Parliamentâs right to be informed by the Commission of the latest developments in the monitoring process.
It is in this spirit of openness that we are submitting this question, which is focused on points that are the subject of genuine concerns and of in-depth debates, as borne out by the previous progress reports, particularly in the crucial areas of justice and of the fight against corruption.
I believe that, in the context of the support that we are giving to Romania during these months of accelerated reforms, we are establishing two important notions the rate and consistency of the progress made while remaining aware, however, that there is no such thing as a perfect political system and that a significant amount of progress has already been made.
The fact remains that we are not weakening in our resolve.
Our concern remains one of knowing whether or not the Commission â and this is indeed the crucial question â has discovered, throughout recent months, exceptional reasons for alarm that should be brought to our attention.
I do not wish to anticipate the report - that is not the aim of our debate - but I will say that, from a personal viewpoint, it seems to me that the Commission has not made such a discovery.
There obviously remain points on which Romania ought to continue to make progress.
That being said, the countryâs current situation and the speech relatively optimistic in this regard made by MrÂ Rehn during the plenary session at the beginning of this month do not appear to reveal any major weaknesses that should be addressed with as radical a measure as postponing the date of accession.
Allow me, moreover, to point out that a decision such as this could have a harmful effect on the Romanian authoritiesâ and peopleâs motivation to press on with the vast reform programmes that have already been embarked on, while accession â provided, of course, that we decide that it does not present any danger â would make it possible to stay within this virtuous circle.
It is from this angle that the postponement clause must, in my opinion, be considered.
Its aim is clear: it provides an antidote to a significantly dangerous situation.
In my opinion, it would be dangerous to overuse the postponement clause or to use it in order to voice various concerns, which are certainly understandable but which call for a different response.
With regard to less radical concerns, the aim of our oral question was to highlight the other safeguard clauses, which are of an altogether different nature and are much less dramatic.
They offer the possibility of continuous and more flexible supervision during the first three years following Romaniaâs accession to the European Union.
It would therefore fall to the Romanian authorities to address the various anxieties that could remain in relation to specific points while keeping in mind two crucial points: not only that of respect for Romanian sovereignty, of course, but also that of the demands attendant on accession to the European Union.
Â Â  . First of all I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn and the officials DG Enlargement for the serious and assiduous way in which they have been guiding and monitoring Bulgariaâs progress towards accession.
It is important that we get this right, both for the sake of the people of Bulgaria and for our own citizens.
It would be unfortunate if there were any cooling of enthusiasm for enlargement at this stage. It would be quite wrong if the prospects of Bulgaria and Romania were damaged because of any mood change.
After all, these countries complete the previous round of enlargement, the EUâs fifth round, and are not part of the next.
The Accession Treaty signed by Bulgaria and Romania on 25Â April last year, and already ratified by 15 EU Member States, deliberately contains various sorts of what might be called âconditionalityâ.
First there is the possible postponement clause allowing accession to be delayed by one year in very extreme circumstances.
This is of course a political judgement.
In my view, the consequences of postponement would be entirely negative: a slap in the face rather than encouragement; a bad signal to the Bulgarian people.
It would encourage extremist forces and shake business confidence, and nothing would be achieved that cannot be achieved by other means.
Secondly, there are separate thematic safeguard clauses.
These were also included in the accession treaties of the last ten countries that joined the European Union.
They are for possible use once accession has taken place.
Two of them relate to economic and internal market aspects, the third to the justice and policing system, combating organised crime and corruption.
This is perhaps the area of greatest concern and the focus of the oral question.
