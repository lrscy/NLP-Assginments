Clearly, new and significant efforts need to be made by Turkey in this area.
Turkey must guarantee cultural diversity and promote respect and protection for minorities under the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights and the principles established in the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, in accordance with the best practices of the Member States.
Let there be no doubt that the EU attaches great importance to this matter as an integral part of the ongoing reform process in Turkey, and will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the progress made in the field.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reply is, in principle, highly correct, even though I had also asked whether there was an intention to tackle this issue with specific action.
I gave the specific example of a Kurdish mayor dismissed for having provided municipal language services in his language, in an area in which 72% of the population is Kurdish.
I therefore wanted to ask whether the Council intends to take any steps to tackle this issue during the dialogue by asking, for example, for the mayor to be reinstated, because in the meantime it is even illegal to write the names of the villages in Kurdish and the office of the governor of Dyarbakir, for example, yesterday opposed and practically dismissed the municipal council, which wanted the names of the streets to be written in both Kurdish and Turkish.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Mr President, I should very briefly like to say to the honourable Member that all questions concerning dialogue on issues such as human rights and respect for minoritiesare subject to very close and thorough monitoring by the EU.
That applies to this case and others.
Please rest assured that we shall be doing this.
(DE) I wanted to ask another question.
Turkey is always announcing legislative amendments, but never passes the laws, and the situation is getting worse.
So I would like to ask: do you think that the law on language that you mentioned and the freedom of religious expression legislation that we cited will actually go through this year?
What will the Council do if they are not passed this year?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) All I can say to the honourable Member is that it is my hope and desire that this will effectively be the case.
In fact, the national authorities in Turkey are entitled to adopt whatever legislation they wish.
The Council has no means, as you can imagine, of obliging Turkey to adopt any legislation.
Naturally, the Council can make its wishes known on any given matter, and express its satisfaction.
This is naturally what we have been doing, as you are aware, in the context of the negotiating process for Turkey's accession to the EU.
Obviously, these issues also have ramifications for this negotiation process.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to say that security of supply is one of the three objectives of the Community's energy policy; the purpose of this policy is the highest possible degree of energy security.
However, as with other Community policies, energy policy must also take other factors into account, such as costs, internal market regulations, and, most importantly, the EU's overall objectives on climate change.
Energy security is not an objective and quantifiable goal to which a numerical value can be affixed.
It must be looked upon as a dynamic process depending on EU interaction with third-party countries and on EU citizens' preferences with regard to the energy mix and technological development.
In reply, then, to the first question, the Council has not set an objective for energy security, as mentioned by the honourable Member, nor, to the best of the Council's knowledge, is any legislative proposal of this nature being prepared by the Commission.
The Presidency of the Council would also like to stress that one of the main objectives of the development and implementation of the Community's internal and external energy policy over the forthcoming decades is to guarantee and improve security of supply in the EU.
This was made clear once again, as you know, in the conclusions of the European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007, conclusions that may almost be considered historic in this respect.
The main elements of the Community's energy policy that contribute directly or indirectly to increased security of supply, and that will continue to be the main driving force for increased security of supply in the EU over the next 20 years, as the honourable Member mentions, are, firstly, diversification, with regard to both the sources and suppliers of energy; secondly, an increase in the use of renewable energies; thirdly, greater energy efficiency; and, fourthly, the strengthening of the Community's energy networks.
In addition to these major objectives and political guidelines, the Council Action Plan, adopted in March, sets out a number of other measures, such as a study of gas storage facilities, the development of effective crisis-response mechanisms, and the creation of an Energy Observatory, which will result in added security of supply for the EU as a whole and for each of the Member States.
(PL) I would like to thank you above all for your very detailed answer, but I would like to ask if there is any investment programme, as energy investments need to be made over many years and are very costly.
Is such a programme envisaged?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Mr President, what we have in the pipeline is exactly what I have stated, which is the result of the March European Council.
Naturally, it is now the Council's responsibility, based upon EU proposals, actually to put into practice what were above all strategic decisions, political decisions, guideline decisions.
The honourable Member should be in no doubt that the urgency and importance of energy issues mean that this Presidency, and other future presidencies, will be giving them absolute priority in the Union's internal and external agendas.
This is an issue that the European institutions will naturally have to approach in comprehensive, in-depth manner, certainly over the coming years, and on this point there is, I repeat, no doubt whatsoever.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Mr President, I would like to say that it is not the Council's responsibility, nor that of the President-in-Office, to comment on the Intergovernmental Conference mandate resulting from the European Council negotiations in June, in particular the matter of the Charter.
However, on this matter, I can refer to the Intergovernmental Conference mandate, agreed by all the Member States.
Annexe 1 to Mandate 5, footnote 19, is reproduced in the Protocol; in other words, the effects of the Protocol are defined in the Protocol itself.
First of all, I want to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its brief answer and I want to wish it well in its term.
I look forward to a good working relationship.
But I suppose, while you say that the Council cannot answer this question, at the same time, as regards the UK and Poland and indeed Ireland, the UK had some reason to look for a derogation, and Poland and Ireland reserved their right to do the same.
Either the Charter of Fundamental Rights has some substance and meaning or it has not.
Either it is window-dressing or it has real clout.
I am very concerned as an Irish MEP that the rights of citizens in my country may be less than the rights of citizens in other EU states if my country does not sign up to that Charter.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) I would like to add that the Portuguese Presidency received a mandate from the Council, a mandate agreed upon by all 27 Member States.
It is the Portuguese Presidency's responsibility during its term in office, to transform this mandate into the new Reform Treaty, which we hope to do speedily as the European Union needs this new Reform Treaty.
That concludes Question Time.
(The session was suspended at 9.40 pm and resumed at 10 pm)
Democratic scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on democratic scrutiny under the Development Cooperation Instrument
Member of the Commission. Madam President, honourable Members, it is a great pleasure to be here.
I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, the members of the Development Committee for the constructive dialogue that we have been able to conduct in the framework of the democratic scrutiny of our draft strategy papers.
I have on several occasions, notably in my joint letter with my colleague, Louis Michel, to the chair of the Development Committee of 26 March, reiterated our commitment to carefully examining the committee's observations on the strategy papers in the preparation of the annual action programmes and in the implementation of our projects and programmes.
We are now in the preparation phase of these programmes.
Some of them have already been forwarded to you and the remaining ones will be sent to you by this autumn in conformity with Article 8 of the Comitology Decision.
Attached to these annual action programmes, you will also receive synoptic tables explaining in detail how your observations have been taken into account or why it was not feasible to do so.
Additionally, this week in a separate letter to Mr Borrell, I illustrated the manner in which we have considered your remarks and how these have been transposed in the annual action programmes that have already been sent to you.
I am therefore somewhat disappointed to hear of a motion for a resolution critical of the Commission's programming.
I would hope that this will not call into question the spirit of open dialogue and cooperation that we are displaying and that we are ready to continue to pursue.
Please allow me now to address some of the issues raised by the Parliament on several occasions, notably in your motion for a resolution.
We are, of course, fully committed to the overarching objective of poverty alleviation and the achievement of the millennium development goals under the Development Cooperation Instrument.
I would like to point out very clearly that all activities planned under our country strategy papers are development activities and fall within the priority sectors identified in the DCI.
It must be stressed at this point that the regulation also states that we need to pursue differentiated approaches depending on the individual development contacts and needs of every country concerned.
The development needs of, for instance, Bangladesh are not the same as those of Brazil.
We agree with Parliament's view that health and education play a significant role in poverty eradication and the achievement of the millennium development goals.
At this point, I would like to reiterate the Commission's commitment to respecting the agreed 20% benchmarking on social sectors by 2009 through project programmes or budget support linked to those sectors, taking an average across all the geographical areas.
The first multiannual indicative programmes for 2007-2010 already show a clear contribution to the overall benchmark for basic health and education.
The annual action programmes under approval for 2007 confirmed this.
As soon as projects and programmes are in the implementation phase, we will provide Parliament with detailed statistics.
On official development assistance eligibility, I would like to reassure you that in the preparation of the annual action programmes we have ensured and will ensure full compliance with the DCI's provisions regarding the OECD/DAC criteria for geographical programmes, whilst at the same time maintaining the flexibility provided for in the regulation for thematic programmes.
Of course, an official assessment of this compliance will be made during the mid-term review which will start in 2009.
The Commission intends to make proposals to modify the regulations if it considers it appropriate.
As regards stakeholder consultations, we are well aware that further improvements still need to take place in the consultation process, including the participation of local and regional authorities.
It is, however, also a principle of our development assistance that it should be partner-country-led and contribute to the national development plans.
So we are trying our utmost to encourage the national authorities in each country to consult their national parliaments, regional and local authorities and civil society on their own development plans as an expression of good governance.
Our annual action programmes will explain more clearly what we have done with regard to consultations.
The recent annual action programme on Cambodia is a good example.
As regards other donor activities, the Commission has provided all available information when presenting its strategy papers, as well as progress towards achieving the millennium development goals.
Like you, we have every interest in obtaining an overall picture on the activities of all donors and we are making every effort to provide more information under a new standard mix.
Regarding the mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues such as the promotion of human rights, gender equality, democracy, good governance and environmental sustainability, of course we intend to do this.
This has been a core objective for us since the very outset.
Rest assured that we will put this into effect in the implementation phase.
Lastly, as far as your point on budget support is concerned, I would like to stress that the Commission applies strict eligibility criteria which are reassessed before each and every budget support disbursement.
In the areas of policy and strategy, and of macroeconomic stability and public financial management, when selecting countries which should receive budget support, I have tried to deal with the main elements of your resolution.
Please rest assured that you will receive detailed information on your observations when we send you the annual action programmes in the framework of your droit de regard under comitology.
The Commission remains prepared to discuss the annual action programmes before the appropriate bodies of Parliament.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I very much appreciate the comments and the content of the Commissioner's response here this evening.
I have to say it is nothing less than that I would expect from her.
I found during the whole DCI process, often when we got bogged down, that the Commissioner certainly was of great assistance in trying to move that situation on, as was her colleague, Commissioner Michel.
I am glad also to hear what she had to say about the annual action programmes because we really do need to deliver on the letter that Commissioner Ferrero Waldner and Commissioner Michel sent to Mrs Morgantini and myself as rapporteur on the DCI, because in that letter it was clear that Parliament would decide for itself what structures it would set up and the programmes and strategy papers it would examine.
I have to say also that given that the DCI was only approved last December and it is very much a new process for all of us, Parliament has hit the boards running.
Where it has been hit and miss, I have heard some very bad reports of the attitude of some people in the Commission in relation to annual action programmes.
In my own experience as chairman of group C, examining some of the Latin American countries, I have to say that the cooperation has been very good.
And I think the Commissioner should encourage the continuation of good cooperation because it creates a good atmosphere all round and creates a very good working relationship.
It allows us all to bring our best experience to addressing the issues which we all want to address, being the Millennium Development Goals and the needs of very poor people in a suffering part of the world.
I want to underscore the importance of the present period.
A lot of work has been done by the Commission and by Parliament to enable the EU to better implement its development policies.
Throughout the negotiations on the development cooperation instrument, we made it clear that we did not want to be involved in micro-management.
Micro-management is for the Commission and Council but we do want to have oversight.
It is right for Parliament to have oversight and the Commission should not fear any involvement of Parliament in that vein.
We, the Commission and the Council should be partners in seeking to be effective, and not competitive and seeking to keep things secretively to ourselves.
How can we cooperate to effectively deliver assistance to the countries we are trying to assist?
The first steps of the new DCI framework are being taken and we all have responsibilities to get it right.
DCI has formalised structures, recognising the important function that Parliament should play in its role as overseer and adviser.
We have worked hard scrutinising the strategy papers prepared by the Commission and to formulate positions on different aspects of those strategies.
I expect the Commission to give careful consideration to effect our positions on the strategy papers.
As part of our oversight role, we must insist that policy continuously focus on the achievement of the MDGs, which aim to alleviate some of the worst forms of poverty in the world.
Parliament continually needs to receive assurances to its satisfaction.
I was very impressed at the beginning of the year to hear from the German Presidency that they would forward the ACP papers to Parliament in the same way as they had forwarded the papers for the Asian and Latin American countries.
Now I understand that one Member State - although perhaps I am being unfair in this - raised some objection to that.
I know there is a multiplicity of these papers and it sounds very good that this should be addressed in some way by the JPA or the ACP member states.
But, unlike Parliament, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the African, Caribbean and Pacific House of that Assembly are not constantly in session, and the structures are not there to cope with that level of scrutiny.
We have three standing committees and perhaps we could on some selective audit basis pick some aspects of these and examine them.
But that should not in any way interfere with the need of Parliament here to take what documents this Parliament wishes and to scrutinise them in the best way possible.
Our objective should always be to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
We are not in competition.
We can work together.
For two years, during the development cooperation instrument process, we tried to persuade the Commission and others that we were really in the business of trying to find a really good instrument.
Eventually, when we were listened to, we found that instrument.
Commissioner, do not listen to bad advice.
Do not listen to people who are creating obstacles.
We are in the same team.
We want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
Do not keep from Parliament information that it should rightly have in its oversight role.
You will find that we will respond generously and effectively and helpfully.
Thank you very much for your contribution here this evening.
Before I give the floor to Mr van den Berg, I note with some sorrow that, apparently, it will be his last speech in the Chamber tonight before he moves on to other things.
I am sure we all wish you well, Mr van den Berg, although we are sorry to lose you.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, I endorse what Mr Mitchell had to say in connection with the ACP policy plans.
On 1 January of this year, the new financing instrument for development cooperation, in which the Millennium Development Goals were to occupy centre stage, entered into force.
The time has come to check whether these laws and principles have also been translated into practice.
In recent months, we in the Committee on Development have devoted much of our time to the inspection of national policy documents.
Members of staff, Members of the European Parliament and secretariats have all worked hard in the committees and in Parliament.
Having carefully scrutinised the policy strategies for the countries and regions of South America, Asia and South Africa, we have concluded that six specific cases out of a total of a huge number of plans were insufficiently underpinned legally speaking, which is why we have returned them by means of resolutions.
In a number of other cases, we have reacted by letter and raised a number of issues.
Commissioner, during the democratic scrutiny, we have also come across a number of fundamental problems, problems which you also undoubtedly face in the Commission.
The primary goal of the development cooperation instrument is to stamp out poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
This is an overarching goal which, as we see it, was not sufficiently highlighted in the national policy documents, partly because these still bear the hallmarks of the earlier, old-style plans.
I should like to remind the Commission of our firm pledge to achieve 20%.
I value what the Commissioner said a moment ago: that she guarantees that this 20% will be achieved by 2009.
If this is stated so clearly, then we trust that it will also be done.
This may be promoted by the contracts involving the Millennium Development Goals.
After all, budgetary support is given, and this must, of course, comply with the requirements, as you said with good reason.
Imagine, though, that this is done and the corresponding contracts involving the Millennium Development Goals are allowed to lapse.
This means at the very least that the government involved is known to be doing a number of things in the areas of basic education and health care.
This is when it is possible to include it in the 20% in a justified and much more clear-cut manner.
If not, all this remains very vague.
I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that, next year, EUR 50 million from 'Investing in people', the topical line of the development cooperation instrument, will be fed into the World Fund.
The World Fund is a wonderful thing, which we support.
Last year, we gave EUR 62 million.
This does mean, however, that, in practice, you are left with very little funding for the other causes that are listed under this act.
If this happens two years running, you will come unstuck.
I should like to draw your attention to this.
This is something that requires consultation with the ACP partners and the European Development Fund.
Something must be done, though, because, if not, the topical line of 'Investing in people' will in fact be an empty shell.
The European Parliament will not hesitate to use its budgetary instrument if necessary.
Ralf Walter is active on that score and - you know what he is like - he is a thoroughgoing person in this respect.
This evening, though, Commissioner, I did not want to play the role of Max Mackie Messer from the Dreigroschenoper [Threepenny Opera] because, after all, you are the one dressed in 'light blue' and, as this is my final speech, you have caught me in a good mood.
I should like to end on a personal note.
As you stated, Madam President, I have been appointed Queen's Commissioner of Groningen from 1 September.
I should like to warmly thank my fellow MEPs and staff, along with everyone in the Commission secretariats for the enormous support I have enjoyed from both Commissioner Michel and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
I am hoping to bid Parliament farewell on 28 August, on which day I hope to see you all again, but for now: all the very best to you all.
Thank you for your contribution to the work of this House.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, that was the previous speaker's last speech, and this is my first in plenary.
I trust you will treat me well.
I must begin by pointing out that the process of adopting the Regulation establishing the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) has, as we know, been torturous, complex and at times beset by a number of difficulties.
Indeed, the first answer given by Parliament aimed at rejecting the proposal itself was at the time adopted unanimously by the Committee on Development, and similarly supported unanimously by the other three committees that issued opinions on the matter.
All of which led the Commission and the Council to the negotiating table and ultimately convinced both institutions to respect Parliament's recourse to codecision.
We know all of this already.
As we all know, the proposal was ultimately adopted, although many of the same factors that gave cause for concern more than a year ago have not gone away.
In the intervening year, Parliament has tabled three resolutions warning the Commission that it was exceeding its powers and asking it to rectify the situation, which it has singularly failed to do.
The Commission should also be reminded what may happen if it overdoes comitology with this Chamber.
Parliament is moving ahead without looking at matters carefully, and I feel that the very fact that this resolution has been adopted unanimously in the Committee on Development is highly significant.
For example, the DCI regulation states that 'the Community will promote a development process that is partner country led and owned'.
We should like to know, however, if there was contact with the parliaments of these partner countries prior to the adoption of strategy documents and if so whether there are details of these meetings available.
The DCI regulation also promotes inclusive and participatory approaches and a broad involvement of all segments of society in the development process and in national dialogue, yet we do not have any information on whether or not this series of contacts has actually taken place.
We also feel that there is little or no information on the extent to which the DCI financed these strategy papers.
We should like to know if these strategy papers have benefited from other sources of funding, and if so how much of them will be funded by those sources.
In short, are there any programmes within the strategy papers that do not have a Millennium Development Goals profile, as laid down in the DCI regulation?
If so, how much money have these programmes been granted?
Our group continues to have these and many other doubts.
Perhaps these doubts will be cleared up in these communications, which you have just announced, from the Committee on Development.
We have not forgotten, however, that the DCI regulation mentions transparency as the key to the implementation of the programmes as many as seven times.
We feel that we must lead by example and that the Commission should ensure that Parliament is kept fully informed in order to dispel the concerns engendered by the manner in which this instrument has been managed over the past six months.
(FI) Madam President, last year during the Finnish Presidency we reached an important compromise on the Development Cooperation Instrument, meaning the Community will in future be able to fulfil its commitments on aid and guarantee the uninterrupted financing of external relations.
The DCI Regulation takes account of the multi-dimensionality of poverty.
It is thus a promising basis for development cooperation and for reducing poverty.
If the Millennium targets are to be hit, there need to be precision weapons.
The Regulation is the first act to reinforce the definition of development cooperation policy provided by the OECD Development Assistance Committee.
This is crucial in guaranteeing that the budget allocated to development cooperation is not used to achieve other political goals.
Unfortunately, practice has not reflected the Regulation's content.
In its draft country strategy papers for individual countries, the Commission has repeatedly overstepped its executive powers, and not taken the aims of the DCI into account.
In its resolutions, Parliament has already frequently pointed out that the main aim of the draft strategy papers has not been the elimination of poverty.
They have thus not met the requirements of official development aid as defined by the OECD Development Assistance Committee.
The Commission cannot go on ignoring the essential content of the DCI and the core ideas of the OECD's development cooperation policy.
Under the Regulation, financing may only take the form of budget support if a country's public expenditure management is sufficiently transparent.
The criteria for eligibility must be strictly applied.
It is also crucial to support the parliamentary control of partner countries.
It is the poor level of control in third countries that is largely the reason why representative democracy cannot respond to the whims of strong governments.
I am also rather disappointed that the Commission has been very unwilling to cooperate on its own initiative.
The Commission should remember that the European Parliament has an essential role in the implementation of the DCI.
(PT) For the first time, within the scope of this new instrument, Parliament has played a scrutinising role with regard to national strategies.
I consider the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission to have been very constructive and feel that it should serve as a model for further possible and desirable collaboration, as in the case of the ACP countries.
However, there is still room for improvement in the cooperation between the two institutions, namely with regard to data sharing.
Parliament considers it very important to receive clarification on the way in which the various national strategies, as a whole, can contribute to the financial commitment to allocate 20% of available funds to basic healthcare and education.
With regard to the priorities indicated in various national strategy documents, I regret that, generally speaking, there is not greater investment in the Millennium Development Goals.
The aim of this financial instrument is to combat poverty, in particular by achieving these goals.
A number of national strategy documents include activities relating to trade, higher education, civil aviation and even the promotion of the EU in receiving countries.
Parliament understands the importance of some of these actions particularly for the authorities of the countries in question.
I believe, however, that our priority, and that of the Commission, should be the activities that are directly related to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which have a far more direct impact on the fight against poverty.
These should be the priority.
They cannot be omitted, as happens in some cases.
I would point out that Parliament has not received answers to all the questions put to the Commission during this process.
I am sure that they will be forthcoming, as indeed we have been informed today by the Commissioner, and for which I thank her.
I am sorry to see Mr van den Berg go, as you mentioned, Madam President.
Nobody is irreplaceable, but there are people who are more easily replaceable than others.
That is certainly not the case with Max!
We Socialists, in particular, will miss him a lot.
(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, you are well aware that the analysis of the implementation of the Development Cooperation Instrument is now a very important part of the work of the committee I have the honour of chairing.
We attach a great deal of importance to this process and hope that the Commission will fully take on board the comments that Parliament makes.
Parliament in particular must ensure that the core objective of the DCI, which is to eradicate poverty, is achieved and that the funds earmarked for this instrument are devoted purely to this activity.
It must also ensure that 20% is earmarked for education and health, and yet we do not see very clearly how this 20% objective can be achieved by 2009.
Commissioner, it is very important that all stakeholders are consulted and that horizontal policies such as promoting human rights, gender equality, good governance, the rights of children, the rights of indigenous peoples, environmental sustainability and the fight against diseases such as AIDS are also adequately taken into account in all programmes and for all countries.
This is what we want to achieve with our democratic analysis of the proposals you made and we hope that our contribution and the work we put into it, which was characterised by a spirit of cooperation, is reflected in the annual action plans.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, we have done a lot of work together, and, at least in my view, it has been a constructive dialogue under this democratic scrutiny.
It has included numerous parliamentary debates and many exchanges of views between distinguished Members of this House, myself, my colleague Louis Michel and many Commission officials.
We have exchanged a series of letters - the last one, as I have said, to Mr Borrell Fontelles.
As has been mentioned, three parliamentary resolutions have been voted on, with a fourth currently under discussion.
Now we are entering a new phase: the implementation of projects and programmes, where each institution will have to play its specific role.
I agree with Mr Mitchell, who said that Parliament is responsible for oversight.
We absolutely agree with that, but not with micro-management, and we will give Parliament - you can be sure - a maximum amount of information.
To Mr van den Berg, I would say that, first of all, we would like to pay tribute to the great work that you have been doing on development issues, but also, particularly, as chief observer on difficult missions.
I have appreciated very strongly your balanced approach to that.
As regards the specific issue that we are discussing tonight - the consultation on the thematic programme, investing in people - I will inform Louis Michel of the request for consultation within and with the ACP partners, as has been mentioned.
For the rest, I can only say that we have really tried to take things into account.
But, please, give us credit also for being a responsible organisation and responsible stakeholders on this scene.
If we can work as partners, you will have a very responsible partner.
I have received one motion for resolution to wind up the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 12 July 2007.
Community Statistical Programme (2008-2012) - Timely transmission and verification of statistical data provided by Member States (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Zsolt LÃ¡szlÃ³ Becsey, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community Statistical Programme 2008 to 2012 C6-0427/2006, and
the oral question to the Commission on the timely transmission and verification of statistical data provided by Member States by Zsolt LÃ¡szlÃ³ Becsey and Alexander Radwan, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - B6-0123/2007).
rapporteur and author. - (HU) I am very pleased because now, after first reading, it looks like we may reach the consensus needed for a joint decision before the summer recess.
A very great work on the part of three institutions lies behind all this.
First of all, let me acknowledge the excellent work done by the Committee.
Their proposal reflects superbly both the Community's current priorities and the mechanism of the present Treaty of Nice.
I wish to give special recognition to the German Presidency, and more particularly to Mr Radermacher, president of the Federal Statistical Office, who, by setting an incredibly fast pace, made it possible to elaborate and become familiar with the Council's position.
The priorities of the European Parliament were thus taken into consideration even while the work was in progress.
Similar special acknowledgement must also be extended to the shadow rapporteurs of the other two major groups, the socialists and liberals, for the job they have carried out.
It is thanks to this work that an almost overwhelming majority lined up behind the joint compromises in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
What did Parliament accomplish in this joint text?
One major result is that in the principal section, the range of otherwise well-chosen items recommended as priorities by the Committee has been expanded.
Considerations regarding innovation, development of human resources, regional cohesion and demographic challenges now come into the picture.
As a result, the list of priorities has become balanced without being overabundant.
Another important result is, in my opinion, the compromise reached with respect to cooperation between administrations at both national and local levels as well as in the area of statistics management.
I hope that this will bear fruit with regard to quality as well, which is a particularly important point that will be addressed later on in connection with the oral question raised about the reliability of macroeconomic projections and short-term statistical data.
What, then, was the priority of the rapporteur?
In addition to improving the quality and speed of statistical services, I considered my main task to be the lessening of the financial and administrative burdens, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
It was also important to make sure that the demands of regulation does not lead to a confusion between protection of individually submitted commercial data and the obligation to provide general statistical data.
We also managed to minimize the burden of supplying the data required by international, mainly UN obligations, thanks primarily to the flexibility of the shadow rapporteurs.
A huge challenge is also presented by our own as well as international commitments, but in this regard I expect a more cautious approach, and that is what we have approved.
We must not overburden ourselves in the area of statistical capability and the export of know-how.
I consider it a good outcome, as well, that we were able to agree on the main points of the 2010 mid-term progress report.
On the basis thereof, I would like to see a Commission proposal for a directive that would help overcome the political problem of the statistical conception determining the work programme of another, new Parliament and Committee, and would ensure instead that our new colleagues can incorporate their programmes of work directly into the clear framework of statistical work.
In addition, we made reference to the major challenges facing us, also expected for 2010, namely the reforms of CAP and of the Financial Services Directive, the entry into force of the Services Directive or the appearance of new Community policies, the monitoring of immigration, crime and climate change in the area of statistics as well.
The greatest success of Parliament is the fact that, as of January 2010, the mid-term progress reports will not only reach members of the European statistics network and committees of experts, but will also be formally submitted to the Council and to Parliament, on the basis of the proposal.
As a result, these fundamental institutions will be able to have their say, as of the next parliamentary cycle, about the strategic and tactical problems of the day.
In the area of sectoral priorities, questions by Parliament were also successfully incorporated into the report; suffice it to mention the challenges presented by the human resources development indicators, urbanisation, equal opportunities for women and the measurement of the processes of agglomeration.
Thank you, Madam President, and now I would like to continue with the other line of questioning.
There is great hope, upon joining, that the macroeconomic supervisory system, and the fact that a Member State's economic policy is a shared concern, along with the existence of a stability and growth pact, would help us to be more secure inside the European Union than outside of it.
The EC Treaty declares joint responsibility for the economic policies of Member States, and I suppose for their failures too.
The European Parliament votes for and supervises the Commission, which, among other things, oversees Eurostat.
Since 2004, the Greek and Hungarian problems revealed grave deficiencies in this system.
In both countries there occurred economic policy and data manipulations that even influenced elections, necessitating not only severe corrections later on, but also undermining trust in common institutions.
The Eurobarometer showed a steep decline in Hungary.
In Hungary, since 2004 there have been continual discrepancies of several percentage points between the promised results and the reality that was later acknowledged.
There is great discrepancy between the end of 2005 and of 2006, for instance: the amount of debt showed a difference of more than 10 percentage points in comparison to the GDP, in other words between the promised and the subsequently demonstrated reality.
Unfortunately, Mr Almunia is absent, because if he were listening now, he would hear that in 2005 and 2006, instead of taking into account market projections like those of Goldman Sachs and Standard [amp] Poor's, the government's misleading remarks were heeded instead.
The market saw the catastrophe, and also sensed the unlawful dismissal of the Statistics Office staff.
Yet the forecasting system was a fiasco.
The most shameful situation occurred in May 2006.
At that time Mr Almunia predicted that all the indices would improve in Hungary, inflation would be low, growth would be high, while the prime minister was predicting extremely grave problems and an austerity programme.
He admitted they had made phone calls to Mr Almunia and used hundreds of tricks.
Afterwards Mr Almunia, - he would hear this if he was present - threw up his hands: we did not include the pensions in the deficit, we did not include the hidden deficits of state enterprises, we did not know how to account for the motorway.
I believe all this is double-talk.
In conclusion: the Hungarian prime minister admitted serious political collusion, regrettably also with a member of the Commission, and it shows.
Such "wizardryâ should never be allowed to happen again, because elections are approaching after all, elections will take place again in the future, and only the admission of truth can help.
I think therefore the Commission must also acknowledge these political conclusions, because the price of this lack of credibility will ultimately be paid not by us but by the population of Hungary.
Member of the Commission.
Madam President, Members of Parliament. I would first of all like to thank Mr Becsey and Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the excellent report on the Community Statistical Programme for 2008-2012.
This will indeed allow a timely adoption of the legal basis and a smooth start to the programme in 2008.
The Community Statistical Programme constitutes the framework for the production of all statistics as well as the financial framework for the production of Community statistics during the programme period.
Statistics are a key element for policy-making and, as such, the new programme has indeed focused on the current priorities of the Union, from growth and competitiveness to sustainable development and security.
Parliament's amendments, aimed at strengthening the gender and regional dimensions in statistics and substantiating the reporting obligations, are particularly welcomed by the Commission.
I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, once again, as well as the Committee on Regional Development for their valuable efforts to provide the Community with a solid basis for the production of statistics over the next five years.
Regarding fiscal statistics and the oral question by Mr Becsey and Mr Radwan, the Commission certainly agrees that the quality of fiscal data is vital for the correct functioning of Economic and Monetary Union and its budgetary surveillance system as well as for the assessment of the convergence criteria when evaluating the application of a Member State for entry into the euro area.
Fiscal statistics, like any other statistics, are subject to revision.
Data are routinely revised when new information on government transactions becomes available or when errors or inconsistencies are identified and corrected.
Revision also takes place in a paramount effort to comply better with the accounting rules.
For statisticians, data usually become final only after four years at the earliest.
Most revisions, in fiscal statistics, are small and have no significant impact on economic analysis and fiscal surveillance.
Unfortunately, there have also been some episodes of large revisions in fiscal statistics that put fiscal surveillance under stress.
However, it is important to note that, in most cases, those revisions have not been a surprise.
They were indeed preceded by public statements by Eurostat, drawing attention to the fact that the data initially reported by the Member States were not in compliance with the accounting rules and requiring Member States to amend them.
Whenever necessary Eurostat has even itself amended data reported by the Member States.
In compliance with Regulation 2103/2005, Eurostat has reported - and will report regularly to the European Parliament and to the Council - on the quality of the fiscal data transmitted by Member States.
With regard to forecasts, the Commission regularly assesses the forecasts and projections announced by Member States in their stability and convergence programmes by comparing them with the Commission's own forecasts.
For several Member States, the Commission has publicly noted on some occasions that the fiscal forecasts contained in the stability and convergence programmes were based on optimistic macroeconomic projections.
The Commission has also pointed out cases where the national projections were not compliant with the accounting rules for specific transactions or where the planned policy measures underlying the forecasts had not yet been confirmed.
In preparing its own forecasts, the Commission systematically compares its numbers with projections released by the IMF, the OECD and other organisations.
Experience shows that the forecasts published by the Commission - both the macroeconomic and the fiscal figures - are not biased and are at least as reliable as those of other forecasters.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Becsey for his report.
I would like to thank him twice, firstly as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee for Regional Development, and secondly as a representative of my political group.
I will not dwell on the definition of statistics.
I will only say that it is a science that assesses phenomena and processes of a mass nature in a quantitative way. Its aim is to assess the rules governing these phenomena and quantifying them.
Statistics also make it possible to summarise the results of analyses and to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the results.
I say this for good reason, as statistical data are often the basis for important decisions taken both at local and regional as well as at national, European and even world level.
It is therefore a good thing that we have a community statistical programme for the years 2008-2012.
The realistic and responsible preparation of statistical data is exceptionally valuable.
Obtaining them, therefore, involves costs.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether our ambitious programme for the next five years has sufficient financial backing.
We are undertaking a task that will cover 27 Member States with differing degrees of experience in this sensitive area.
So let me ask a second question: what steps have been taken to secure the best possible coordination in statistical analysis?
The Commissioner was kind enough to emphasise the importance of the Committee on Regional Development's opinion, and I would like to thank her for this flattering assessment.
To go on to regional issues: in the 2007-2013 Perspective the European Union allocated over one-third of its budget to regional policy in the broad sense of the word, thereby implementing the principle of cohesion and solidarity between regions with very differing levels of prosperity.
This money was European taxpayers' money, which should under no circumstances be squandered.
That is why we need completely impartial, sufficiently comprehensive and reliable methods of monitoring the implementation of structural policy.
Do we have such methods?
They involve collating and processing statistical data, both at Community level, at Member State level and at regional and lower, at local level.
The nature of the data must be comparable, both with data recorded outside the European Union and with the data recorded within it, as we often compare ourselves with other countries.
The implementation of short-term or temporary objectives or technical problems have resulted in temporary lapses in compiling statistical data, all with drastic results.
Statistical analyses of regions are based on NUTS units.
The question this raises is does this separation always result in equally reliable data?
I have my reservations in particular of situations where there is a large gap between the development level and the prosperity of a regional capital and the rest of the area.
Another question I would like to raise is that of development level indexes for countries or regions: is the per capita GDP enough, what weighting should be given to unemployment levels, how can quality of life in a particular area be measured, etc.
These are important issues, and I know that there are no simple solutions.
We often speak of innovation in this House.
So we need to have reliable data on education, science, research and innovation.
The question this raises is what methods should be used to compare data that often come from unofficial sources?
How can we define the dynamics of change?
One more question of a social nature.
Changes associated with large-scale migration, particularly of workers, are taking place before our very eyes.
How does this affect the social situation and families?
And we should not forget either that the high level of reliability of statistical data is always dependent on the reliability of the sources of information, which in turn requires the reliability and frequently the anonymity of the original data.
To finish, I would like to express my hope that the Community statistical programme will serve the fundamental aims of the European Union well.
The attitude of Eurostat, and also of the Polish Central Statistical Office convince me of this.
I hope that this is so.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by congratulating and thanking the rapporteur.
In his report, he has called for the legislative and statistical cycles to be brought into synch, for a reduction in the administrative burden for small and medium-sized companies, he has said that we need to ensure that we receive quality data, which means better data, and that we should also include a number of social and macroeconomic indicators.
He has also reported that we have submitted a request to the Commission, for two reasons.
One reason is the recurring complaints about Member States who supply incomplete statistical data - the main culprits are Greece, Portugal, Italy and Hungary.
In one country, Hungary, the Prime Minister actually admitted to fudging the data and hiding the truth from the public and the Commission.
The second reason is that many requirements have not yet been implemented.
I would like to mention one: the Commission must be entitled to verify the data supplied in the country.
It should be possible for the Commission to hold discussions with the national banks, the finance, economy and labour ministries, and with economic research institutes in the country.
We cannot simply rely on the data provided.
The Commission's data has to be compared with the European Central Bank's data.
There are various figures of varying degrees of importance that need to be compared.
Thirdly, for all euro-related information - data relating to budgets, the Stability and Growth Pact and the Maastricht criteria - the European Central Bank, the Commission and the Member States have to produce a joint final report.
We need unified, transparent data collection standards.
We are all familiar with the unemployment figures from the Member States and for the European Union.
One is played off against the other for reasons of political expediency.
This creates uncertainty, not transparency, and only engenders distrust.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I would also like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work on this report on the statistics programme 2008-2012.
I think we fully agree that statistics are essential, and how to get the correct data is an important issue.
I agree that it is not only a technical issue, as we can see from this debate and particularly from the oral question that has been asked, it is an issue of high political relevance and not only because politicians try to interfere in statistics but also because they try to use such events in making opposition to the governing coalition or the previous coalition, blaming them for not providing correct data.
These are both things which we should absolutely avoid.
The only solution, in my view, is to have independent statistical offices and guarantees for independent, proper and high-quality statistical data, plus some of the elements that Mr Karas mentioned: the same basic definitions etc.
I have the impression, Commissioner, that a lot of work has already been done on this issue by your colleague Mr Almunia, and some of the things have already been put in motion.
I refer, for instance, to the regulation that has been established on this issue and, in particular, to dossiers with proposals for legislation on the governance of statistics and the governance of the statistical institutions, which we are dealing with at the moment.
I must say to Mr Becsey and Mr Karas that I have been surprised that their political group has not been interested at all in these legislative dossiers that we are dealing with at the moment because, here, we can create guarantees for good governance on the data, and there is no mandate for the Commission or for Eurostat really to interfere or to centralise data provision.
We have to work within the remit and the mandate that exists at the moment and, there, I think the Commissioner is doing a good job in trying to use this to the widest extent possible.
I hope we can have a constructive debate about this improvement of governance and about these better conditions to be created instead of blaming each other and blaming the other political opposition parties for not properly providing this data.
I hope there will be a constructive approach in the future.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Becsey, on his excellent work.
His having helped to achieve adoption at first reading is significant, and demonstrates that this Parliament works well.
As has already been observed by the Commissioner as well as by other speakers, the aim of Community statistics is thus to provide regular verification of the drafting, implementation and evaluation of Community policies.
The Union puts forward and carries out its policies in the economic, environmental and social fields precisely on the basis of this information; hence the need that it should be as relevant as possible to the actual situation, providing a 'photograph' of ideal situations, as well as the specific needs of citizens.
As far as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is concerned, I can confirm in this Chamber that, generally speaking, we are firmly in favour of the proposal put forward by the Commission, in the knowledge that it has dealt with significant problems and issues such as prosperity, competitiveness, growth, solidarity, economic and social cohesion, sustainable development, security and further enlargement of the European Union.
I believe that we, as the European Parliament, have done well to add to the proposal by including innovation and human development, regional cohesion and the demographic challenges that European society must tackle.
Our contribution therefore takes this approach: adding to, and not distorting, the Commission's proposal.
In fact, we are convinced that there is currently a problem, which we discovered while finalising the adoption of this report: dealing with the quality of data, which is also the guarantee of the quality of decision-making.
We have therefore included in the final text, which was the subject of a compromise, the concept of the preparation of annual statistical work programmes and of the need to take into consideration the optimum use of resources.
This is in relation to the principle of better regulation, which we have already adopted, and precisely in the light of the Commission's communication on reducing the burden of responding to the simplification of objectives in the field of Community statistics.
Finally, I believe that we have made some important additions: a requirement for the Commission to carry out ex ante analyses of the financial impacts of the new statistical activities planned that involve additional burdens for the Member States, as well as feasibility studies to achieve a quality label for European statistics and to reinforce the credibility of the European statistical system, including Eurostat, the national statistical authorities and other relevant bodies in each Member State that are responsible for compiling and distributing European statistics.
The aim is certainly to have central independent statistics available, but we need to do more work to achieve this.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, I would first like to say that we have an ambitious programme, but do we have the financial means?
Well, I think so.
The financial envelope for the 2008-2012 programme in fact represents an increase of 15% compared to the previous period.
I think that is a higher increase than the average increase for the financial perspective 2007-2013.
So I think that is settled.
With regard to coordination, let me say that this Parliament is currently analysing a proposal by the Commission to set up a high-level advisory board which will then improve the governance of the European statistics system and the coordination of the production of statistics.
I think this will be important.
I also would like to say to Mr Karas that what you mentioned is absolutely right. We have a possibility as the Commission to examine the methodology that is used by the Member States.
But, unfortunately, we do not have the possibility to go further and examine the data as such.
And, unfortunately, I think the Commission has already tried, but the Member States until now at least have not wanted to go any further.
So maybe this is also something that should be brought to their attention again.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 12 July 2007.

Reducing disparities in the poorest regions of the EU (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the role and effectiveness of cohesion policy in reducing disparities in the poorest regions of the EU.
rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to warmly congratulate you on having taken up this honourable office.
The European Union consists not only of 27 countries, but also of 268 regions, which have extremely different levels of development.
As a result of the most recent enlargement to create a Union of 27 countries, the population of the Community rose to nearly 493 million.
Around 30% of these people live in 100 of the poorest regions, namely those covered by the convergence objectives.
Each consecutive enlargement has resulted in greater inequality between the richest and the poorest regions in the Community.
Now, in a Union of 27 countries, differences in the levels of GDP between the regions are significantly more pronounced than they were in the old fifteen, and amount to 24% in north-eastern Romania to 303% in central London.
The reasons for the economic under-development of specific regions vary greatly.
The poorest regions mainly lack the basic infrastructure necessary for sustainable, long-term development, further investment and the necessary human resources.
As statistics show, the existing European Union cohesion policy has effectively contributed to the development of many regions of countries which have long been included within its framework, such as Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain.
In accordance with the aims of the Community, as stated in Article 158 of the Treaty on European Union, which include harmonised development and the reduction of disparities between levels of development in different regions, we the European Parliament call for decisive action aimed at reducing the most serious cases of under-development in the poorest regions of the European Union.
The new Member States have been particularly affected by the difficulties related to absorbing EU funds, as the fact that they have been granted does not guarantee that they will be used properly, and the authorities in poor regions often do not have the ability, experience or resources required to fully benefit from the funds to which they are entitled.
The application procedures for structural fund aid are often extremely complicated and in no way transparent for the end user.
We therefore call for these procedures to be simplified at all levels, namely at European, national and regional level.
The implementation of cohesion policy should take into account the varied needs of the regions, especially urban and rural areas, regions that are difficult to access, islands and ultraperipheral regions.
It should adapt the aid provided to their conditions and specific characteristics, exploiting their potential for sustainable and long-term growth.
The Member States and the regions should therefore ensure that priority is granted to those projects that contribute to improving accessibility to the poorest regions, ensuring that they have a proper transport and information technology infrastructure.
Cohesion policy should support entrepreneurship and investment in the poorest regions.
New financial instruments, such as JEREMY and JESSICA, can successfully contribute to regional development, but awareness of how to use these instruments at a local and regional level is still very limited.
It is important to encourage Member States to form public-private partnerships and exchange good practice concepts in this field.
The Commission and the Member States should effectively support projects that increase the regions' abilities to generate and absorb new technologies, while paying particular attention to protecting the natural environment.
An incredibly important problem for the poorest regions of the Union has been high levels of unemployment, up to 20%.
In view of this, there is an urgent need to invest in human capital in poor regions through better education, constantly improving qualifications, especially for young people, women, and older people, as well as minorities at risk of social exclusion.
Support for equal opportunities for all should form part of all Community programmes, especially those which influence economic and social cohesion, as well as at all levels of planning and implementing projects within the framework of the European Union's cohesion policy.
The Commission and the Member States should ensure that accurate, comprehensive and comparable statistical data is available.
This is something that we are currently lacking.
The Commission should draw up a new method of measuring regional development, not only on the basis of GDP and unemployment rates, but also on the basis of other qualitative and quantitative indicators which reflect the real living standards of the population.
We should also improve our methods of calculating purchasing power parity by developing regional rather than national indicators.
Taking advantage of the interim review of the Community budget in 2009, the Commission should analyse the effects of cohesion policy and investigate possible causes of undesirable results.
Finally, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this report.
I would like to thank you for your valuable amendments, which have enriched the document, and I sincerely hope that this own initiative report will provide the Member States and the regions with a host of valuable guidelines, as well as stimulating the European Commission to improve the effectiveness of cohesion policy in the most needy regions.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, it is a pleasure to come before Parliament to exchange views on the Geringer de Oedenberg report on the role and effectiveness of cohesion policy in reducing disparities in the poorest regions of the European Union.
Once again, as in the case of other own-initiative reports adopted by the Committee on Regional Development, this proves the excellent collaboration between our two institutions.
I am speaking on behalf of Mrs HÃŒbner, who has had to go to Romania, and she sends you her best wishes.
I welcome this report and I appreciate its positive contribution to the debate on the impact and effectiveness of cohesion policy at a critical moment of the 2007-2013 programming period and on the eve of the budgetary review to be carried out in the year 2008/09.
I fully share the view that the cohesion policy is not only essential but also effective in reducing socioeconomic and territorial disparities and in tapping the development potential of all EU regions.
The value added of cohesion policy has already been proved, and we all recognise that it goes well beyond financial transfers to include, among other things, the development of partnerships, exchanges of best practice, budgetary stability and a strategic approach.
I particularly appreciate the theme and the content of your report because it touches on the backbone of cohesion policy.
Indeed, the main goal of our policy is to reduce the socioeconomic and territorial disparities in the poorest EU regions.
The challenge is not negligible.
These disparities have dramatically increased following the recent enlargements, and cohesion policy is the only Community instrument specially designed to this aim.
For instance, disparities in GDP per head between the top and bottom 10% EU regions have almost doubled after the two most recent enlargements.
In fact, regional disparities in the EU are very important, much more than within the United States or Japan, or of a similar dimension to that in China and India for instance.
Despite impressive growth rates in the new Member States and the convergence of many regions of the EU-15, there are still 70 regions - home to 123 million Europeans - with a GDP per head below 75% of the EU average.
In addition, there are a number of regions - the majority of which are among the most developed ones - which are losing ground.
In 27 regions, GDP per head declined in real terms between the years 2000 and 2004 and, in another 24, growth was under 0.5% per year.
Nevertheless, as explained in full in the recently published Fourth Cohesion Report, convergence is taking place. This is due both to the accelerated growth of most of the new Member States and to the sometimes sluggish performance of some of the most advanced ones.
On the whole, the periphery of the EU is catching up with the core of Europe not only in terms of GDP per head but also of employment, productivity and other indicators, and this is good news.
This includes the former cohesion countries which, with the exception of Portugal, in the last few years have experienced impressive progress.
This phenomenon - the long-term convergence process - is especially occurring at EU level between Member States and regions.
We know that, at national level, the picture is somehow different, since in many cases growth is increasingly concentrated in the capital region or in the main metropolitan areas, which deepens the internal disparities and causes problems related to agglomeration, like transport congestion, pollution, housing price rises and so on.
Let me underline the substantial contribution of our policy to this overall positive convergence process.
Independent evaluation studies have shown that cohesion policy has supported much-needed investment in infrastructure, human resources, modernisation and diversification of regional economies.
Between 2000 and 2005, public investment in the four cohesion countries has been around 25% higher than it would have been without cohesion policy.
It has contributed to the growth of GDP.
Increasing GDP levels attributable to regional policy ranged from 10% in Greece and 8.5% in Portugal in the period 1989-1999, and 6% for Greece and Portugal, 4% in the German LÃ€nder and 2.4% in Spain in the period 2000-2006.
Preliminary estimates for 2007-2013 suggest an impact of between 5% and 9% in the new Member States.
It has also contributed to reduced social exclusion and poverty.
Cohesion policy cofinances the training of nine million people annually.
More than half of them are women, leading to better employment conditions and higher income.
For example, over 450 000 gross jobs were generated in six countries: Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK.
Between 2000 and 2005 it accounted for two thirds of Objective 2 funding.
It has helped shift the policy mix of public investment in Member States towards growth-enhancing investment.
According to the most recent data, the amount of cohesion investment earmarked for research and development, innovation and information and communication technologies (ICTs) for 2007-2013 has more than doubled in comparison with the years 2000-2006.
Clearly, it remains to be seen how these plans will be implemented, but we already see, among both the Member States and the regions, an increasing awareness in their development strategies for the next financial period.
Certainly, one of the keys of this success lies in the fact that cohesion policy is an integrated, fully-fledged policy; it is not a sectoral policy, or a disjointed bundle of sectoral policies, but an integrated instrument aimed at delivering specific tailor-made solutions for each European region or territory.
At the same time, it is not just an EU policy that operates in isolation but it certainly depends on the active involvement of partners at national, regional and local level.
Your report correctly points to a number of issues which are particularly relevant for the poorest regions if they are to make the best use of the allocated funds.
I shall mention just a few likely to provide them with appropriate technical assistance.
The importance of designing tailor-made development strategies, or the value of implementing effective partnership and encouraging good practices.
I took note of your proposals.
I am convinced that some of them will find their way into the current legislative framework that has given rise to the new initiatives recently adopted by the Commission, like the three 'J's - Jasper, Jeremy and Jessica - or Regions for economic change.
The flexibility of cohesion policy makes it possible to implement the best measures adopted for each case.
In this regard, Mrs HÃŒbner will ensure that the Commission pays particular attention to the needs of the poorest regions in the ongoing negotiations on the programming documents for the years 2007-2013.
I also appreciate the contribution of your report to the debate on future cohesion policy, which was launched by the publication of the fourth cohesion report.
I welcome these valuable recommendations aiming at increasing the efficiency of cohesion policy.
As you know, we are now at the initial stage of reflection on the future of cohesion policy.
This debate aims at nurturing the review of the EU budget that the Commission has to undertake in the years 2008 and 2009.
In conclusion, you are aware that the public consultation on the future of cohesion policy will be launched following the cohesion forum to be held at the end of September.
A dedicated internet site will collect the contributions of Member States, regions, cities, EU institutions, economic and social partners and, of course, civil society organisations.
The Commission intends to present the results of this consultation in spring 2008, together with the fifth progress report on economic and social cohesion.
On the basis of this and other own-initiative reports recently approved, I am very much looking forward to Parliament's contribution to this debate.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Madam President, Mr PotoÄnik, ladies and gentlemen, the differences between the poor and the rich regions of the Community are truly enormous.
These regional differences are more apparent in today's enlarged European Union than they were in the original fifteen.
There may be various reasons for this, such as geographical location, the type of residential infrastructure, the sector-by-sector structure of the economy, the stratification of society or other reasons relating to the history of a given area.
These differences can be smoothed out to some extent through structural policies, but we will always have richer and poorer regions.
In my view it is therefore very important to aim chiefly for a situation where all of the regions in the European Union have more or less achieved definite economic progress and social development.
We should target structural funds at clearly boosting GDP growth, increasing employment and contributing to sustainable development.
In this regard, I would ask the following questions.
What were the structural measures that contributed to the growth of successful regions such as Ireland?
What causes regions such as Mezzogiorno in Italy, where decades of structural funding have failed to bring about any major change, to continue to lag behind?
How can we make sure that European funds are not squandered in the present but invested for the future?
Ladies and gentlemen, I am not entirely sure that the report we are discussing today provides us with clear guidelines in this issue.
The fact of the matter is, however, that only by providing answers to the above questions can we prevent a repetition of the errors of the past in today's poorest regions, thereby ensuring that European funding will bring real added value to regional economies and societies.
It is, however, too soon to make a full assessment of the benefits that structural policies have brought to the poorest regions, because the poorest countries have only just joined the Union.
There is still a problem with the complexity of the overall structure.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, allow me also to congratulate you once again on your election yesterday and on your first session in the chair here in the Chamber.
I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly for this engrossing report, because at the end of the day we all have the one aim, namely to eliminate the disparities between the regions of the European Union.
That is not only in the interests of the poorest regions of the European Union but in the interests of all regions, because the development of the Union as a whole would otherwise stagnate.
The fact is that we have huge potential in the regions we are supporting.
People there want to get involved and to play their part in the European Union, but we must also give them the opportunity to do so.
I would like to focus on a few points which the rapporteur mentioned in her report and which seem quite important to me.
The European Union needs to provide rapid assistance, which means that we must build up the administration and must not tread on each other's toes in the various tiers of government.
This also requires a functioning system of cross-border cooperation.
I am eager to see how the Member States actually achieve that aim in the coming weeks and months.
I would be delighted if the new financial instruments, Jessica, Jeremy and Jasper, which were invented some years ago, finally became familiar in the Member States and were used to good effect.
Of more than 400 applications submitted so far for operational programmes, however, a quarter at most have been approved.
I would be pleased if that went more quickly; perhaps it could incorporate scope for subsequent adjustment.
There is one thing I would like to stress: getting rid of disparities between regions also means working to eliminate differences in the opportunities available to men and women.
I therefore urge the House to support the relevant motions here in plenary.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, like my fellow Member, Mrs Krehl, I congratulate you on your election and on your first sitting as President.
Commissioner PotoÄnik, I should like to say to you that this report, which has been presented exceedingly well by our fellow Member, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, is first and foremost a cry from the heart.
Next, it is a necessity for the European Union, as Mrs Krehl just said, and it is an appeal to the Commission.
It is a cry from the heart because the development of poor regions is not just about the development of regions but about the taking account of the situations - tragic situations in some cases - of people who are unemployed or who have to move, etc. It is therefore a human cry from the heart.
It is also a necessity - the report explains this well - where the development of the European Union is concerned.
That being said, Commissioner, we need to go further, and please do not regard my remark as a criticism, but as an observation; you yourself made various observations, in six minutes or so, culminating in these words: 'I await proposals from Parliament'.
Well, in the report by our fellow Member, there are a number of proposals.
What I would like to convey in these few seconds granted to me is that we need clarification from the Commission, today, on the following: who does what, when and how?
Who?
What is the European Union's role?
I believe that, until now, we have for the most part successfully laid down the conditions in terms of funding, regulations and so on. The report by our fellow Member contains some additional initiatives relating in particular to financial aspects, to technical assistance aspects, etc., with the aim of strengthening the pivotal role played by the Commission and of putting it in a stronger position to make proposals and to provide assistance.
But then, nothing, or almost nothing, is said about the role played by the Member States.
The fact is, if we want to help regions in difficulty, it is not enough to say 'there are European funds', it also requires the Member States to assume their responsibilities.
At this level, the Commission cannot impose things, given the constraints of the subsidiarity principle.
However, in the light of what has taken place in Ireland and in the south of Italy, etc., some observations and suggestions can be made.
I must say that, yesterday, I myself actually hosted some mayors of very small local councils of disadvantaged regions, and it is down to them to build projects - they just need to be told how to do so.
To conclude, Commissioner, what I personally expect, in addition to what is given in the report by our fellow Member, is that the Commission does as it should do and clearly indicates to us who does what, and how.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I, too, congratulate you on your new office, Madam President.
One reform leads to another.
That was the reason why we in the Committee on Regional Development, immediately after the reform of the Structural Fund and for the umpteenth time, asked the question how we were to assess Europe's poorest regions in future.
The aim was to give the cohesion policy a future in the light of present-day experience with regard to the new reform of the Structural Funds in 2014, for we know that the willingness of the wealthy Member States to pay into the Solidarity Pact is waning.
At the same time, our common commitment to the poorest regions through the cohesion policy is the very thing that keeps the heart of the European Union beating.
Unfortunately, this report hardly deals with these issues concerning the future.
It concentrates on the implementation problems in the new Member States in connection with the current Structural Funds Regulation.
It illustrates what happens when a solid decentralised administrative structure is considered expendable.
I regard it as naive, however, to believe that banks are a substitute for a greater degree of involvement as a panacea for the absorption and administration problems in the very poorest regions.
The Jasper and Jessica initiatives must be used in such a way that democratic action is not abandoned and that the public purse is not saddled with debts for generations to come.
This would mean the European Union keeping the poorest regions permanently on life support, and that cannot be our intention.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) I would firstly like to commend the rapporteur for her own-initiative report, which underlines some aspects that we consider important, although we disagree with others, namely with regard to the debate on the future of the cohesion policy and the fourth report on the economic and social cohesion of the European Union.
It is necessary here to stress that disparities, in particular regional ones, have increased dramatically with the successive rounds of EU enlargement, that the increase in regional disparities and the growth in the effects of polarisation at an internal level in each country has been proven, and that, in general terms, there is still a rich centre and a poor periphery, which has now been further expanded.
By stressing these aspects we seek to make a clear case for the existence of a strong regional policy as an essential tool for the reduction of disparities and the promotion of real, as opposed to nominal, convergence in the poorest regions of the European Union.
A strong regional cohesion policy is all the more necessary with the heightened costs of the internal market, the policy of liberalisation of markets and competition, and European and Monetary Union, as well as of the euro and its Stability Pact for the poorest regions of the European Union.
It is essential that the regional cohesion policy is strengthened, with the much-vaunted social and economic cohesion and real convergence set as a central objective and policy of the European Union, reinforcing the redistributive role of the community budget and providing adequate funding so that the objectives proposed may effectively be achieved.
If regional cohesion policy is to be effective then acts that detract from its value, such as the diversion of its funds to finance other policies and priorities which in no way contribute to achieving the objectives previously expressed, must be rejected.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (EL) Madam President, can you imagine a family setting the table at home for lunch, with lobster for the father, salmon for the mother, meat for one child, beans for another child, greens for another child and nothing for the other child?
It simply cannot be and yet that is what is happening in the big European family, which we want to unite under one Constitution.
There are 80 million citizens in Europe living below the poverty line.
There are pensioners in Greece living on EUR 300 a month and they feel just fine, because in neighbouring countries other pensioners are living on EUR 80.
This is the policy of Europe.
Certain inaccessible areas in Greece, such as Ipiros, or certain other isolated islands near Turkey have suddenly become rich, precisely because the new incoming countries have brought down the average.
This is not logical.
We must find a way of developing the economy equally for everyone.
When there is a racist attitude on the part of the ministers who create the economy, such as the Minister of Finance, Mr Alogoskoufis, who the other day said that blacks are not people, repulsively and insultingly referring to them as 'niggers'; when they have this sort of racist attitude, they cannot impose an economy of equality, an economy which will be developed throughout the world.
Poor people have the right to life and we must find solutions.
We are not going to measure standards in Europe by how many people drive a Mercedes 500, but by how many children do not have a glass of milk to drink in the morning.
(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, since 2004, economic growth in the new Member States has been in the order of 5.3%, which is 2% higher than in the old Member States.
Export levels have doubled.
Investments are increasing considerably.
These results, which, as Mr PotoÄnik stated a moment ago, are emphatically and demonstrably underpinned by cohesion policy, are excellent.
Statistically speaking, the number of poor regions is declining.
Having said this, the regional differences in the Member States themselves are still massive.
The Geringer de Oedenberg report is right to draw attention to this.
I also notice that we have to be more critical of the commitment in the Member States themselves.
Too much concentration in central, urban regions does not do much to further the cause of peripheral regions.
The Member States too, together with the European Union, must opt in favour of a territorial approach towards their cohesion policy.
When effectiveness is under scrutiny, we should make far more political assessments of the national plans that are submitted.
Far more political because, ultimately, we fail to accelerate the economic development and cohesion in poor regions.
A reassessment is therefore called for.
A fourth cohesion report offers the framework in which this can be discussed.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will need to help take the lead in this.
On 8 November, we will be organising a hearing on this in this House.
By way of conclusion, I should like to say that there are good results, good opportunities for cohesion policy, provided we focus more on synergy at European, national and regional level for the benefit of these poorer regions and resist a multi-speed Europe.
Poorer regions, too, must find their rightful place in the knowledge economy and globalisation.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg on her excellent report.
These regions face a dual challenge in the implementation of the EU regional policy to absorb properly the allocated funds and to achieve the outcomes which are set in the aims for economic and social cohesion.
Special measures for these regions should be taken by the European Commission, governments and local authorities at all levels in order to achieve the best results for the citizens and the whole economic sector.
What is mainly needed is specific technical support that will focus on the development of administrative capacity and improvement of coordination between management bodies at state and local levels.
Otherwise, I agree with the Commissioner.
Specific tailor-made solutions are needed reducing the institutional, administrative and economic shortcomings of these regions will increase the efficiency of EU financial assistance as a whole.
The poorest regions must be encouraged to elaborate integrated plans for development as national documents which could serve as a basis for relating their specific features and potential.
The Member States should be encouraged to improve the legislative framework in the field of public-private partnerships, making it a good basis for simple and transparent rules.
But what the institution and the beneficiaries of these different programmes, including in my own country Bulgaria, need most is an even more active exchange of good practices, mainly amongst the new Member States, know-how transfer towards the central, regional and lowest possible local administrations and organisation of specific training on the whole cycle of project-making and implementation.
There are four key elements we should keep in mind: convergence, assistance, capacity for financial absorption and simplification of the rules.
To conclude, all measures in the report are very important, including, of course, equal rights for men and women, which is a serious problem in these regions.
I fully support the initiative for the adoption of a resolution specifically directed at the poorest EU regions.
(PL) Madam President, the fourth report on cohesion, recently published by the Commission, confirms that developmental disparities between the richest and the poorest regions in Europe are decreasing, something which was noted earlier.
Assuming that the strongest regions maintain a high, steady rate of economic growth, consolidated by a great deal of investment in innovation, we have to conclude that the weakest regions are displaying an increased rate of growth, allowing them to not only avoid lagging further behind, but even to make significant progress in terms of catching up.
These facts also confirm the theory concerning the effectiveness of the European Union's cohesion policy and the need to manage and develop it during the next programming periods.
The report we are discussing concerns the poorest regions in the European Union not the poorest regions in the Member States, which are often relatively rich, on a European scale.
Inter-regional disparities at a national level mainly fall within the remit of the national authorities and dealing with them should, especially in the so-called cohesion countries, be supported through European intervention.
A separate and courageous political decision needs to be taken to define what regions we consider to be the poorest and which require specific action to promote development.
Let us remember that the Treaty provisions mention disparities between regions and that cohesion policy needs to cover not only the poorest regions in terms of per capita GDP, but also regions that have fallen behind others in terms of the level of innovation, development of a knowledge-based economy, attractiveness in relation to investment, geographical location and others.
Certain disparities may decrease with economic growth and a deeper common market, but new ones will appear.
Cohesion policy has never been, and is not, a charitable activity and has to remain a flexible intervention tool for the European Union.
(EL) Madam President, today, seven months after the start of the fourth programming period, and in the run-up to the debate on the future of political cohesion, the European Parliament emphasises in this report, on which I congratulate the rapporteur, that there is no room for failure in the new programming period.
Cohesion policy must not only achieve the objectives it has set and strengthen growth and employment in the poorer regions; it must also manage to make its results visible, perceptible and acceptable to everyone at all levels.
Giving grants and earmarking funds alone does not guarantee proper use of resources or a reduction in the current widespread inequalities between the European regions.
Proper use requires coordination and participation at all levels.
We are going through a period of acute economic changes and challenges.
We must protect and promote the policy that puts solidarity and cohesion into practice and strengthen its efficacy.
This report contains important recommendations in this direction.
Let us make use of them.
(HU) First of all, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur for this highly successful, excellent report.
In order for the developments to take place in the regions that truly need them most, we need to take account of their distinctive features.
It is evident that in the initial phase, inequalities within the countries showed an increase.
Growth on a national average can be said to be good, although it is concentrated in the capital and in urban regions.
Meanwhile, in the typically rural, village areas, there is increasing poverty and classic ghettoes have emerged.
This problem far surpasses the potential for rural development, and therefore any hope for change can be based only on deliberate harmonisation of the foundations and on complex developments.
For this reason I consider it necessary to give priority to rural areas.
Similarly, greater emphasis must be placed on helping minorities catch up, and on the training and retraining programmes related to this goal.
Further, I consider it important to increase the absorption capacity of the new Member States, and to further expand the technical aid that this demands.
It is in this way that integration can become a tool for integrating the Europe of the regions.
(PT) Madam President, Mrs de Oedenberg's report is not only excellent, resulting from her complete openness and ability to negotiate consensuses, but also highlights the strong regional disparities that exist throughout Europe, both in the new Member States and in the old ones, where a large part of the regions found themselves excluded from the group of poorest regions purely on the grounds of statistics that are not always complete or adequately compared and that, therefore, need to be improved.
Coming, as I do, from an ultra-peripheral region, the island of Madeira, I have made several contributions with the following aims: guaranteeing the adaptation of the cohesion policy to the outermost regions, as mentioned in Article 29, section 2; achieving a clearer definition of the criteria for defining which regions are rich and which are poor; and reinforcing research and education as the path to development, because the regions in question need to find an effective way out of the situation in which they find themselves.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, without any doubt the poorest regions of Europe need attention.
Some regions in Europe need special attention, for example, regions at a statistical disadvantage, the outermost and isolated regions and cities.
It is important to focus on restructuring structural assistance and to pay more attention to the Lisbon goals of innovation, research and development, as these are activities which will create a solid base for the future economies of those regions.
We should also pay heed to lowering energy consumption through renewable energies, which will provide a solid basis for the sustainable future of the relevant countries.
Gender mainstreaming is a horizontal principle that we will follow in all our actions undertaken under all the structural funds.
Absorption capacity is something on which we are focusing constantly.
All this has received, and will continue to receive, constant attention.
Solidarity with the poorest in Europe is the backbone of the European Union, especially after the two recent enlargements.
We should not deny the problems, but we should not forget the good results we have achieved in the past.
It is important to talk about both successes and problems, because this is a way of securing even greater recognition for cohesion policy and eliminating future problems.
I should like thank you for the excellent Geringer report, your comments and your critical remarks.
It is our duty to address the problems of the poorest in Europe.
The Commission will certainly focus on that.
Solidarity should remain one of the areas where we show the human face of Europe as a whole.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at voting time, in a few minutes' time.
Ladies and gentlemen, the sooner we vote, the sooner you can start your well-earned recess.
But of course there is still this afternoon's sitting to come.
I must ask our honourable colleague Robert Atkins to ensure next time that the Members are all here punctually.
Mr President, on a point of order, I am sure that Sir Robert will be delighted to do that if you can ensure that we will start on time!
Your remarks do not apply today, Mr Wise, because Sir Robert has not yet been able to ensure that the ladies and gentlemen of the House toe the line, although he will surely try to do so in future.
We shall then be able to judge each other fairly and objectively.
Mr President, I am sure that if whoever was in the Chair started on time, Members would soon realise that they had to be here on time!
(Applause)
Mr President, many of us were very envious of your skill in extricating yourself from the Chair at lunchtime yesterday.
When we stayed here voting, you went away for lunch.
Are you going to do the same today?
(Laughter)
I do not know, Mr Chichester, whether you aspire to the office of President of the European Parliament.
Should you be President one day, you will realise that my purpose was not so much to go for a meal as to fulfil numerous obligations.

Community Statistical Programme (2008-2012) (vote)

Darfur (vote)
- Motion for a resolution
- Before the vote:
(ES) Mr President, this resolution is brought to plenary under Rule 91, as a result of urgency, without debate.
It is certainly urgent and on my own behalf and on behalf of the five Members who have spent five days in Darfur, I would like very briefly to point out the reasons for this urgency.
Darfur today is a lawless territory, in which everybody is waging war against everybody else.
The great problems of our times are condensed there: the conflict between central and peripheral areas, ethnic conflicts, the cynical exploitation of rivalries between groups for political purposes, and perhaps the first war in the world to be caused by climate change.
But it is urgent because security is deteriorating even further, and if that continues, humanitarian workers will not be able to carry on doing their work. The fate of two and a half million people depends on that work, since they are fed each day thanks to their efforts, and partly thanks to European Union money.
If there is no improvement in security between now and the end of the year, we may find that two million people have been abandoned to their fate in the desert, in danger of creating the greatest humanitarian crisis the world has ever seen.
It is therefore important, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that United Nations forces, which we have asked to be sent to Darfur so many times, finally go, now that the Sudanese Government has no objection.
The Sudanese Government is no longer saying no.
It is now saying yes.
It says that they should go as soon as possible, because it is no longer capable - as if it ever wanted to - of guaranteeing the least security.
The Janjaweed have not been disarmed.
Quite the opposite.
The Sudanese Government is not going to increase security in Darfur.
If we want to avoid the risk of total humanitarian crisis, we must exert pressure in order to ensure that that force gets there as soon as possible.
However, since it will take at least a year to get there, we must support the African Union and we must at least ensure that its soldiers are paid, because you should be aware that we have spent more money on supporting that force than on humanitarian aid.
Those are the reasons for the urgency, Mr President.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Josep Borrell, for this report and for your untiring commitment.

Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union (vote)
- Piecyk report
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - (DE) I beg to point out that Amendment 1 should not be placed after paragraph 4 but after paragraph 146; that was agreed with the author of the amendment.
This paragraph does not belong at the beginning but at the end of the resolution.
I would be grateful if you could arrange for that to be done.
Our efficient staff have already seen to that.

PNR agreement with the United States of America (vote)
- Joint motion for a resolution
- Before the vote on citation 4:
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the four oral amendments we moved are a last attempt to obtain a joint resolution.
Let me make it clear, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we endorse the criticism.
Criticism alone, however, will not stop the terrorists.
That is why we want to add a constructive dimension to this resolution.
Accordingly, we move firstly that the following specific wording be added:
'Having regard to the joint ruling of the European Court of Justice of 30 May 2006 on cases C-317/04 and C-318/04,'
(DE) In this way we want to include a serious reference to the ruling that we ourselves in Parliament applied pressure to obtain.
That is the first oral amendment I ask the House to support.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on citation 6:
(DE) The addition at this point would be as follows:
'... and the responses he received from Minister Dr Wolfgang SchÃ€uble and Commission Director-General JLS Jonathan Faull of 29 June and 3 July 2007,'
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- After recital A:
- (DE) Then we are moving that another recital be added, as follows:
'whereas the PNR agreement is meant to help prevent and combat terrorism and international crime,'
(The oral amendment was accepted)
- After recital B:
Mr President, I should like to move the following oral amendment: 'whereas the PNR agreement provides the legal framework for the transfer of EU PNR data to the US and, by doing so, provides a basis for the air carriers to operate their business with the US,'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)

Situation in Pakistan (vote)
- Joint motion for a resolution
- Before the vote on paragraph 1:
Mr President, I apologise for this, but colleagues will recognise that this situation is changing daily and the oral amendment is not quite the same as that listed on some people's sheets so I will read it out: 'Expresses its solidarity with the people of Pakistan who are victims of the violence perpetrated by the armed extremists; is deeply concerned for the safety of the 1800 or more people in the Red Mosque, some of whom were held as hostages; recognises the challenges the siege posed to the Government of Pakistan; expresses its grave concern about the still unknown number of victims and supports the efforts to bring those responsible to justice'.
(DE) Since the storming of the Red Mosque has now been carried out, should we not use the past tense, at least in the second part?
(The oral amendment was accepted)
12.
2006 Progress Report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (vote)
- Meijer report
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, at the start of the vote on my report, I have to inform the House of two issues.
First, when the vote was being prepared in the AFET Committee, all political groups agreed to use in this report only one term for the state which calls itself the Republic of Macedonia.
It is the long sentence 'Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', without any abbreviation, such as the English FYROM or the French ARYM.
I therefore propose that if parts of the final adopted text include any other terms, those terms should be replaced on the basis of this broad agreement.
Secondly, the PPE-DE Group proposed that I should merge two amendments on paragraph 13 into one - my amendment 22 and the PSE amendment 6.
With this is mind, I should like to move an oral amendment to my amendment 22.
As the vote on amendment 22 is due to be taken after the vote on amendment 6, this solution is only possible if amendment 6 is rejected.
I should therefore like to ask that the order of voting on the amendments be changed.
Mr Pinior of the PSE Group said yesterday evening that he would be in favour of this arrangement.
I hope everyone understood that correctly.
In that case we shall do as you request.

(DE) Mr President, it is with a heavy heart that I move this compromise amendment, but it may be the key to a clear majority.
At the end of the amendment, after 'open the corresponding process', should be added the words 'including the possibility of membership'.
(The oral amendment was accepted)
(DE) The revised Amendment 6 has been withdrawn.
(DE) Then paragraph 11 will stay as it was.

The humanitarian situation of Iraqi refugees
The next item is the debate on the six motions for a resolution on the humanitarian situation of Iraqi refugees.
author. - Mr President, Commissioner, Iraq is today in a catastrophic abyss and the Iraqi people find themselves in a state of utter despair and shock.
The confirmed statistics provided by international agencies, such as the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq and other UN organisations, are truly grim and heartbreaking.
Every day on average one hundred people are killed and two hundred wounded; 50% of the population is living on less than one dollar a day and unemployment affects more than 80% of the population.
Only a minority have access to adequate water supplies and effective sanitation.
Electricity supply is severely restricted and is subject to frequent interruptions without warning.
Four out of five doctors have left their hospitals and three out of four children are not at school.
Almost three million people are internally displaced, i.e. they are refugees in their own country, and this number increases by about 2000 every day.
A further two million Iraqis are refugees in neighbouring states, namely Syria, Jordan, the Gulf region, Egypt and Iran.
These people have no formal refugee protection status.
The EU and the international community in general have a moral duty to show compassion and understanding for the miserable circumstances the Iraqi refugees find themselves in.
Additionally, and more importantly, they must take much more effective measures to ensure that these poor people are given the help and support they so desperately need in order to survive indignity and the calamity that has fallen upon them.
This joint motion for a resolution lists a number of measures that are of importance in helping the Iraqi refugees have a more human existence.
So far, I have spoken as a representative of my group, now permit me to say a few words on a personal basis.
Iraq is a relatively new country: it only became independent from Britain in 1932.
It then followed a history of turmoil and, eventually, Saddam Hussein came to power.
He was a tyrant and a criminal but he was assisted in gaining power by the West, including, unfortunately, some European states.
Sadly, though, even the worst days of Saddam Hussein's totalitarian rule seem nothing in comparison to the death, destruction and suffering that has fallen on the Iraqi people following the Bush-Blair invasion and continued occupation of the country.
These two 'peacekeepers' ordered an attack on Iraq, promising to bring happiness and prosperity to the Iraqi people.
Instead, they succeeded in bringing a calamity of gigantic proportions.
Yet some EU circles continue to applaud this invasion and, recently, they have even agreed to rewarding Mr Blair for his 'peace' services to the Arab world by appointing him Special Representative of the Quartet to the Middle East.
May God bring some sanity to such circles and may God save us from the Bushes and Blairs of this world !
deputising for the author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I shall read Tobias PflÃŒger's speech. 'Sadly, not until today have we held a debate on assistance for the Iraqi refugees.
I deeply regret that.
Why did the liberal, right-wing nationalist and conservative groups drop the subject from the agenda of the last plenary part-session?
Instead, the House engaged in ideological debates about Cuba.
The situation in Iraq is desperate.
Since the US invasion and the formation of the so-called 'coalition of the willing', more than 600 000 people have been killed.
More than two million Iraqis have fled the country.
To these may be added two million within the country who have been driven from their homes and more than 40 000 non-Iraqi refugees.
The number of US service personnel who have lost their lives rises daily and has now reached 3 600.
Regrettably, through their participation in the war and their support of the war, Member States of the EU - and Germany is one of the foremost culprits - bear a substantial share of responsibility for the situation in Iraq.
Real help must now be given to the refugees.
That cannot be the task of the neighbouring countries alone.
The EU must commit funds for this purpose.
Deportations to Iraq must be brought to an immediate halt.
The troops of the United States and its allies in the so-called coalition of the willing must be withdrawn.
EU Member States must stop supporting the war.
An end to the illegal war and the occupation of Iraq is imperative.
author. - Mr President, I was one of those politicians who supported the Iraq war back in 2003 in the belief that Saddam Hussein posed a serious long-term risk to regional stability, but also because of the horrendous brutality of his Baathist regime.
I believed this would be replaced by democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law.
But I, like many others, sadly underestimated the ferocity of the subsequent insurgency and the serious lack of peace planning, post-invasion, by our US allies, in particular their disastrous dismantling of the Iraqi army as a de-Baathification measure, which unleashed disgruntled Sunni officers to lend their expertise to the insurgency.
There was also a failure to secure the Jordanian and Syrian borders against jihadi extremists flocking in to have a bash at the allies, not to mention that Saddam opened his jails before his fall, which added organised crime to this lethal cocktail, and always with the fingers of Iran meddling on the side of the Shias in what has now become virtually a civil war.
Curiously, immediately after the invasion, there was little in the way of internally displaced persons or refugees compared to the previous exodus of Kurds in the Saddam days.
Paradoxically, the Kurdish flow has now stopped, as this is one of the few remaining peaceful areas of the country.
Sadly, in the last two years, huge numbers of Iraqis - perhaps over two million - have left, particularly the long-suffering, persecuted Christian Assyrian minorities who have been squeezed on all sides by Islamists, who accuse them of collaborating with the crusaders, and by the Kurds, who want their lands.
Canon Andrew White, who ran Iraq's only Anglican Church, left Baghdad yesterday amid fears for his life and safety after trying to secure the release of five kidnapped Britons.
But the EU must now do more to alleviate the crisis by boosting financial aid to the surrounding Arab states, which have received the bulk of the refugees, in particular Jordan and Syria, and they have been particularly good at taking in the Assyrians.
The EU Member States must also accept, within reason, more refugees on a temporary basis.
author. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Iraqi brothers and sisters, an initial word in memory of all those who have been deprived of their most precious asset because of their ethnic or religious origin, their real or presumed convictions, or for being a symbol of democratic courage and public spirit.
Allow me to put the spotlight on my comrade, companion and friend, the Member of Parliament Mohammad Hossein Ahwad, the very embodiment of the fight against theocratic fascism, who was assassinated on 12 April in the Iraqi parliament.
In order that the blinding tears of pain do not prevent us from seeing those women who still fight to keep their children alive on the pathways of ethnic cleansing, the countless thousands of Iraqis gazing into infinity on the streets of Amman, Damascus and Cairo, profoundly affected victims of post-traumatic syndromes, the camps set up in squares or in the buttresses of ruined churches or mosques, I would like to send a message of solidarity, love, affection and hope to all.
We cannot begin to imagine, nor can these words express, the barbarity of the forces of darkness who rehearsed their plan for the entire greater Middle East on the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates.
The common resolution which we now put forward is a vital first step towards reversing the situation.
author. - Mr President, I welcome the resolution and, like others, I am really concerned about the truly tragic situation that we see in Iraq and on its borders at the moment.
This is a people that have already suffered war, ethnic cleansing, a brutal dictatorship, an illegal invasion and communal violence, and are now seeing borders closing both externally and internally, seeing little chance of resettlement, and seeing a very mixed reception should any of them make it to the European Union.
We should not be surprised when war produces refugees - it always does - and indeed, as has already been said, some of our Member States have a very grave responsibility for that situation.
I would agree, for once, with Mr Tannock, certainly on the question of the lack of post-war planning.
I particularly welcome, in this resolution, the statement that there should be no forced return of Iraqi refugees, or of those who have had their claims turned down that are currently living in the European Union, and at present we certainly need to find a status for such people, rather than leaving them destitute in our own Member States, as is happening in some places.
I would say that there is no part of Iraq which is currently safe.
Even in Kurdistan we see Turkish troops at the moment massing on the borders there, undermining the possibility of return to destroyed villages and undermining efforts to increase economic stability in that area.
Indeed, some of those that have been returned were sent back wearing flak jackets and helmets, which, to me, says it is not exactly a safe area.
We also had a report from Human Rights Watch only last week saying that, despite the efforts of authorities in Kurdistan, partisan security forces continue the practice of kidnap and torture, so there is no real safe area in Iraq.
We know that we have to increase our support to the countries dealing with refugees on the border, and to the UNHCR, because we know what happens when you ignore the plight of refugees at the border.
We only have to look at our experience when we more or less turned our back on two million Afghan refugees on the Pakistani border and left them without adequate support - that vacuum is filled, and we do not always like the result.
I welcome the call, in the resolution, for the Commission to explain to Parliament's Committee on Budgets in more detail exactly how we are helping in Iraq and how we are aiming to support those surrounding countries.
But, equally, I think we should be looking at our own resettlement policies to at least offer assistance to some of those who, once again, are finding their lives absolutely in turmoil.
author. - (PL) Mr President, the humanitarian and human rights situation in Iraq is constantly deteriorating.
This is what the reports of the UN aid mission to Iraq reveal.
The statistics are horrifying.
On average, around one hundred people die every day and over two hundred are injured.
50% of the population live on less than a dollar a day and the unemployment rate stands at 80%.
There are insufficient water supplies and the sewage systems are inefficient, which encourages the spread of disease.
Three quarters of children do not attend school.
Criminal activity, armed attacks, kidnappings, killings of people involved in political activities or rebuilding the country are all everyday occurrences.
That is why many Iraqis flee their country and over two million people have become internally displaced.
It should also be highlighted that there are over forty thousand refugees from other countries on Iraqi soil, including fifteen thousand Palestinians.
This is what Iraq looks like today.
We therefore need immediate political and humanitarian action in order to alleviate the tragic situation faced by the refugees.
We should remember that half a million of the refugees are children.
We should ensure that internally displaced people are registered, which will give them the right to obtain food rations.
Today, they are denied this right.
We should also exert influence on neighbouring countries, so that they cease to place entry restrictions on the refugees, thus forcing many to remain on the borders.
The Union must make sure that the aid we send to Iraq, to the Iraqi people, is comprehensive, sustainable and coordinated with the actions of the United States.
The Union should, once and for all, reject anti-American prejudice.
It is the only way in which we will be able to relieve the incredibly difficult situation faced by millions of refugees and therefore avoid a large-scale humanitarian crisis.
We also call on the Iraqi Government to take immediate action to ensure the safety of displaced people and to cease to discriminate against people on the basis of their background.
The European Commission, meanwhile, should increase humanitarian aid to all displaced people in Iraq and provide support to neighbouring countries that already provide this kind of aid.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FI) Mr President, the plight of the Iraqi refugees is still a serious one, except for one move in the right direction.
The recommendation by the UN's main delegate for refugee affairs to give refugee status to the asylum seekers of southern and central Iraq under the 1951 Convention was a welcome solution. As is the offer of additional forms of protection in cases where refugee status is not given.
I wish to raise two matters in particular, from within Iraq's borders.
Firstly, the status of religious minorities is becoming ever more intolerable.
Assyrian, Armenian, Orthodox and other Christian groups, as well as Mandaeans and Jews are being glaringly discriminated against in the labour market and elsewhere.
In certain areas the authorities are totally incapable of protecting minorities from violence inflicted by Muslim soldiers.
Freedom of religion is in fact virtually non-existent.
Secondly, I find incredible the threats which the Iraqi authorities have made to freeze the supply of vital goods to Iranian refugees.
These members of the opposition have refugee status under international law and an inalienable right to protection.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we must admit that what is happening and what has happened in Iraq is much worse than civil war - a question that is often posed.
Of course, there is not civil war.
It is worse.
There is total chaos.
Nobody has any idea or any plan as to how to unravel the mess we put Iraq in.
I use the word 'put' because what went on was not needed, not required, nor was it wanted.
It was an invasion which has proved a terrible nightmare for those who have participated in it.
When one makes a mistake, one has to carry the responsibility for it.
It is about time that those people who participated, those countries in the coalition as well as the willing partners, show responsibility for what has happened to the Iraqi people, especially the refugees who are seeking help - even if they find any help, they find only a minimum amount.
It is about time that those people who made the initial mistake, who are responsible for the chaotic situation, show that responsibility and the first people who should be helped are the refugees.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, almost hidden amongst the constant news of violence in Iraq is the almost unheard voice of Iraq's Christian minority.
This small population has no protection and is almost unknown to the international community.
They are experiencing intense waves of violent persecution.
Christian Iraqis are faced with the choice of exile - if they can manage to escape - conversion or persecution.
The persecution takes many forms: violence, discrimination in the workplace, confiscation of property, etc. For a Chaldean Christian priest, Ragheed Aziz Ganni, this persecution resulted in death.
What will the European Community do to help the Chaldean, Assyrian and Orthodox Christian communities?
The Iraqi Government states its commitment to ending violence, but the lack of security makes it impossible to enforce peace on the ground and impossible to protect vulnerable populations.
They need our help.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, it is a good thing to table a resolution on Iraq for the sake of the humanitarian situation, refugees, international aid and so on. Who would not agree, moreover, with recital A and its finding that 100 people are killed and 200 are wounded each day, 70% of the population is without water, 3 million people are undernourished and 2 million are refugees, including 500 000 children in Syria, Jordan, Egypt and elsewhere?
Who has done this, though?
Who is responsible?
Who has spread chaos?
Is it Saddam Hussein? Is it the Ba'ath Party?
Chaos stems from war, an unjust war in the eyes of the theologians of the Middle Ages, an illegal war according to the UN Charter, a war started on the back of a lie told by two Heads of State, those of the US and the United Kingdom.
Who supported this war, here, in the European Parliament?
Who justified, who requested, who approved the intervention that led to chaos?
The current French foreign affairs minister, Mr Kouchner, and some of the signatories to this resolution did.
What are we supposed to say?
That it is good to be humanitarian and to deal with the effects, but that it is better to be preventive and to avert the causes?
This is the problem of political Europe!
In Europe we are so fond of human rights that, everywhere - in Palestine, in Iraq, in Africa, in the field of economic globalisation - we support policies that, violating as they do these human rights, enable us to reaffirm our immense love of these very human rights, which are ultimately violated with our prior support.
It is therefore good that post-trauma centres for refugees are being proposed in paragraph 16, but provision must also be made for political prevention centres, here, for our leaders, so that they can be taught wisdom, lucidity and the courage to say 'no', and taught to reject naÃ¯ve optimism, which destroys everything in its wake.
(LT) I support the resolution, and I sympathise with more than four million Iraqis who have been forced to flee from their birthplaces.
That is more people than there are in my homeland, Lithuania.
The number of refugees is growing, and half of them are forced to flee abroad. The situation in Iraq is not improving.
The refugees are condemned to vegetate in poverty, usually without employment, while their children grow up illiterate.
For these reasons, terrorist organisations are able to successfully recruit followers.
Humanitarian assistance for refugees is shamefully small compared to the amount spent on weapons by the USA and UK, the countries that launched the war on Iraq.
The 60 million US dollars contributed by donors in the USA is just a drop in the ocean.
This year about 40 000 refugees from Iraq will arrive in European Union countries - twice as many as last year - while the USA has accepted barely a several dozen Iraqis this year.
It would be good for US and UK leaders to visit Iraq and neighbouring countries and see with their own eyes the suffering of the refugees.
Maybe then they would behave differently.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the security deterioration in Iraq has provoked a large scale displacement: approximately two million Iraqis have fled within the borders of Iraq and approximately two million into the neighbouring countries, with 750 000 people in Jordan and 1.4 million people in Syria.
This displacement may result in a humanitarian crisis, and could present a threat to regional stability and the Commission is extremely concerned about the scale of human suffering.
We are following the situation closely on the ground and constantly reviewing any developments.
We are in close contact with other key players of the international community, such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
In this regard, the Commission has actively participated at the UNHCR International Conference last April in Geneva.
In terms of existing assistance, in order to alleviate the difficulties of the displaced, the Commission, via EuropeAid, allocated EUR 10 million in 2006 to support internally displaced persons.
In February 2007, as a rapid response to the deteriorating situation and following the UNHCR appeal in January, the Commission, via ECHO, announced an additional allocation of EUR 10.2 million, composed of EUR 4 million for the internally displaced and EUR 6.2 million for the externally displaced Iraqis.
Furthermore, the Commission is continuing its support of the delivery of basic services inside Iraq.
We understand that this support remains limited in the face of the scale of human suffering.
Nevertheless, it constitutes only a first, immediate response to the humanitarian situation.
The Commission is currently looking at various options on how to better assist the Iraqi refugees in the future.
However, delivery of assistance inside Iraq is severely constrained by the security situation.
Many of our partners, including UNHCR, have only a very minimal presence in Iraq.
Through various technical and political missions, the Commission attempts to better assess the situation and, at the same time, convey its readiness to further support the Iraqi refugees.
Commissioner Michel visited the region himself at the end of April.
Several technical missions to Jordan and Syria have also followed since then.
We remain, therefore, committed to working with the countries that are accommodating Iraqi refugees.
The Commission has already and will retain regular discussions with the Syrian and Jordan authorities about the situation.
We are looking forward particularly to participate in the Sharm El-Sheikh agreed Working Group on Refugees, which, according to the latest indication, is scheduled to meet on 22 July in Amman.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has already expressed the Commission's readiness to provide technical assistance to the working group in order to facilitate the process.
We believe that the only durable solution for the refugees is peace and reconciliation inside Iraq.
Towards this end, we will continue our support to the Iraqi refugees.
I agree with you that we have a moral duty to help.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.

Human rights in Vietnam
The next item is the debate on the six draft resolutions on human rights in Vietnam.
author. - Mr President, Vietnam, a word synonymous with catastrophe, is a country that, as we all know, has had an extremely traumatic past, with long and treacherous fighting against colonialism, with a devastating civil conflict and with a calamitous war against the American forces having resulted in unprecedented suffering for the Vietnamese people.
Then came the totalitarian Communist regime which, it has to be said, has made at least some proper efforts towards healing the wounds of the past and getting the country on its feet again.
Consequently, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was rewarded by the international community in various ways, including being allowed it to join the World Trade Organisation, but, unfortunately, there is still a long way to go to achieving an acceptable level of democracy for the Vietnamese people.
We are particularly concerned about new waves of persecution of dissidents and the suppression of the fundamental right of free speech.
We are also very concerned about the lapses in reforms relating to freedom of religion and the various set-backs in achieving judicial reform, which should be fair and democratic and which should lead to the abolition of all forms of imprisonment without proper judicial safeguards.
Hoping that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Vietnam will, albeit the recent setbacks, lead to tangible improvements for the Vietnamese people, we call upon the authorities in Vietnam to take serious note of our concerns relating to the issue of violation of human rights in their country.
At the same time, we call upon the Commission and Council to reassess the policy of cooperation with Vietnam, bearing in mind that this cooperation should be subject to respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights and reforms.
Let this motion for a resolution not be seen as a threat, but more as a caution to the Vietnamese Government.
author. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I was chairman of the Vietnam Friendship Society in my country in the 1980s.
I see that there has been rapid economic development in the country, in the last 10 years especially.
The new generations speak of it: those who have no personal experience of US aggression in Vietnam.
As an old friend of Vietnam, I, along with the other groups in the European Parliament, want to focus attention on the need to respect human rights and freedom of organisation, expression and religion in the spirit of the UN declarations and conventions.
Our group's resolution calls for the release of Buddhist leaders Thich Huyen Quang and Thich Quang Don from what we consider to be groundless imprisonment.
We think that Vietnam should liberalise its policy on minorities.
The EU should also work to promote cooperation with Vietnam.
Although oil has been discovered in Vietnam, it is not a western oil and gas reserve, and so political rights and human rights may be brought to the fore, unlike, for example, when working with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
author. - (FI) Mr President, the situation in Vietnam warrants the attention of the international community.
The EU needs to send a clear message: discrimination against religious communities, such as the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam, its Protestant congregation and dissident groups, must cease.
Members of these communities, who practise their faith peacefully, have suffered detention and home arrest.
That was an extract from a speech I made four years ago in this House on human rights in Vietnam.
It is sad to realise I can make the same speech now, as the situation with regard to freedom of religion has not improved.
This may beg the question of the importance of these discussions, but there is no alternative.
We have to continue to put the pressure on and do all we can to attract international attention.
Moreover, there is some hope, because there have been small constitutional reforms in Vietnam, at least at the level of legislation.
We have to give credit for these things, and I hope that in four years' time we can say something more about it.
author. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before getting to the heart of the matter and talking about the resolution on Vietnam with which we are dealing today, I should like to make a point that I feel is important.
I am wondering how the urgent matters with which we deal here, in Parliament, are chosen.
Indeed, although I am not calling into question the urgency of the various problems posed in the countries about which we are speaking, it does seem to me that some countries are completely forgotten about when compared with others about which we have the chance to speak several times in one parliamentary term.
I shall take just one example - Colombia, with its many trade unionists who have been assassinated and its hostages who are living in increasingly difficult circumstances.
According to my research, although Colombia has been the subject of specific resolutions, not once since 2002 has it been an urgent matter; I find this extraordinary.
However, I have taken the floor today to speak about the situation in Vietnam.
Although it seems that 2006 was a year of political openness, one that made flexibility possible, it appears that freedom of worship is among the problems being reported to us by the NGOs.
It is important that Vietnam accommodates all the religions practised on its territory and permits its entire population to choose its form of worship.
Freedom of thought and freedom of speech must not under any circumstances be flouted, and the people of Vietnam, whoever they may be, must be able to express themselves by any means at their disposal, including wide circulation methods such as the Internet.
Despite the situation, I should also like to point out - perhaps going against what my fellow Member, Mrs Korhola, just said - that efforts have, all the same, been made in Vietnam.
This country has already made certain efforts, of which we have taken note, not least when we went there in 2006 with the ASEAN delegation.
