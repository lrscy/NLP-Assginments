The kind of breakdown you mention is not normally done in Community research projects, but I can forward your remarks to Commissioner Busquin.
Â Â  Several Members have requested the floor for supplementary questions, and furthermore they are all sitting together.
The first two to request the floor were Mr Purvis and MrÂ RÃŒbig.
Mr Posselt had also requested the floor, but you will be aware that only two can speak.
I am going to use chronological order, I have no other way; if any of you is willing not to put a question, then the other two may do so.
Â Â  I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he could confirm that the moratorium on research into using embryonic stem cells is about to be lifted, and that the Commission will be prepared to consider, and potentially fund, applications for research involving embryonic stem cells on the basis of Parliament's resolution of 19 November 2003, which he mentioned.
Â Â  . â This is an extremely sensitive dossier, which my colleague Mr Busquin has handled with great sensitivity and expertise, so I will be very careful with my replies.
According to the prepared replies, there are two parts here.
I shall continue in French.
Â Â  . â In accordance with that moratorium, research is permitted only on human embryonic stem cells which have been stored in banks or isolated in the form of cultures.
This moratorium is equivalent to a policy agreement between the Council and the Commission and has no legal value.
It comes to an end on 31 December 2003 and after that, in the absence of any new legislative text, the Commission is legally obliged to implement the Sixth Framework Programme which authorises this kind of research.
It will do so, particularly since it has received a very strong political signal from Parliament, which is in favour of this type of research.
Â Â  â Commissioner, it is not only Parliament that is divided over this issue, but also the Council.
There are even divergences in the criminal law provisions in different Member States.
Let me therefore ask once again: given that the Council cannot agree on this extremely important matter, and given that there is a blocking minority, can the Commission not decide to set the subject aside until the Council has reached agreement?
That is my first question.
My second question is whether you know why Commissioner Busquin never takes part in question time debates on this subject.
It is not the first time this has happened.
Â Â  Perhaps this second question, Mr Posselt, should be communicated to Mr Busquin in any event.
Â Â  . â Mr Busquin is very strongly present in the European Parliament and all Community institutions.
I personally have witnessed a great number of debates on this particular issue in which he personally had invested a great deal.
I undertake to give the honourable Member a reply on this issue later on this week.
I want to ensure we are precise when we are talking about sensitive legal issues.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your cooperation, Mr Liikanen.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission does not intend to present a proposal on the prohibition of night flights at Community level, for various reasons.
Firstly, the situation with regard to acoustic pollution is not the same in all European airports.
Some have to confront the negative impact of noise emissions â being located in residential areas and given the density of traffic â circumstances which do not arise in other airports, or to a lesser extent.
Bearing in mind that the introduction of the prohibition of night flights has repercussions for the economy and employment, we must carefully consider the balance between the various elements, which obliges us to carry out a case-by-case cost-benefit study for each airport, before imposing such a prohibition.
Secondly, unilateral measures may isolate Europe from the international aviation network; the night-time closure of all European Union airports may constitute a serious obstacle to the normal functioning of that international network.
In many cases, it is inevitable that flights take place at night, particularly inter-continental flights, in view of the existence of different international time zones and types of cargo.
The Commission is monitoring noise problems, however, and their impact on citizens living close to airports.
The Commission therefore has insisted systematically, within the international context of the ICAO, that decisions should be adopted allowing us to provide solutions to deal with the specific needs of the Union in relation to noise at airports.
On the basis of the decision adopted at the thirty-third assembly of the ICAO in 2001, which establishes the framework for introducing restrictions, including those of night flights, the Commission presented a proposed Directive, which was adopted in March 2002.
By means of a preliminary analysis and consultation procedure, this Directive allows for the imposition of prohibitions of night flights in Community airports in which it is justified in accordance with objective criteria.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I wonder where you live when you stay in Brussels; probably not in the northern part of the city.
I imagine that you stay in a place where night flights are few and far between, for otherwise your response would be different.
Do you realise that if there is no general European ban on night flights, this will result in competition between airports and in competition with a downward effect, where the acceptance of noise will be exchanged for jobs?
Do you realise that in that way, you contribute towards an economy where the volume and pace of work increases constantly, to the detriment of the quality of life?
The standards of the World Health Organisation are crystal clear: night noise leads to more irritability and to depression.
Could I ask you, Commissioner, to review your intervention, and may I invite you to spend an evening, or a night, with me in the northern part of Brussels, so that you can see for yourself what those people have to put up with day and night?
Â Â  . â Mr Staes, I live in an area of Brussels which is very pleasant â as is the whole of Brussels â very lovely, close to a wonderful park, and I have a railway track passing by my house and therefore a series of trains pass each night.
So I would like to ask you, are we going to prohibit trains from passing because they make noise and wake me up?
In my case, since you are interested, I must say that I occasionally hear a train and on occasions they have woken me up, because I do not always sleep sufficiently deeply.
Mr Staes, I must also tell you that when I bought the house the railway track was already there.
Secondly, as I have said, we are aware of the problem of noise and international rules have been agreed within the International Civil Aviation Organisation to produce analyses and studies, to consider what solutions are available in order to reduce the acoustic impact in inhabited areas close to airports and to resolve them.
It is true that one of the possibilities is to suspend nocturnal flights.
That possibility exists and there are several airports in Europe which are doing so.
Thirdly, what you are asking, Mr Staes, is that, as well as suspending flights and in order to continue enjoying that tranquillity, airports should close.
But there are airports which do not have these problems, because nobody is living nearby, because they are more isolated, because they have different routes.
You are asking, for example, that they should close in the north of Finland in order not to create problems for workers in Brussels.
Mr Staes, I am not going to propose that.
Amongst other things because, if I did, it would be a comparative advantage.
And competition in Europe is based on a series of values and one of them is this.
And that is not unfair competition.
They are quite simply different situations.
And if Brussels has problems, it must adapt to these situations and, possibly, suspend night flights, but what you cannot ask is for the suspension of night flights in Athens because there are problems in Brussels.
Perhaps UPS flies to Athens.
If this is the case, what can I do about it?
I could give you several examples of comparative advantage of other types.
And that is how competition works.
I am sorry, Mr Staes, but it will not be me who presents that proposal.
Â Â  I must inform you that several Members have requested the floor.
The first two to request the floor were undoubtedly MrÂ Alavanos and Mr RÃŒbig.
Furthermore, the Rules of Procedure advise giving the floor to Members of a different political group and nationality to the questioner.
Â Â  â Commissioner, obviously you anticipated my question and referred to Athens airport.
I have listened to your opinion in general on night flights and I agree, and to your opinion on railway lines, which indeed cannot be moved.
When aeroplanes, however, in order to save a few minutes' flying time or a few litres of fuel, fly over residential areas, instead of turning in to land over the sea, which is exactly what happens at Athens International Airport, thereby disturbing residential areas with hundreds of thousands of residents, what happens then?
As far as I know, the European Commission should already have received a complaint on this subject about Athens International Airport and I should like to ask you what happens in this case.
Â Â  . â Mr Alavanos, what you have just said is absolutely right.
That is another story, however.
It is a question of seeking routes which reduce impact and, where necessary, to impose obligations on air companies in order to reduce the impact.
If necessary, this must go as far as prohibiting flights; I am not saying that flights must not be prohibited.
And I do not know whether it will be necessary to prohibit nocturnal flights in Athens as well.
Population, possible solutions, sound levels, and other issues indicate whether or not nocturnal flights have to be prohibited, but not the fact that they have to be prohibited in Brussels.
In other words, we cannot prohibit them in Athens because they have to be prohibited in Brussels.
That is what the Commission is not prepared to support.
What you have said is absolutely right, however.
Routes and flight paths are extremely important, as well as ways of taking off and, as you say quite rightly, it is true that sometimes, when trying to save fuel, much more noise is produced than is necessary in normal conditions.
This management is the responsibility of the airports.
Â Â  â Commissioner, let me start by saying that I sleep particularly well in Brussels â I am not sure why that is.
I want to speak, though, as a member of the delegation for relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and we have a problem with night flight restrictions and ZÃŒrich airport.
What is your view on the way in which flights between southern Germany and ZÃŒrich have developed, and how will the legal situation evolve in years to come?
The fact is there are numerous complaints, meaning on the one hand that aeroplanes are not supposed to approach over ZÃŒrich, while the Germans do not want them either.
As a result, at the moment there is a ban on approach routes over southern Germany, which in turn has led to an increased number of flight approaches over the city of ZÃŒrich.
I would therefore be interested to hear how the European Union, and in particular the Commission, expects this problem to develop in future.
Â Â  . â Last week we replied to this request, which had been made by the German Government, to implement certain types of restriction.
They are restrictions on nocturnal flights to Zurich and, quite simply, in accordance with the existing agreements between Switzerland and the European Union in the field of transport and air transport, specifically, and in accordance with the rules of the ICAO and others, they are correct and compatible.
That was our reply a few days ago.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commission has received broad support for the proposals in the Green Paper âTowards a European strategy for the security of energy supplyâ, in relation to maintaining access to Community reserves of soft coal and maintaining a basic level of production to this effect.
In accordance with this idea, the Commission has proposed and the Council has approved â with the prior opinion of the European Parliament â Council Regulation (EC) No 1407/2002 of 23 July 2002, on state aid to the coal industry.
The objectives included in this regulation differ from those mentioned by the honourable Member in relation to the company .
Coal companies which receive state aid have always been obliged to pursue economic viability.
Furthermore, an important innovation in the new Council Regulation is that the contribution of autochthonous coal to the objective of energy security must be carried out within the framework of sustainable development.
The Commission therefore believes that both opencast and subterranean mines can respect the principles of sustainable development in so far as they comply with Community legislation.
Â Â  Mrs de Palacio, for months now I have sometimes had difficulty following your arguments, and that is still the case as regards your reply on the subject of coal.
You say that we should continue opencast mining in Europe because there is a supply problem.
There are no shortages on the world coal market.
There has been no fluctuation in prices for decades, and there has never been any pressure on Europe, which has no difficulty in obtaining coal.
This shows that you do not have any objective criteria.
The âpercentage of importsâ criterion cannot be regarded as a threat to our security of supply.
We are much more seriously threatened by, for example, computer viruses.
To come back to this particular Spanish case, we have the impression that in the region concerned, MrÂ Victorino Alonso, who is the boss of the various undertakings, is misusing the money that Europe gives him, because he is using the money to improve the competitiveness of his undertakings, whereas it is money that ought to be used to preserve jobs in the region.
Â Â  Mr Turmes, I would ask you to put supplementary questions.
I have already said this today.
The Rules of Procedure provide for other opportunities for statements and debates.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Turmes is talking about something different, otherwise I do not understand.
The aid for coal is not European aid, because Europe gives nothing to , but it is aid from the Spanish national government, not from Europe.
The Commission and the European Union, at Community level, do not fund aid to the coal sector.
Mr Turmes must be talking about national aid received by that company within the framework of the restructuring plan for coal presented by Spain.
I would also say to Mr Turmes that the Commission has no record of the things you are talking about.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the lines mentioned in the oral question are part of the priority project no 8, multimodal axis Portugal-Spain-rest of Europe, included in the Commissionâs Decision of 1996 on the Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network.
The growth initiative has also considered that the cross-border Vigo-Oporto line fulfilled the conditions for being included on the so-called âquick start listâ for which, as the honourable Members are aware, as well as being part of the trans-European networks, it must have a cross-border component and work on it must begin immediately, that is to say, in the next three years (2004-2006).
During the period 2000-2006 the Cohesion Fund is financing the MiÃ±o line, to the north of Oporto.
The decisions relating to the granting of total aid of EUR 87Â million for the Nine-Braga-Lousada-Nine lines will be adopted in the coming days.
Since 1987, studies on the Galician Atlantic Ferrol-Portuguese border railway line have received Community aid, which in 2003 amounted to a total of almost EUR 6 million.
For the period 2004-2006 it is intended to allocate another EUR 5 million to fund studies on this rail axis, in response to a new request from the Spanish authorities.
With regard to the Spanish railway line between Ferrol and the Portuguese border, several technical studies have been completed and many are still in the process of being produced.
Work has already begun to the north of Vigo.
According to the information received from the national authorities â Portuguese and Spanish â the Vigo-La CoruÃ±a line is expected to enter into service in 2007 and the Vigo-Oporto link in 2009, and the La CoruÃ±a-Ferrol line, which would complete the section of the line in Spanish territory, would be ready and operational from 2010.
Â Â  . â The Commission understands that the honourable Member is referring to an issue which is before the Court of Justice relating, amongst other things, to the conditions applicable to the crew laid down in Greek legislation for ships which carry out cabotage services.
In the request relating to this issue the Commission made no distinction between the rules applicable to deck crew and those applicable to engine-room crew.
The rules on crews are applicable to the crew of the ship as a whole.
What the Commission reproaches the Greek state for in relation to this issue is the application of the rules of the host state for cruise ships for which Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 lays down the application of the rules of the flag State.
The application of the rules on the crew of the host state for island cabotage is intended solely for regular services.
Furthermore, in this case as well, the applicable national rules may not contravene the principle of free provision of services.
Therefore, any requirement imposed by national legislation with regard to the crew may not introduce restrictions which are not justified by urgent reasons of general interest and the restrictions must be proportionate to the intended objective.
Within this context, the Commission would point out that the SOLAS and STCW Conventions â ratified by all the States of the Union â contain rules with regard to crews of ships, the objective of which is precisely safety at sea.
As it pointed out in its recent communication on the interpretation of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92, the Commission believes that, with regard to the rules in the field of safety and training, any condition which goes further than the rules contained in those Conventions would constitute a disproportionate restriction of the free provision of services.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think that there is a contradiction in the Commission's positions and I shall ask a question so that the Commissioner can resolve my doubt: apart from the question of cruise ships, I should like to ask the Commissioner, in relation to other passenger ships, if she believes that the host state can regulate the manning of cabotage vessels not just for the deck and engine crew, but also for the cabin crew and catering personnel.
In other words, are the rights of the host state the same when it comes to the deck and engine crew and the cabin crew and catering personnel?
Â Â  . â Mr President, this issue is before the Court, and the situation is that, on 1 January, the special transitional period which Greece has enjoyed will also come to an end, in application of the Directive in force, and, therefore, it will not be possible to discriminate in any way.
Furthermore, Mr Alavanos, we are talking about the crew as a whole.
In any event, the Court will inform us of all the elements and will put an end to our doubts, if we have any.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your cooperation with Parliament this evening, Mrs de Palacio.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 37 to 72 will be replied to in writing.(3)
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0457/2003) from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market and amending Directive 92/42/EEC (10345/2/2003 â C5-0444/2003 â 2002/0185(COD)) (Rapporteur: Norbert Glante).
Â Â  â Commissioner, a very good evening to you.
I was in my seat in good time for the start.
This eveningâs debate, which we are holding in the cosy circle of insiders, revolves around a technology â cogeneration â which is a recognised environmental tool.
Cogeneration can be used in many different ways, from district heating, mainly in northern Europe, to production plants, as in the ceramics and paper industries in other countries.
Cogeneration, involves the simultaneous production of electricity and heat in what is usually an energy-saving process.
This directive focuses primarily on high-efficiency cogeneration, namely processes which offer energy savings of at least 10%.
This is one of the main reasons why cogeneration is used as a means of increasing energy efficiency and why it contributes to greater security of supply.
Last monthâs blackouts have demonstrated that we need to do something to improve security of supply.
I would like to start by commenting on the way the Council deals with Parliament.
This directive has been under discussion since September 2002 â nearly 18 months.
The first reading in Parliament was very controversial.
The second reading was much more consensus-oriented.
Unfortunately, the Council common position accepted very few of the amendments proposed by this House.
During the second reading, the Council again showed little flexibility and openness to our demands.
As I see it, the Council adopted a âno can doâ position from the outset and we were repeatedly told that there was no scope for going beyond the common position.
In my view, there were times when the way in which the negotiations were conducted was closer to a consultation procedure than to codecision.
The compromise solutions were eventually adopted not because I as rapporteur was completely happy with the result, but rather because the Council put pressure on Parliament â there being no longer enough time for a conciliation procedure if the Council was to keep to schedule.
More pressure was applied through the statements made by a number of delegations in the Council questioning the need for a directive promoting cogeneration, and making it clear that the directive would be blocked if Parliament requested anything beyond this support.
Let me now tell you what I think merits praise in this directive.
The aim of the directive is to promote cogeneration technologies, which can help to improve energy efficiency and security of supply.
Cogeneration is now on the European Unionâs energy policy agenda.
The directive means the Union now has a policy on cogeneration.
Europe has a harmonised definition of cogeneration, meaning that there is now a common understanding of what cogeneration is.
Classification as high-efficiency cogeneration is determined using a two-stage process as defined in Annexes II and III of the directive.
Firstly, cogenerated electricity is calculated using the Prothermo method as described in Annex II.
Based on this method and taking into account the results from a CEN/CENELEC workshop currently in progress, the Commission is to devise a standard calculation for cogenerated electricity and the necessary guidelines for using it.
Secondly, in order to qualify as high efficiency cogeneration, the process must provide energy savings of at least 10%, as laid down in Annex III.
The Commission will provide harmonised reference values for calculating the energy savings.
This was an important step forward and an important demand on Parliamentâs part.
The order in which Annexes II and III are applied has not been harmonised.
The alternative calculation methods will therefore remain valid, and these will, if necessary, be harmonised in a new draft Commission directive.
A standard procedure for issuing certificates of origin has already been provided, which is important for cross-border trade and therefore for the single market.
The Member States are required to compile statistical data about national generation of electricity and heat using cogeneration.
The Member States also have to assess the potential for using cogeneration and inform the Commission of their conclusions.
The Commission is required to evaluate these reports and, if necessary, submit an action plan for developing cogeneration in the EU.
National instruments and financial support should focus on primary energy savings.
Legal and other barriers are to be removed.
The directive establishes a definition of and a special status for micro-cogeneration.
Under this directive, micro-cogeneration refers to installations with a maximum capacity of 50kWe.
Micro-cogeneration operators may use certified values for calculation purposes, thus reducing their administrative burden.
Member States can facilitate access to the grid for small installations and micro-cogeneration operators.
Obviously we would have liked to see more on this subject.
So what does not appear in the directive that we would have liked to see included?
There are no targets set for the EU or individual Member States, no special assistance, and insufficient support for micro-cogeneration installations, which unfortunately means there is no assistance for increasing market penetration over the next few years.
There are no practical measures aimed at increasing cogeneration as a proportion of total electricity generation in Europe, and grid access for cogenerated electricity is not adequately regulated in terms of support measures.
At the moment, existing calculation methods have not been harmonised â in fact, alternative methods are valid until 2010.
Cogeneration powered by nuclear energy has not been excluded from the scope of the directive.
The European Parliament would undoubtedly have wished for a more ambitious directive.
But at least this directive establishes a common understanding of cogeneration and lays a foundation for the promotion of cogeneration in Europe.
The course has been set for harmonising calculation methods for cogenerated electricity and primary energy savings.
The Member States are going to have to consider the technology, because they have to evaluate the national generation capacities and potential then report to the Commission.
The Commission is required to present an action plan for developing cogeneration if there is no increase in cogeneration usage.
This places cogeneration policy on the agenda at EU level, which represents a great success for the European Union.
Let me close by challenging the Member States to report on the national potential for extending cogeneration as soon as possible, to make use of that potential, and to remove any and all barriers to increasing the share of cogeneration.
I also say to the Commission that we need a new directive on European support schemes and total harmonisation of the energy market as soon as possible.
As I conclude, let me thank my co-rapporteurs, the shadow rapporteurs, all those colleagues who have contributed, and also the Commission.
I think we worked well together.
In our discussions I repeatedly emphasised my understanding of a compromise as a solution that is slightly painful to all sides.
I hope everyone has suffered to the same degree, and I hope that when we adopt the compromise amendments tomorrow we will have a reasonable directive.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to say it is a great satisfaction to me to think that we are on the point of completing the process of adopting the Directive on the promotion of cogeneration.
In this regard, I would like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Glante, and also the other shadow rapporteurs and the other MEPs responsible, who have worked intensively on this Directive which is so important to Europe's energy policy and, at the same time, so technically complex in many cases.
The directive on the promotion of cogeneration is a step forward, which is intended to help to resolve the problems faced by our energy sector in Europe, such as the need to save energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
High efficiency cogeneration means greater efficiency, since it implies energy savings and therefore reductions in emissions.
We are also considering cogeneration with renewable energy sources, at a time when this helps us to increase the security of supply and to reduce the vulnerability relating to the transport of electricity, sometimes across long distances; in fact, cogeneration normally means greater proximity between the production of electricity and the demand for it and therefore brings generation closer to consumption.
It also means greater flexibility in the energy supply, since, I would insist, cogeneration can be carried out on the basis of any fuel, including renewable energy sources.
The European industry has been demanding a regulation of this type for a long time; it follows our work very closely and I believe that everybody considers what we can achieve tonight and tomorrow, in the vote, to be a good agreement â earlier Mr Glante said that âit does a little harm to everyoneâ, perhaps that is partly why it is a good agreement.
There is an extremely important point, which Mr Glante has pointed out, which is that in cogeneration they are different concepts, which are hidden depending on the different countries.
Thanks to this discussion we are converging these different concepts, leading us to something which appears essential: that cogeneration is genuine cogeneration and means an improvement in the true global energy balance.
The establishment of objectives in relation to the promotion of cogeneration has been one of the fundamental issues in the debate between the Council and Parliament, and I believe that ensuring that the Member States are prepared to determine and notify their potentials is a very important step forward, and is the correct one.
These reports will have to be published and subjected to examination by all the parties involved, and I have no doubt that the viable potentials will be followed by the measures necessary to implement and utilise the potential of cogeneration for energy efficiency.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliamentâs amendments have clearly improved not just the initial Directive, which we had presented to Parliament and the Council, but also the common position and, in particular, on this point which the rapporteur referred to, microgeneration, a new and promising technology.
I am delighted by Parliamentâs initiatives to insist on this issue and to provide the modifications which allow it to be included directly into our Directive.
Parliament has also contributed to other improvements to the common position, such as the authorisation of the committee responsible for the complex technical details and adapting the thresholds of technical development, and I would like to thank them once again for the work they have done, which has demonstrated once again the seriousness and skill of this Parliament, even when we are dealing with and discussing enormously technical issues, as in this case.
I congratulate you on the wonderfully high quality of your work.
I would like once again to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Glante, all the shadow rapporteurs and the other participants in these debates for their contributions.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by thanking you for your kind words acknowledging Parliamentâs efforts.
We know that it is not only engineers who sit in Parliament but also good, elected politicians who seek to make the best of each proposal.
In particular, I would like to thank Mr Glante and also Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, who have been very involved in this discussion.
I think we have learnt a great deal over the past few months about the technology involved, and eventually concluded that, at the end of the day, this is still a political decision.
I would also like to express my thanks for the compromise solution, which received substantial support from our colleagues.
I think our colleaguesâ work represents an even greater achievement given the complexity of the subject matter they had to get to grips with.
The way the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has voted indicates that this directive will be approved tomorrow.
I think it is a good thing that we have avoided a conciliation procedure.
Perhaps we could have included a few more items that way, but I consider that the main points of our general approach are already present.
We wanted to play it safe and make sure we had a directive since, particularly next year, when the internal market comes out of the budgets, the directive will clearly be very important for establishing a level playing field for all market players from the outset.
That is also why the relevant definitions were very important.
Our aim is to improve the security of our energy supply.
Obviously we can make use of micro-cogeneration, for a start.
We want to see lots of market players, who will improve the security of energy supply but will also increase energy efficiency and above all â I think this was the really decisive factor â will improve grid security.
The blackouts have taught us all that there is often a great difference between the electricity traded and that which is actually supplied, and consequently that we need a lot of points in the grid to provide grid stability.
Residential users then have an opportunity later on to recover part of their energy bill as electricity supply.
Micro-cogeneration provides an opportunity for householders to obtain more efficient and cheaper energy along with greater energy security from the energy industry as domestic users.
This benefits both the public sector and domestic consumers, and we are here to work for the good of our citizens.
I believe that lower energy bills will result in a healthier bank balance for every citizen.
A standard definition of cogeneration is essential.
I think that the most important point is actually our declaration that we will accept different calculation methods, notably the CEN proposal, which we await with great interest.
We have Prothermo as a basis, but the Commission should also carefully examine our proposals for calculating net electricity.
This sets a standard that will, in future, be very important for everyone.
Another particularly important element is the equal weighting given to producersâ own consumption of cogenerated electricity and electricity fed into the grid, and therefore to mechanical and other plants which do not feed into the grid.
Energy is very important in this support system.
I think we have achieved the best possible result.
No one got everything, but I think this optimum solution will also allow us to show how important Europe is, including in our elections next year.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Glante, for what was a considerable task.
Increased CHP is one of the best means to improve the efficiency of the energy economy and reduce greenhouse gases that result from this sort of generation.
Let us combat emissions with science, efficiency and moderation.
We in Finland have a lot of good things to say about cogeneration.
We are pioneers in this field.
Cogeneration now accounts for a third of the electricity produced in Finland.
I support the directive, as it will provide an impetus for increased generation of this type throughout Europe.
The Union really must set an example in this area.
It is to be hoped that initiatives of this kind will also be adopted by our new neighbours as speedily as possible, so that production might also be increased in this way in the Unionâs neighbouring regions.
In our national strategy this path has almost reached its end and district heating plants and industrial sites have on the whole already exploited cogeneration.
Our energy economy is very diverse, versatile and efficient.
The price of electricity should be lowered, and on that point I agree with the previous speaker.
We realise that it is important that it should remain within the powers of decision of the Member States as to what means are used to increase common targets.
We are out of step with one another within the Union in this regard.
I would like to mention one detail.
I am in favour of the Councilâs support for the amendment in the report which states that it would be the Commissionâs task to assess the effects of a harmonised calculation method and propose further action to promote harmonisation.
I support this approach because it must be the long-term aim to harmonise definitions employed in national objectives.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I too want to thank MrÂ Glante, on behalf of my party, for producing a very creditable report.
He has done a lot of work to promote this idea, listened to the various parties and achieved a good end result.
I heartily support cogeneration, which is an environmental and energy policy instrument for increasing energy efficiency and improving the security of energy supplies.
As MrÂ Paasilinna just said, we in Finland have good things to say about cogeneration.
Producing a directive to apply to the Union as a whole is a difficult process, because the directive is a technically demanding one and circumstances and practices vary greatly between the Member States.
Our group supports the compromises drafted by the rapporteur and hopes the directive will now speedily move forward.
In my opinion it is important that this issue should be taken forward, albeit one step at a time.
The EU is very dependent on imports of energy.
This creates uncertainty, and rising import ratios increase the risk of supplies being interrupted.
It is essential to increase the share of cogeneration.
This directive can create a framework for increased cogeneration.
The Member States must jointly approve the defined criteria whereby binding targets may be achieved.
Experience has shown that if targets are not binding on Member States, progress is slow.
The potential for cogeneration can be optimised when the various operators are aware of the opportunities that are available to exploit the technology and find compatible systems.
Accordingly, it is particularly important that there is cooperation between different operators and that they can exchange information on good practices.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we have added another floor to the building of the Unionâs energy policy which the Commission â and in particular Vice-President de Palacio â have been promoting since the beginning of this legislative period.
The well-known cornerstones of this energy policy are security of supply, reducing our energy bill and the preservation of the environment.
Cogeneration is a very valuable instrument in terms of fulfilling these objectives and therefore this directive was timely and necessary.
We have seen clearly during this discussion and the production of this important legislative initiative that sometimes two interests, two sectors, are in clear conflict.
In this case, the two interests to be harmonised were that of those who produce heat and that of those who use heat in an industrial process. These two interests in conflict were represented curiously by two physical parameters: the energy efficiency of the installation and the saving of primary energy.
What we have done through our work together has been to try to ultimately achieve a balanced approach which establishes the foundations for the promotion of cogeneration, dealing objectively with all the interests involved in this significant activity.
I believe, Mr President, that we have achieved this thanks to the excellent work of the rapporteur, MrÂ Glante, and of the various Members who have contributed to this objective and ultimately we have demonstrated that consensus does not always spoil things, but there are occasions when consensus, in the end, achieves a result which today we can all celebrate.
I would therefore like to end, Mr President, by expressing my satisfaction with this achievement.
We have undoubtedly taken a step forward in relation to this energy policy which we all share and let us hope that this directive will soon result in a harmonised method and a unified model for promoting cogeneration which allows us to achieve the objectives which we have all been pursuing for some time.
Â Â  â Mr President, to complete the picture, let me say that the Council sent a letter to the Secretariat and to me, so the formalities have been observed.
The Council has acknowledged our compromise.
I had an opportunity to speak yesterday about the report by Mr Chichester.
At that time we had not received any letter.
So we have made some progress.
I now want to make sure that it is clear to those concerned what CHP really means.
It means Christmas Holiday Package.
I think we all deserve a pat on the back, and I wish you a merry Christmas.
Â Â  â Mr President, this issue has been debated in many forums and I thank the rapporteur for his considerable input with regard to this matter, which is essentially connected with the workings of the internal market and cogeneration and which will hopefully now be brought to a conclusion.
With the latest compromise proposals the directive has indeed progressed in the right direction.
It is good that no national targets are being set: the approach is positive and encouraging.
CHP should be promoted, as it is an efficient and natural way to produce electricity and heat.
It is also important that financial support for CHP should not be restricted to electric power plants generating less than 50 megawatts.
We should oppose the financial support proposed for small-scale CHP, for example by providing them with a free connection to the grid and guaranteeing prices.
This would distort competition in the open electricity market which we are trying right now to create within the EU.
Small-scale CHP should be supported in other ways, optionally, without distorting competition, and where CHP is a cost-effective technology.
Biomass should become a more frequent option as a fuel in cogeneration.
It would be a way of furthering the realisation of targets related to the use of renewables and reducing emissions.
Talks on emissions trading might result in the special financial support for cogeneration proving to be superfluous.
It is expected that emissions trading will in any case lead to a rise in energy prices, putting a strain on users in the market as a result.
It is important to promote cogeneration, as it is a good solution both economically and environmentally.
The agreed compromise proposals now constitute a step forward with regard to this issue.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for your speeches.
I would like to point out that, as Alejo Vidal-Quadras has quite rightly pointed out, through this definition we have managed to combine and include within the concept of cogeneration the two types of cogeneration which furthermore are usually divided in accordance with European geography; that which pursues energy efficiency in an industrial process and that which pursues it in the field of the production of heat essentially associated with the task of heating in communities.
In the end, we have produced this global definition, we have a positive energy balance, which means that, by means of cogeneration, these results are achieved with less consumption of energy than would be required by the production of these two activities separately.
That is what we are aiming for: greater overall energy efficiency.
On this occasion consensus â as the honourable Member said a moment ago â brings positive results.
I believe that achieving a good consensus means combining, overcoming, rather than watering down or weakening, and, as in this case, we are building and strengthening the support for this series of measures which, together, throughout this time have made up a European energy policy.

There still remains as a possible outstanding issue, the nuclear security package, on which I hope Parliament will soon give its opinion; then we will have the package presented the other day by the Council, the new energy package, which will be the third package following the gas and electricity packages, in order to guarantee greater security in this supply in a liberalised market and in order to deal with the reality of enlargement.
This is the final plenary session of this year, the final new year of this legislature.
There will be another legislature and I hope that all of you will be sitting here â if you wish to be â but I believe it is important to assess what we have done.
We have moved on from statements on energy efficiency, cogeneration, the use of renewable energy sources â which were often wonderful and full of goodwill, but mere statements nonetheless â to taking measures with specific objectives in order to promote energy efficiency, cogeneration and the use of renewable energy sources in different areas and in different applications.
We have also worked in other areas, such as security of supply and effective operation of the market, issues which raise problems in relation to this vital element of energy, not to mention issues such as security in the nuclear field, which I referred to a moment ago.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the honourable Members for their work and cooperation throughout all this time, in particular, on this directive, which is complex, but which I believe will have very positive effects, and I wish you a happy Christmas and all the best for 2004.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, and Christmas greetings to you.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0431/2003) by JÃŒrgen Zimmerling, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council extending and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1659/98 on decentralised cooperation (COM(2003) 413 â C5-0319/2003 â 2003/0156(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zimmerling, for his work on this regulation and especially for the efforts he made to conclude the legislative process at first reading.
The objective of our proposal is primarily to extend the legal basis for the decentralised cooperation budget line for an additional period of three years.
This will ensure the continuity of the budget line until the end of 2006 when the new financial perspectives will be established.
It will also give time for a more thorough discussion with all concerned partners on the role of the budget line and its financial allocation.
The outcome of this discussion should provide the basis for a revision of the strategic guidelines for the decentralised cooperation instrument in a longer-term perspective.
The latest evaluation of the implementation of this budget line which was sent to Parliament in July insisted on the strong added value of the concept of decentralised cooperation as a complementary tool for the actions implemented under the national indicative programmes in favour of the local civil society.
The proposed amendments by the Committee on Development are mainly intended to clarify the eligibility of some decentralised cooperation agents to ensure better coherence with the comitology used and to guarantee better reporting on the implementation of actions financed under this budget line.
The Commission is happy to agree with all these amendments.
They reflect well the fruitful discussions between the rapporteur, the Council working group and the Commission services.
The sole exception would be Amendment No 5 concerning the increase of the financial allocation from EUR 18 million to 36 million.
I understand Parliament's concerns that greater emphasis should be given to strengthening the role of local actors, and in particular southern civil society, in development cooperation.
We are making a considerable effort in this direction.
However, as I explained in the letter I sent to Parliament two weeks ago, it is not necessary to seek additional funds specifically for decentralised cooperation on this budget line, as it is clear from our proposal that the financing proposed is to be used primarily in situations of difficult partnership.
In other areas the geographical instruments may be used.
I need to confirm here that the Commission, fully supported on this by the Council, cannot accept the proposed increase in the budget.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are considering a regulation which expires at the end of the year.
The role of this report is to provide a successor.
We want to continue with the existing and worthwhile provisions in 2004-06, and in order for the legal basis to allow a seamless transition we want to try to succeed on the first reading, together with the Council and the Commission.
We seem to have been successful so far, in that all the amendments proposed today are, on the whole, very worthy of support.
We have sought to put the emphasis on the initiatives and stakeholders in the decentralised cooperation in the developing countries themselves rather than those in the European Union.
The wording of Amendment No 10 is now the result of a compromise proposed by Mr Sauquillo PÃ©rez del Arco and myself, and now states, among other things, that independent establishments are also included.
We have adopted the wording used in Recital 11 on the status of churches and ideological groups in the Annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam to ensure that the ministers could accept it without any difficulties.
The Commissioner has already said that Amendment No 5 is the real sticking point.
Everything else has also been agreed in the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
Amendment No 5 provides for an increase from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million.
I have to say that while obviously I would like to see such an increase, given the current situation I do not think this report and the new regulation are the appropriate place for demanding one.
It would undoubtedly mean â as the Council has made very clear â that no solution would be agreed at first reading.
For that reason, I would prefer to stick with the EUR 18 million, as per the proposal, and then set a higher figure in the new negotiations for 2007 onwards.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Zimmerling, on his work, which has allowed us to reach a consensus on a good regulation on decentralised cooperation, which is necessary to the process of modernising Community development policy.
And this consensus has been reached not just in Parliament, but at interinstitutional level, which means that, as soon as possible and for the next three years, we will have a renewed legal basis for implementing this policy.
Decentralised cooperation, that is to say, the participation of non-state actors and sub-state bodies â both of the European countries and of the receiving countries â is a necessary condition for a participative development which responds to the needs and initiatives of the population to which cooperation is ultimately directed.
It is an added factor in the democratisation of developing societies, since by means of decentralised cooperation the social fabric is strengthened, and it is also a proven element in the effectiveness of aid and a factor in making the concept of appropriation of development processes a reality.
Development cooperation ceased some time ago to be solely bilateral or multilateral and governmental or non-governmental.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists therefore enthusiastically supports increasingly improved decentralised cooperation.
Let us accept therefore that â from the point of view of sustainable and participative local development â neither those people in Europe who believe that this approach may be used to encourage movements outside of the States nor the authorities of the receiving countries who are afraid of losing control over the aid which they consider to be their own are right.
Decentralised cooperation looks more towards the actors than towards economic resources or the sectoral contents of cooperation.
With regard to economic resources â mentioned by the rapporteur â we have given up our initial desire for greater allocation of funds for the sake of the interinstitutional agreement, but we have a commitment from the Commission to maintain adequate execution of the programme and we believe, however, that the decentralised cooperation line must continue to increase and not be a minor budget line from which funds can be taken in order to fill other gaps.
At the moment we have EUR 9 million for the first year and EUR 6 million for the two following years in line B7-6002, without prejudice to the fact that resources from geographical lines can benefit decentralised cooperation actions.
We do not believe this to be satisfactory â we would like to have more â but, for the sake of consensus, we can reach this agreement.
Since we are talking about a transversal line, it has no sectoral limits and we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have tried to open it up to the greatest possible number of beneficiaries, so that social organisation is effectively promoted.
It is made explicit that local public powers are also considered municipal authorities and we are happy with the extension of the Regulation and the modifications which have been introduced, bearing in mind the references to the Gemelli, Carrilho and Howitt reports and we hope that the Commission will henceforth comply with the time periods for assessment and presentation of results established by Parliament so that we can analyse the effectiveness of this instrument in terms of development.
Â Â  Mr President, for the Greens, decentralised cooperation is an essential element of cooperation and development policy.
In fact, it is one of the only constituents of that policy which guarantees the real use of funds by the nations of the South.
Mr Zimmerlingâs report is a step in the right direction, in that he has created a real instrument which guarantees the participation of citizens in developing countries.
The Howitt report had already opened up some interesting lines of action, and this new report improves even further the collaboration with non-governmental organisations.
We welcome the development of the list of potential partners.
It is particularly important to us that account should be taken of the organisations of the indigenous populations.
They are in many cases minorities and suffer opposition from the public authorities, which more often than not represent authoritarian powers.
As far as those who are actually involved are concerned, however, the question of the churches gives rise to problems.
Although it seems obvious to everyone that charitable organisations, including those of a religious nature, can benefit from funds for decentralised cooperation, on the other hand it seems inconceivable to me that the European Union should, under this heading, be funding the churches themselves, since by definition their aim is proselytisation.
Are we going to finance Catholic churches or Protestant chapels in Moslem countries, or the building of mosques in Christian countries?
We discussed this with the rapporteur, who seemed to have understood the problem that was raised.
The fact that this viewpoint was retained before the vote in committee may have looked like an oversight.
Now, however, when the Committee on Development and Cooperation has rejected this word, and by a large majority, its re-insertion through the intervention of the Council Presidency, which has used a version of the Treaty of Amsterdam â minus its philosophical elements â leaves me somewhat puzzled as to the final objective of this text.
In the absence of any clarification on this point, we shall not be able to vote in favour of this report.
I would therefore strongly urge my fellow Members to return to the amendment adopted at the committee stage, whereby the list was restricted to charitable organisations.
It is vital that as many representatives of civil society as possible can make their opinions known, and can have recourse to funding which is independent of their state authorities, so as to strengthen the independence of social movements which are campaigning for sustainable development, for human rights and for social rights, for democratisation or for cultural pluralism.
This is why we are asking that the overall funding should be increased from EUR 18 million to EUR 36 million.
This appears to us to be vitally important if all those involved are to take part in the debate.
In other words, it is not enough to create a good policy: it is even more important to provide it with adequate financial resources.
Â Â  â Mr President, the best way of providing development aid is by doing justice to the local context in developing countries.
It stands to reason that there needs to be consultation with local parties.
The instrument of decentralised cooperation, however, has raised a few questions.
First of all, the separate budget line; a line for decentralised cooperation is an experiment of recent years.
The assessment that the Commission has commissioned shows no trace of effective implementation.
It is therefore unreasonable to persist with a separate budget line.
Unfortunately, I cannot find this consideration in the report.
The selection of projects, in particular, is problematic.
A transparent framework is required within which the delegations select the right projects.
The criteria for this selection should be sound and their application insightful.
According to the assessment report, however, the selection process is not transparent at all.
Moreover, follow-up and assessment are inadequate; in fact, according to the assessment report, they are absent.
Whilst the Commissionâs delegations appreciate the instrumentâs flexibility, the lack of transparency and assessment cause me to conclude that its flexibility is excessive.
Finally, the Commission has proposed an increase in the budget; the Zimmerling report goes further and proposes a huge increase, but neither the Commission document nor the report adduce convincing arguments for this increase.
In short, there is no reason for great faith in the correctness of the approach adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, decentralised cooperation should be seen as one element of sustainable development, which values the role of local operators, provides incentives for consolidating civil society and promotes partners, not only .
We must give our full support to the Commission proposal examined in the report.
I must emphasise, however, that the issue of decentralised cooperation should be addressed more consistently.
For example, this proposal should have been presented some time ago.
I must point out that, at the time of the first extension, when I was asked to draw up a report, the presentation was already extremely late.
Issues relating to the financial framework must be emphasised: predicting an increase undoubtedly sends out a positive message, perhaps the only one possible, but is still far from adequate, mainly because we cannot confine ourselves to making funds available.
We must also make a more serious effort to increase understanding of this type of aid, so that it is not always the same people who benefit from it, such as those who, as a result of having better connections, are better positioned to have the necessary information and explanations.
Whether or not more candidates are put forward depends largely on us, on the way in which we disseminate information, on our making the application processes less bureaucratic.
The Commission delegations could give some support at the stage of submitting applications.
I wish, lastly, to congratulate MrÂ Zimmerling on the work he has undertaken and to support the amendments that have been tabled, in particular those concerned with extending the range of potential beneficiaries â and here I would underline all those that I mentioned â and with strengthening networks operating in the field of human rights and democratisation processes.
Â Â  . â Mr President, may I begin by expressing my appreciation of the political signals that have been expressed in these different contributions.
I agree with everybody who has said that this is an important and interesting area of activity.
I also appreciate the realistic and constructive reaction to the need to keep to the budget level, which is necessary to move it forward.
I would make one additional remark, namely, that when we look at volume and this activity, the big show is the funding of non-State actors in ACP countries starting up now.
In general, the average money available is between 5 and 10% of the country envelope, when we look at the whole group of ACP countries.
This is for funding local NGOs, non-State actors and civil society in a broad sense.
The idea is that the decision-making here will mainly be in the hands of our head of delegation there.
That is truly decentralised cooperation.
What we have here is a budget line managed out of Brussels which we decentralised cooperation â a somewhat bureaucratic approach reflecting a time when we did not have the Cotonou agreement's new dimension of directly funding partners in civil society in those 78 countries.
That is not to say that this budget line and this instrument are becoming irrelevant, because they cover the whole geography, not only the ACP countries.
However, it underscores that the actual activity as such is something which has more to it than what we are discussing here.
So I see this budget line and the regulation and handling of it by Parliament as a way of clarifying the intentions.
However, there is â like the iceberg â something bigger below the surface of this budget line, and it is important to keep that in mind.
Let me again thank you for a constructive reaction by Parliament.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m tomorrow.
Â Â  ,. â Decentralised cooperation is a form of intervention that complements the EUâs development policy.
Its main aim is to improve the quality of aid and to create conditions for the undertaking of further action and cooperation.
Its main characteristic should not therefore be the amount of funding.
The development, moreover, of the legislative framework does not appear to have resulted so far in a greater take-up of appropriations, while the financial reference amount in the European Commission's proposal for 2004-2006 makes provision for an average annual sum which is higher than that of the previous period of application of the action and which, in my opinion, corresponds to the objective set.
I agree with the objectives and the need to continue the action.
In addition, the size of the aid and its experimental character impose a flexible procedure in order to optimise its efficiency.
However, it is understandable that action by these agencies and the management of Community funds on their part should be characterised by transparency and honest financial management.
Finally, I should like to point out the dynamic character of this form of cooperation.
It is important for the annual evaluation of the action not to be limited to a quantitative presentation of the actions funded, but also to include a qualitative evaluation of the cooperation so as to reveal the trends taking shape for coming years.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0447/2003) by Olga Zrihen, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on promoting gender equality in development cooperation (COM(2003) 465 â C5-0367/2003 â 2003/0176(COD)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Zrihen, for the excellent cooperation and for all her efforts to secure adoption at first reading.
I sincerely hope this is still a reality.
Our proposal for a regulation on promoting gender equality in development cooperation is very important in providing a clear political goal and in emphasising that the achievement of gender equality is crucial for development in general.
Since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, global improvement has been made in terms of promoting gender equality in developing countries.
In particular, progress has been made in putting in place a comprehensive gender mainstreaming strategy within the general framework of EU development cooperation.
However, even if the process is on track in setting the priorities, much remains to be done in terms of delivering results, such as improving the conditions of women in developing countries within a definite time perspective.
Therefore a more comprehensive strategic approach is needed to support the present implementation strategy.
In particular this regulation gives a stronger orientation that will make the process clearer and more visible and will make it easier to activate the necessary change to promote gender equality in development cooperation, building up a strong link to the achievement of the UN millennium development goals.
We all know that promoting gender equality is a long-term process.
Certainly it has taken a long time to get where we are, so that is the sad proof of the reality that this is long-term.
It is therefore vital that the catalytic and strategic role played by the present regulation is reinforced.
In fact there is a need for this regulation to fund innovative actions which are cost-effective and have the potential to be replicated in other areas or scaled up using other funding sources.
This is the real key to understanding the purpose of this regulation.
Parliament originally proposed to raise the budget of this regulation but I believe this is not the solution we are looking for.
As I explained in a letter to the chairmen of the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee on Development and Cooperation and to the rapporteur, we cannot meet the relatively small increase.
The resources are simply not there.
We made great efforts earlier this year in the fight against the major poverty-related diseases and in promoting sexual and reproductive health.
It is simply not possible to find any more money.
In any case, as a proposed amendment to the recitals makes clear, it is the whole of Community development-related funding which should contribute towards gender equality as a cross-cutting issue.
I need therefore to confirm to you that the Commission, fully supported by the Council, cannot accept the proposed increase in the budget.
I hope that this is also the response we will see tonight from Parliament.
I am convinced that by supporting this regulation Parliament will allow us to fund operations and agencies working to reach the international development targets to promote gender equality and empower women and contribute to poverty reduction.
The existence of this special budget line and regulation makes a lot of sense because this is where we find the inspiration and the impetus to inject a sense of direction into the mainstreaming effort, but we will never be able to do what needs to be done on the gender issue by a special budget line.
That is the reality and I appreciate the understanding of the proportions and the mechanisms of how to do this.
I hope that will be reflected in the way Parliament reacts.
I hope that we can do this in one reading in Parliament.
I would regret it very much if we could not.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out to you that this report seems to me to be absolutely fundamental.
It is fundamental because one of the prime objectives of the European Unionâs development policy is to encourage the eradication of poverty in the developing countries.
In the same way, we believe that the consolidation of democracy and of the rule of law, as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, are objectives that we should strive to achieve.
We should be deluding ourselves, however, if we were to believe that the battle against poverty can be fought without the aid of women.
Women are the pillars of society, particularly of the societies with which we are concerned here.
At the same time, it has to be said that, along with children, they are among the most vulnerable people when it comes to disease, poverty, illiteracy and war.
For this reason, all the strategies that we implement and all the projects that we want to develop must make it possible to contribute towards the emancipation and action of women in every field and in every country.
Women must participate in a very practical way in the development of their country, because each woman is a potential agent of success, change and development.
The report that we are discussing today is, I hope, one of the fundamental steps in this approach to cooperation, because it makes provision for a number of measures to promote, to develop and to support practical projects in this area.
It is important that they should be practical.
What we want this regulation to be is a catalyst, a driving force for gender-equality initiatives, capitalising on pilot initiatives, defining good practices and providing information about them.
It covers the period from 2004 to 2006.
It seems essential to us, therefore, that by January the regulation can start to be applied so that calls for tender can be issued for the projects.
I believe that there are hundreds of people out there who are waiting for our decision and, if we equivocate, the consequences will be damaging to all those involved locally who want to participate and act, in practical terms, in order to achieve equality of opportunity.
In this report, it seemed to me vital to consider, before anything else, access by women of all ages to all resources and services such as health, education, training and infrastructures.
We should also note that women are excluded from participation, access and control in all sectors.
As a woman, but above all as a democrat, I hope to be able to encourage such participation in all the countries concerned.
I also hope that the main beneficiaries of our aid will be the local agents and womenâs organisations who work tirelessly in order to bring about a change in mentality in favour of gender equality.
In everything we say, however, and in everything we hope for, there is always the budgetary aspect.
For this regulation, the European Commission has given us EUR 9Â million.
Perhaps that is not very much to us, but it represents a veritable fortune for those involved at the coalface, enabling them to undertake specific projects.
Nevertheless, we wanted to ask for EUR 11 million, because it seems to us that an additional EUR 2 million is not very much.
However, as Commissioner Nielson has just explained, it seems that this is impossible.
I therefore accepted the report at first reading, with the support of my fellow Members, in order to encourage practical action, in other words in order to get this regulation adopted as rapidly as possible, in fact tomorrow, so that it will be in force in January 2004.
It seems, however, that that is not the view of other political groups.
It seems that we shall have to go in to battle again, because we might be able to scrape together a few more pennies and that is what counts at the coalface.
I should like, however, to ask all those who are due to speak in the debate that we shall be holding in this House tomorrow to give due thought to the fact that in doing so we are taking on a clear and precise responsibility to start a second reading procedure and that we do not know how long that procedure will take.
I also think that all the organisations which are affected by our failure to reach agreement are entitled to expect from us, and from the Council and the Commission, mature behaviour and a practical indication of our desire to see these objectives attained.
As far as I am concerned, if I still have any decision-making powers as the rapporteur, I would argue once again that this text should enter into force in January 2004.
Whatever happens, if the negotiations that we shall be holding this evening and tomorrow make it necessary for us, at any given moment, to reconsider our position, I can only regret it, but in that case I shall immediately seek a meeting with the Council and the Commission so that we can reach agreement as quickly as possible.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union sets great store by equal rights for men and women and also by development cooperation policy.
We are all familiar with the poignant examples: the Nigerian woman, Amina Lawal, who was going to be stoned while her lover got off scot-free; women who, simply because they are women, have no access to loans to set up small businesses; girls who continue to be denied education because as women, they will not need it anyway and they can meanwhile help out in the home.
A great deal remains left to be done.
We incorporate it in every regulation, but âpaper is patientâ and it is difficult to implement it.
Especially in the delegations, expertise is required in this area.
I think it is somewhat disappointing that the Commission, during the review of the regulation â which lapses at the end of 2003 â presented a proposal that seeks only to act as a catalyst.
From reports of the results of previous actions, it transpired, in fact, that these were not very impressive, while moreover, the planned budget is only partly being used.
I do not want to go into the reasons for this, but I hope that this new approach, which the Commission supports, will be more effective.
Commissioner, the budget for this regulation is small, too small according to my committee, even if the Commission wants the objectives to be achieved by synergy and other actions and programmes.
I would therefore underline the fact that it is essential to have experts on the ground.
That costs money. Surely, we should be able to find the money?
This requires training and refresher training, as I heard from Peruâs delegation only last week.
However, constant requests are being made for the more effective regulation of these matters elsewhere too.
Three years is not long, but it would be good if we could say: âLook, progress is being made, more women have a prospect of a say in the political, social and economic spheres; more girls are allowed schooling and women are also entitled to good health.â
Commissioner, I am making an urgent appeal to you.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Article 3 of the Treaty sets out the European Communityâs desire to ban all forms of inequality and to promote equality between men and women.
The Council has mentioned gender equality as the basis for development cooperation.
In Beijing, a 10-point action programme on this has been adopted and has been signed by all countries.
The situation still leaves a great deal to be desired, not least in the area of development cooperation.
Of the approximately 1.5 billion people who live under the poverty line, 70% are women.
Not only are they lacking financial resources, but also, in most cases they have to go without social rights, such as the right to proper food, drinking water, education, health care and fundamental human rights.
Since the Council has defined gender mainstreaming as the guiding principle for development cooperation policy, disappointingly little has actually happened.
That is why I welcome the action programme.
It should give gender equality in development cooperation policy an extra shot in the arm.
Reference has already been made, in this Houseâs debates and documents, to the link between poverty and gender inequality.
The countries where there is great inequality between men and women are also the poorest.
There is less poverty in countries where inequality between men and women is not so pronounced.
The success rate of development projects in the fields of health care, literacy schemes and agriculture, for example, appears higher if women are involved.
Investing in girls appears to lead to lower child mortality and mortality among women, offers higher food safety and means an improvement in the fight against poverty.
This is not, unfortunately, common knowledge, and so I was pleased with the publication of research by UNICEF on 11 December last, which clearly underlined this.
The report, in fact, states that without measures to get more girls into schools, it will be impossible to achieve the millennium objectives.
It is apparent that more girls attending school not only benefits them, but also boys and their countries.
The report describes that gender discrimination stops developments in their tracks.
The report also describes that, barring a few exceptions, the industrialised countries and international financial institutions have failed to make good their own promises.
Hence my support for the action programme which aims to promote analysis and integration of the gender aspect in the priority areas of Community development cooperation, horizontal integration of the gender aspect in projects and programmes, and the advancement of gender capacity in the European Community itself.
These are three important points, particularly the last one: a change of mentality is needed, not least in the bodies of the European Union itself.
In the light of the urgency and opportunities, I am backing the amendment to increase the budget from EUR 9 million to EUR 11 million.
I sincerely hope that the Commission will be able to agree to this.
Â Â  Mr President, it has become a custom in this House for us to talk about equality between men and women during night sessions.
It does not matter, but it is a reality which is nonetheless curious to say the least.
I would like it if we could talk about equality between men and women one afternoon as well.
The policy of equality between men and women is one of the best allies in the European Unionâs commitment to combat poverty.
We have said this endless times during these night sessions, and almost all of us sitting here are convinced of it.
It is a question of making it a reality in the budget as well.
Since the nineties we have made a lot of progress with regard to these policies, but we have not yet achieved the desired results.
We all know this as well.
As the Commission's document argues, it is necessary to explore new avenues and, above all, to achieve the effective application of the measures we approve at national level, which is where we face the greatest difficulties.
While in 2001, in the action programme, we stressed the need to integrate the gender factor, that is, to consider, to draw up and to evaluate objectives in a manner which is inclusive of women, we now have to supplement that strategy by creating a solid basis for this policy linked to the millennium development objectives.
As we always reiterate, it is necessary to intensify the political message with regard to the promotion of equality between men and women, both within the Union and, above all, in the developing countries.
Poverty, illiteracy, disease, unemployment, lack of autonomy, dependency, and the violation of the most fundamental rights, are a reality for the majority of women in the developing world.
The gender perspective, specific policies, increasing awareness and support for the public and private capacities of the developing countries, so that they can take the initiative of promoting equality between men and women, are some of the measures essential to progress on this strategy.
Cross-border and regional cooperation, the promotion of a complementary policy and programmes relating, for example, to reproductive and sexual health, which are currently being seriously jeopardised by religion-based conservative policies, are essential conditions for the achievement of our objectives.
The regulation we are debating today will undoubtedly contribute to improving our action.
It has clearly been improved during its parliamentary phase, since we have insisted on key issues, such as the participation of women's organisations on the ground, which are the real protagonists in terms of the progress of their communities; also, control and access by women to training and health services and decision-making processes.
It is necessary to stress the need for technical assistance, including evaluation of the impact on equality in areas such as education, training and the media.
Combating AIDS and violence against women and giving women power are still outstanding debts.
It is necessary and urgent to adopt this regulation without excessively extending the time limits.
It is therefore necessary to reach a compromise so that the application of this regulation may be effective from January 2004.
That is what I wish to call for now.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I wish to take the opportunity of talking about girlsâ education, for without girlsâ education there is no equality for women.
Our fellow MEP, MrsÂ Martens, also mentioned that UNICEFâs report, âThe State of the World's Children, 2004â, published last week, really does make frightening reading.
We give pledge after pledge, for example in the millennium declaration.
Following the UN Special Session on Children, we undertook to reduce the difference between girls and boys where illiteracy is concerned and to giving girls good access to education.
We have had the fastÂ track initiatives within the World Bankâs Development Committee, but what is happening?
Today, we know that more than 120 million children have no schooling.
Fifteen per cent of all boys and 21% of all girls do not go to school.
In South-East Asia and in the countries south of the Sahara, the situation is particularly painful.
Under the World Bankâs fastÂ track initiatives, the developed countries approved a USDÂ 326 million funding plan last year, but, to date, only USDÂ 207 million has been given by way of appropriations.
This means a funding deficit of nearly USDÂ 118 million in a year and a half.
We have not fulfilled our pledges.
It is we in the developed countries who have not done our part.
The developing countries have put forward their plans and done what they should have done.
Among the EU countries, Italy allocates only 0.3% and Germany only 2.1% of their aid budgets to development.
It is really only the Netherlands that has fulfilled its pledges to the worldâs children.
How will matters stand after all the declarations and, in particular, following the UN Special Session on Children, at which young people themselves were present and demanded the right to education?
The sums concerned are, after all, small in comparison with those entailed in many other pledges.
I believe that the EU and the Commission combined should get their act together and fulfil their pledges made, for example, within the World Bank.
Â Â  Mr President, in relation to promoting gender equality in developing countries, it is clear that poverty is one of the issues that has to be tackled.
Women and children are worst affected by poverty, but women are the ones at the coalface who can truly make the difference.
It is quite incredible to hear the Commission here today begrudging a measly EUR 2Â million.
The Commissioner talks about the Council and the Commission â both male-dominated â deciding that they think that the EUR 2 million extra is not acceptable.
They are hoping to browbeat this Parliament into accepting what two male-dominated institutions have decided.
It is incredible when you consider that even EUR 11 million is absolute crumbs when you look at the overall budget, and yet you want this Parliament, even on first reading, to give up on that extra 2 million.
It is completely unacceptable.
I hope that Parliament tomorrow will vote an increase, as the committee did, from EUR 9 million to EUR 11Â million.
If you want to promote gender equality you have to be willing to go that extra distance to ensure that you are truly committed to it.
If you say you begrudge EUR 2 million and that you cannot find EUR 2 million in the budget to increase this budget line, it is absolutely unacceptable; and I hope that Parliament will send a strong message to the Commission and to the Council that this is no longer acceptable.
We talk about gender equality in the European Union, but we have to prove this by saying that we are willing to pay for promoting it in developing countries, to pay for supporting women in developing countries who in many cases have been persecuted and who are the ones who have been pushing to try and progress gender equality and also to alleviate poverty.
The money there is well deserved and you cannot begrudge this EUR 2Â million.
Â Â  â Mr President, the efficiency of development aid remains a problem.
Moreover, it is a fact that misplaced feelings of guilt about our colonial past have made discussion of this problem taboo, a taboo in which, fortunately, cracks are starting to appear.
An increasing number of observers, and those involved at the sharp end, take a critical view of the way in which development aid is generally organised.
The resources used often do not reach their destination.
Simply donating money is, moreover, not always the answer.
Quite the opposite, there are other factors that help determine success.
I am thinking, for example, of the presence of a free market economy and of freedom full stop.
Gender equality, the topic of this report, is a very important element in this.
It is stated, with good reason, that discrimination against women forms a barrier to sustainable and effective development.
So it is indeed the case that we should concentrate on better education, training and participation, both economically and politically speaking.
In this respect, the Commission provides for, , âsupport in terms of the analysis and improvement of statistics according to gender, age, development and distribution of methodologies, guidelines, gender impact reports, thematic studies, indicators and other operational instrumentsâ.
This is all undoubtedly useful and necessary, but we should ensure that we do not lose sight of a number of essential facts.
Many developing countries are being plagued by archaic cultural patterns to which the disadvantaged position of women is directly attributable.
In that respect, it is astonishing that neither the Zrihen report, nor the Commissionâs own, should make any reference to Islam at all.
In the Islamic world, women are, as it were, structurally inferior, and it makes no sense whatsoever to tiptoe around this unpleasant fact.
As long as people refuse to accept this, this regulation will at best be a source of employment for gender experts and other development workers from Europe, but nothing more than that.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows, the main aim of the European Unionâs development cooperation policy is to combat and ultimately eradicate poverty.
Consequently, the specific measures intended to promote equality between men and women, womenâs independence and their role in the economic, social and environmental spheres make significant contributions as well as being a matter of fairness.
This is because it is most frequently women and children who are the victims of poverty.
The progress that has already been made as a result of adopting a global strategy to mainstream the gender perspective in development cooperation should be acknowledged and underlined, but much remains to be done.
There are aspects that are crucial to gender equality and womenâs independence and it is to these that particular attention must be paid, with particular emphasis on areas such as health, education, training, access to economic and social activities, and also access to employment and to infrastructures and participation in decision-making processes.
The projects must be in line with reality and to achieve this we must have data and statistics that are broken down by gender, which will enable us to evaluate actions before they are selected and once they have been undertaken.
We must highlight the crucial role of organisations working in the field, taking account of their direct and more extensive knowledge of the real needs and of the means needed to undertake actions.
Another point that I would underline is the need to create partnerships.
The key actors, including regional authorities, should form networks in order to exchange experience, and good practice so as to define actions better and to achieve better participation in their implementation.
To conclude, I wish to emphasise that promoting gender equality in development cooperation for the 2004-2006 period must be given a budget that matches the needs.
I understand the reasons that the Commission has put forward in this debate and by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, but, taking account of the measures that still need to be implemented and the efforts that still need to be made, the corresponding budget line must be increased to EURÂ 11Â million.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by thanking the rapporteur for producing this report.
The European Union has declared gender equality to be one of its key objectives, and I think it is extremely important that this priority be factored into development cooperation.
It is still predominantly women and girls who can neither read nor write and who are discriminated against in education.
Education, however, is the key to escaping from the vicious cycle of poverty and illness.
Anyone unable to read and write has no chance in our computerâ and Internet-dominated world.
Whatever happens, it is essential that in promoting equal opportunities, we ensure that all women benefit, regardless of age.
The report concentrates primarily on strengthening existing local organisations, because they have the experts on the ground, the experts on the underlying structures, who know what is really needed there.
Women are indispensable in all rural areas and essential to further development in the regions. As previous speakers have already pointed out, women in developing countries are often given a passive role in projects and planning processes.
This means they do not have enough input into projects, and consequently less attention is given to the needs of women.
Women therefore need to be included as active participants in local planning processes, so that they can actively shape their environment and so they can also take on new challenges with 100% commitment.
As has already been said, the financial framework for implementing this regulation needs to contain the EUR 11 million, in order to introduce efficient measures that will also have an effect when implemented.
I therefore ask Parliament to approve these EUR 11 million tomorrow.
Gender mainstreaming may well be over-used as a term, and perhaps seems to have worn thin at times, but it is still a fundamental concept which must be applied to all policy areas.
Â Â  . â Mr President, not with pleasure but with some regret, I will start by saying that Mrs McKenna's choice of language is disappointing.
I do not accept that the Commission is male-dominated.
This is outside the scope of how we work professionally in this field.
This is not nice, and it is also factually wrong.
We do things in this area which are not normally or not always labelled as gender activity.
We are engaged in land reform issues and changing legislation in many countries without describing this as gender action.
However, it is extremely important to devise modern legislation that creates equal rights on land ownership and, for a country like Kenya which decided to go for free primary education in one big step, to provide budget support that makes it possible for girls to benefit from that opening.
The budget support of EUR 50 million for Kenya was not labelled gender support but, in reality, this is hard-core, big-money, gender-relevant policies.
This is mainstreaming.
I must insist that this is where the big battle is being fought.
I could understand the discussion here if this was about the distinction between 9 and 200 million euros, rather than about the distinction between 9 and 11Â million euros.
Then I would see some sort of logic in what has been said here tonight.
But the budget line on this specific activity is a catalyst for moving forward good new ideas, innovative approaches, etc., to inspire the more general work on mainstreaming.
That is why it is a mistake to move the money level as such up and down.
I would very much regret it if Parliament did not act on this issue in a manner that will create a smooth and rapid decision-making process.
It is a mistake to think that the attitude and the sincerity of the fight for gender equality is reflected in a choice between 9 or 11Â million euros.
We must be judged by our general work and we are relatively confident of that judgement.
Â Â  Mr President, no personal offence to the Commissioner â as male Commissioners go, he is probably one of the more progressive concerning gender equality.
But the reality is that both the Commission and the Council are male-dominated.
When we look at the numbers, both are basically dominated by men.
If we had more equality both in the Commission and in the Council in relation to the number of women, things would be a bit different.
This is not a personal attack on you, Commissioner.
In relation to women's issues you are better than some of our Commissioners, including Mr PÃ¡draig Flynn, who was here a few years ago!
The reality is nevertheless that the Commission and Council are male-dominated.
Â Â  We shall treat that as an olive branch.
That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0465/2003) by Friedrich-Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the coexistence of genetically modified crops and conventional and organic crops (2003/2098(INI)).
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this is an own-initiative report tabled by Parliament at the request of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
It is therefore not a response to a legislative proposal from the Commission.
Rather, we feel that this matter requires action and that is why we have taken the trouble to draft this report.
The report represents a compromise achieved through cooperation by all groups and one that has been adopted with overwhelming support by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
At this point, I would like to thank each of my co-rapporteurs: MrsÂ Schierhuber, Mrs Scheele, Mr Olsson, and MrÂ Garot.
We have all sought to allow objectivity to rule while working on this Parliamentary task.
Let me emphasise once again that this report does not ask whether genetic modification should be allowed.
It focuses on coexistence.
It has already been decided, in consultation with this House, that genetically modified organisms will exist and will be released.
The question we are considering here is how there can be cooperation, coexistence, and freedom of choice both for farmers and for consumers, for that will become the issue if we release genetically modified organisms in plants or animals.
Nature does often tend towards exchange â it will not make any allowances for genetically modified organisms.
So, rather than concentrating on the fact that very soon there will be a release of genetically modified plants and animals, we now need to ensure there are GMO-free plants and animals to allow freedom of choice.
That is what this report is about.
We need to make sure that all procedures are clarified before they are implemented.
The Commission has not put forward any legislative proposals to this end â instead guidelines have been proposed.
We are now trying to implement those guidelines, as stated in the report.
We call on the Commission to investigate the technical requirements, to consult scientific experts, and also to address the question of potential liability.
The fact is that, while industry is perfectly entitled to make money, it cannot be allowed to do so if, lower down the chain, farmers are suing one another.
There must be clarity.
The reactions to this legislation indicate that some regions want to declare themselves GM-free, because they are concerned about the possibility of contamination between small plots â this relates to Article 26 of the release directive, introduced as a result of Parliamentâs efforts, which states farmers must have the right to establish a GMO-free region provided they have established that food and feed with over 0.9% contamination will be labelled as genetically modified.
All those who want to operate on the market â not just the organic holdings, which are legally required to be GM-free, but also large sections of conventional agriculture â see this as part of their market.
They are fully entitled to do so.
Everyone has to make their own choice on this matter, and we have to ensure that they can do so.
This is why we are now proposing regulation for liability.
I hope that a large majority in this House will approve this report tomorrow, that the Commission will then meet our expectations and that these questions about coexistence will be dealt with using the codecision procedure, as happened with the legislation on genetic modification.
This will allow us to be included and use our expert knowledge â which is evident in this report â to come up with reasonable legislation that does not allow coexistence to become a Trojan horse.
We do not want to fund ourselves a couple of years down the line concluding with regret that our approach has not worked.
We need to guarantee the long-term nature of coexistence and freedom of choice for farmers and consumers.
I hope that the Commission will take our work seriously and that we will soon have a legislative proposal on this subject for this House to discuss.
One last thought: a key factor in this area is whether non-GM seed lines remain free of genetically modified organisms.
There is no doubt that genetically modified seed will exist.
We have legislation on the subject.
However, we also need to ensure that GM-free seed exists.
This, then, is the crux for coexistence.
Our report places great emphasis on this point.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to start by apologising as I see from the timetable that I have been allocated two and a half minutes, but in fact I have a prepared statement which is somewhat more thorough.
Not having known this in advance, I feel obliged to go for substance rather than time management.
Firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the Members of Parliament who have contributed to this own-initiative report.
The Commission welcomes this report as a timely contribution to the discussion on coexistence.
I fully share the opinion that coexistence is a highly important issue that needs to be addressed in a transparent and open-minded way.
With the new GMO authorisation procedure and the legislation on traceability and labelling, the European Union has created a comprehensive regulatory framework that should clear the way for the introduction of GMOs in agriculture.
By establishing the conditions for coexistence we must ensure that farmers who want to use conventional and organic farming methods should be able to do so.
The report comes at a time when several Member States are in the process of preparing national and regional approaches to coexistence.
It also comes at a time when the Commission is seeking to further clarify how it can best engage with the Member States in supporting this process, following the publication of the Commission recommendation on guidelines for coexistence last July.
While the Commission welcomes the own-initiative report as a valuable overall contribution to the discussion in terms of the individual statements and recommendations put forward, there are only a few we can wholeheartedly endorse.
I shall comment briefly on some of them.
Concerning thresholds for seeds, we would agree that information on the presence of GMOs in seeds is necessary for the proper implementation of the GMO legislation, especially regarding labelling and traceability.
However, the thresholds apply only to adventitious traces of authorised GMOs that have undergone extensive environmental and health-risk assessment.
They are not meant to be a risk management tool.
We also recognise the importance and urgency of defining thresholds for the adventitious presence of GMOs in seed lots of non-GM varieties and we are currently working on a proposal.
In doing so, we are basing ourselves on sound scientific advice building on the preparatory work that has been carried out over the last two years.
I am pleased to see that the report has replaced a previous draft text recommending a 0.1% threshold for seeds by a new text that takes account of scientific assessments regarding practical applicability.
The Commission has always been of the opinion that thresholds should be feasible and practicable in a GMO environment.
It has always insisted on the fact that sound scientific advice was needed in order to set thresholds.
Regarding the request for uniform and binding rules for coexistence at Community level, we are not convinced that this would be a feasible solution.
Given the diversity that characterises European agriculture, we believe that it would be impossible to establish uniform rules that can be applied across the board.
A 'one size fits all' approach is not appropriate.
Scientists have repeatedly supported the subsidiarity-based approach, also at the preliminary hearing on coexistence organised in September 2003.
Member States also increasingly see this as the appropriate way forward.
Moreover, with the insertion of an Article on coexistence into Directive 2001/18/EC at the request of the European Parliament, Member States now have the possibility to adopt measures for coexistence.
With this clause for national coexistence measures in place and the Commission guidelines available, we believe that the framework for national solutions to coexistence is sufficiently elaborated.
Coexistence cannot be a reason to further delay the authorisation of new GMOs.
I do not share the opinion expressed in the report that Member States should be obliged to put in place legislation to ensure coexistence.
On the contrary, we should leave it up to them to explore the use of different policy instruments, including voluntary agreements and soft-law approaches and to choose the combination of instruments and depth of regulation that best suits them under their specific conditions.
On the question of who should be responsible for implementing the necessary measures we are in complete agreement.
In fact, the Commission guidelines state that the farmers who introduce a new production type should bear this responsibility.
This principle is mutual, although at the beginning it will mainly concern farmers who want to grow GMOs.
Regarding liability, I have difficulty understanding why Community-wide civil liability rules should be necessary.
The question of liability cannot be dealt with in isolation.
Liability is conditioned by the overall approach to coexistence taken by the Member State.
It should therefore be addressed as an integral part of the package of national coexistence measures.
A general levy on GM seeds and feed, to cover administrative expenditures, as well as the testing and monitoring costs associated with GMO legislation, would not be compatible with the principle of the common market.
As a general principle, the marketing of products that are authorised under Community legislation and found safe for human health and the environment, should not be restricted or impeded by the Member States.
Of course taxation is here to stay â we tax many things in terms of economic activity as a whole, and so, logically, I would say that this discussion is not so strange.
The report asks the Commission to establish legally-binding definitions of the terms 'adventitious' and 'technically unavoidable'.
Our legislation is clear on this: operators must be in a position to show that they have tried to avoid the presence of GMOs.
Concerning the issue of cross-border effects, the Commission could agree that this needs to be further examined.
We will reflect on how this can be done and what contribution the Commission can make.
We can also establish whether drawing up a public register of national strategies and best practices with cross-border impacts would be useful.
As regards GMO-free zones, we have a different view.
We strongly feel that a blanket ban of all types of GMOs from a region is not possible, unless it is on a voluntary basis.
The regional restriction of certain types of GMOs needs to be scientifically justified on a crop-by-crop basis and should only be a last resort if farm-level management measures are insufficient.
The Commission agrees that more research is needed on coexistence.
It therefore supports scientific studies conducted by the joint research centre and under the sixth framework programme for Community research.
These studies will cover cost analysis, good farming practices for coexistence and liability issues.
However, a comprehensive report covering all economic aspects of coexistence under the different cost conditions in the EU will only be possible once the Member States have more practical experience.
The Commission will ensure a coordination role and facilitate the exchange of information concerning best practices and concrete experiences with coexistence among Member States, including cross-border aspects.
Based on this collection of data it will report to the European Parliament and the Council in two years' time.
The Commission will then, if appropriate, also make an assessment of possible and necessary steps to take.
I am pleased to have had the opportunity to give this thorough response.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, nearly six months have passed since the question of coexistence last played a leading role in this House.
Back then we were discussing the regulation on genetically modified food and feed.
I was the rapporteur, and we had to battle with the Commission and certain Member States in order to secure the flexibility in the form of Article 26a.
We were successful, and I congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, whose own-initiative report on the subject sends another important political signal from this House.
I think it is incredibly important that we now call on the Member States to make use of and give shape to that flexibility which we in Parliament fought for on their behalf.
However, I also agree with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that it will be necessary to establish European regulations on coexistence.
I do not understand how the Commission can say it is able to authorise this centrally, and has the competence to do so, when it does not know the answers to the questions raised by coexistence.
Another reason that I think Mr Graefe zu Baringdorfâs own-initiative report is incredibly important is that very soon there will be a vote on the Seed Directive under the comitology procedure, which, unfortunately, leaves Parliament out of it.
I also think that the section in which we state that the pollution value for seeds is determined by the proximity value is extremely important.
We should not reproach ourselves: the threshold value we agreed â 0.9% â is very hard to maintain, even if we do not require absolute seed purity.
Consequently I hope that tomorrow this House will be able to send this important political signal.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for genuinely taking the initiative in producing this own-initiative report on coexistence, and for successfully bringing together all points of view in one report.
The fact is that opinions on coexistence vary from one country to the next, and even within my group we cannot agree on the subject.
Let us be clear: it was a long time now that the question stopped being about whether we say âyesâ or ânoâ to genetic engineering.
The rapporteur has said that.
That question has long been decided.
We need to look ahead and are already discussing how there can be coexistence between GM and non-GM crops, and how to ensure that all parties can operate side by side without anyone being disadvantaged.
Coexistence ought to guarantee freedom of choice for farmers and consumers, and clear rules need to be created for the benefit of all European farmers, allowing each to make an independent choice about which different farming methods to use, and ensuring those methods can coexist without generating problems.
After intensive cross-party and internal discussions, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs has reached a compromise and has approved a report containing specific, clear demands.
Our own-initiative report calls for comprehensive regulation at Community level, since the guidelines proposed by the Commission are a collection of non-binding recommendations.
We therefore expect the Commission, where policy is determined at Community level, as in the case of agricultural policy, to provide a common regulatory framework.
Another important feature in our report is the call for the Commission to submit a proposal for Community-wide liability and insurance.
Provision must be made in advance to cover the possibility of adventitious contamination, rather than simply leaving the farmers to sort it out between themselves, and the devil take the hindmost.
There is no way the question of liability should be left to the farmers to resolve.
In addition, GMO contamination in seed must be established using technically viable and accurate threshold values, in order to ensure that agricultural production complies with the existing labelling threshold of 0.9% for food.
This subject has already been addressed by Mrs Scheele.
An own-initiative report is one way in which Parliament can send a clear political signal.
If we now water down the demands and comments made by the Committee on Agriculture and unwrap the existing package, our demands will no longer be clear.
Instead, we will have a hotchpotch of vague statements without any clear shape.
As MEPs, we need to ask ourselves whether we really want to send out a political signal with no actual content.
I therefore join the rapporteur in hoping that this own-initiative report will be adopted tomorrow with a genuinely convincing majority, since it has already received so much support in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Affairs.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, we are not concerned here with the continued existence, or otherwise, of genetically modified organisms.
I am among those who believe that neither humanity as a whole nor its merely European component can do without this knowledge and technology.
It is, however, very important that we apply the precautionary and âpolluter paysâ principles and that we respect peopleâs anxiety faced with something new.
We must therefore be able to label GMOs and provide proper information about them.
We have had, and still have, different views on the point at issue, but I nonetheless wish to congratulate MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringdorf on this report.
We have substantially been able to agree upon an attitude to be adopted by the European Parliament, and I hope that this will give a signal to the Commission and the Council.
I think that the report is very well balanced, but I have some comments to make.
I am disappointed when I hear the Commissioner so positively come out against paragraphÂ 3 on common rules.
The wind does in actual fact blow across national borders.
It is not sensible to have one rule apply on one side of a national border and another rule on the other side.
We are concerned here with life and with what life consists of.
If we wish to achieve something by what we are doing, we must have common rules.
Think about it in the Commission before you make any over-hasty decisions.
I am able, however, to go some way towards agreeing with the Commission when it comes to paragraphÂ 9.
I believe it would be dangerous to continue with a moratorium if we do not get what we want.
I actually agree with paragraphÂ 9, but I consider that it perhaps goes a little too far.
I am not prepared to vote in favour of that paragraph.
It is the only paragraph in the report about which I take a different view.
When it comes to regional renunciation, the Commissioner says that it can only become a reality if it is voluntary.
In my simplicity, I had imagined that democratic decisions were always voluntary.
Does that not, then, mean that there can be no cause for concern?
I believe that a region or country is entitled to say âwe do not want thisâ.
We cannot compel people to use a technology if they do not wish to do so, even if I consider the technology to be a sound one.
It is very important that we give out this signal and that we can be in relative agreement tomorrow when we take a decision.
We certainly have different views on the continued existence, or otherwise, of genetically modified organisms, but we wish to be cautious.
We now wish to come up with a proposal on how to arrange for coexistence, and this with a view to our being credible in the eyes of all those who have to live on the food that is produced in either one way or another.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental issue we are addressing here is whether coexistence between genetically modified crops and conventional and organic crops is truly possible.
Unless we find a practical and precise answer to this question, there can be no basis for the much-vaunted freedom of choice.
Farmers who produce conventional and organic crops will have no choice and consumers will have no choice if genetically modified crops affect conventional and organic crops.
We must not allow our hand to be forced by a powerful lobby consisting of an increasingly limited group of huge multinationals that market genetically modified crops and which seek to control agriculture and food production against the wishes of European farmers and consumers who, in countless opinion polls, have already expressed their reservations and even fear about genetically modified organisms.
I therefore welcome this own-initiative report by Parliament, which is all the more important because the Commission itself was delaying this debate.
The report also opens the way for the moratorium that has existed since 1998 to be lifted.
As a matter of fact, this is a demand that I myself made in a joint-initiative resolution with members of my group in March 2003.
Everyone is aware of the inherent risks of contamination from the release of GMOs into the environment.
Scientific studies on cross-pollination and the dissemination of GMOs are still too limited for us to have a precise and reliable evaluation of all the consequences.
Throughout this debate, however, bearing in mind the opinions presented at the parliamentary hearing, the conclusion we are bound to reach is that contamination cannot really be avoided in the large-scale presence of genetically modified crops, with consequences ranging from the loss of biodiversity to economic damage to conventional and organic farming.
Consequently, despite the risk of dissemination varying according to the type of genetically modified crop, their management cannot be efficiently and viably contained.
A farm that opts for a genetically modified crop cannot then revert to conventional or organic farming.
Our experiences with animal disease, specifically BSE and Foot-and-Mouth disease should serve as warnings of the problems of reliability and cost that will face the monitoring systems that are put in place.
Consequently, as the rapporteur states in his report â on which I congratulate him â the most effective and economic way of ensuring coexistence is the renunciation, whether voluntary or restricted at regional level, of GMO cultivation.
Furthermore, the Community provisions established cannot jeopardise every Member Stateâs right to ban genetically modified crops throughout their territory or in geographically limited areas.
What is obvious in this entire process is that, if coexistence is not possible, the moratorium should remain in place in order to observe the precautionary principle.
We should consequently support at least itemÂ 9 of this report and I personally hope that Parliament will tomorrow adopt the report in its entirety.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have added two amendments to the report.
These would entail the Member States being instructed (paragraph 7 a [new]) or recommended (paragraph 7 b [new]) to introduce a levy on GMO seed and GMO feed.
The revenue would cover day-to-day administration and the testing of farmersâ organically farmed and non-GMO conventional land.
The revenue would also compensate for damage caused by GMO pollution which occurs despite correct practice on the part of GMO farmers.
I would emphasise that the damage occurring despite correct practice must also be covered by the polluter and not by the public authorities via taxes paid by innocent citizens.
It must, however, be possible for a Member State to be exempted if a decision to that effect is taken at a public national parliamentary sitting in the Member State concerned and is presented by the Head of Government to an EU Council meeting.
In this way, the Member Statesâ sovereignty would be guaranteed, at the same time as its being possible for a grassroots-based environmental campaign to achieve results across borders.
Â Â  Mr President, taking into account the extent of the various problems posed by GMOs, on which there are no obvious and convincing scientific conclusions, the issue of the coexistence of GMO production and non-GMO production should be thought of as a long-term issue and not as a temporary situation which we have to manage while we wait for GMO production to assert itself as the dominant, or even exclusive, method of crop production.
It is conventional farming and organic farming which are the rule, and GMO production which is the exception under observation, and not the other way round.
We need to ask questions, not about the viability of non-GMO production, but about the precautions to be taken to protect that production from contamination by GMOs.
The rapporteur is right to emphasise the proven insufficiency of our knowledge in a series of crucial areas, which should encourage us, admittedly, to continue the research, but also to behave with great caution.
We are looking here at cross-fertilisation (outcrossing), overwintering of seed, soil concentration, resistance, diffusion and dissemination.
We must be extremely vigilant in order to avoid a situation in which the provisions adopted on authorisation, traceability and labelling are circumvented by other provisions, on coexistence, which are too vague, uncertain or unclear, thereby creating a which would sweep away all those precautionary provisions.
Let us be careful not to place our farmers in the position of sorcererâs apprentices, to which public opinion would undoubtedly attribute the negative consequences of any generalised dissemination of GMOs.
They have already sacrificed much, with animal meal and Gaucho insecticide.
Let us ensure, therefore, that we do not make the continued use of traditional crop production methods so complicated that farmers will be driven to abandon them in favour of GMO production.
It is up to the person who introduces a high-risk crop to assume responsibility for all the consequences of that risk.
It is the person who takes the risk of possible contamination who must bear the costs of preventing and managing that risk to other crops and to the users of those crops, and who alone must shoulder the responsibility for having taken that risk.
This question of how to manage the coexistence of the various production methods is set to become an issue of vital importance in regional planning.
It must be possible to have the freedom to choose specific guidelines at national or regional level.
If, for example, elected representatives, farmers and others involved at regional level in a certain area want that area to be GMO-free, they must be able to decide that in complete freedom, without the Commission putting obstacles in their path in the name of heaven knows what distortion of competition which may be to a greater or lesser extent imaginary.
Therefore, Mr President, we shall be voting in favour of this initiative report, which asks some valid questions on a subject which is vitally important to our society.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on having drafted an excellent report by way of good cooperation, the urgent need for which is evident from the Commissionerâs reaction.
He did indeed note that it is a topical subject, but is, at the same time, increasingly pushing the responsibility away from the Commission.
This responsibility is said to lie with the Member States and others.
However, this is a subject for action at Community level.
Commissioner, Parliament is on your side and, in the discussion about the European Constitution too, it would be very beneficial if the Commission and Parliament could reach sound agreements in good cooperation.
Something else struck me in the Commissionerâs reaction.
He mentioned organic farming.
But, Commissioner, the European Unionâs own knowledge centre has calculated that in the event of the uncontrolled use of this genetic technology, also in traditional farming, costs would rise from 1 to 41% depending on the crop, because we have no idea how the consumer will react.
This is also why, before we obtain further legislation, we should examine the implications more closely, not only on the farm but also in the sale of the products.
How does the consumer react?
We know too little about this.
It is essential that we should acquire this very piece of knowledge before we can launch into using this technology in Europe.
Not only do we need to know what the impact on organic farming is, but also on traditional farming, and also how the consumers will react to this.
After all, we have a House with a common agricultural policy that boasts many regional products and a large diversity in Europe, greater than anywhere in the world.
This means that the risks involved in using this technology will also be greater than anywhere in the world.
This means that we need Community policy in this area more than ever.
In the light of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorfâs sterling report, I would ask the Commission, in its capacity as an important European institution, to accept this task with renewed dynamism and table sound proposals following thorough research, in order to achieve truly sound legislation.
Â Â  â Mr President, today's debate clearly shows how the pressure exerted by Bush last summer is being fleshed out.
Not only for the movement of genetically modified organisms, but also for their free cultivation in the European Union.
I should like to state from the outset our categorical opposition to the cultivation of genetically modified products and to point out for the umpteenth time the hypocrisy of the Commission which, at a time when it is implementing the reform of the CAP, supposedly with the basic principle of improving the quality of agricultural produce in order to guarantee healthy and safe food, environmental protection etc., it is, on the other hand, promoting the cultivation of modified products.
The most typical example of its hypocrisy is tobacco for which, on the pretext of protecting public health and sustainable development, subsidies are being slashed in a bid to abolish the crop definitively.
Recently, Mr Michael Meacher, the minister for the environment in the first Blair government, made a statement, which was published in the British newspaper , in which he said he could not see how the Blair government could responsibly issue licences for modified crops.
All the evidence from research has proven negative and this position on the part of Mr Meacher is particularly significant in that in 1999 â while he was minister â he started up extensive trial crops of genetically modified plants.
Of the 210 fields cultivated, half were modified and half were conventional.
The results of the research are particularly revelatory of the possible risks to the environment and consumer health.
Even the basic argument of the multinational companies which produce genetically modified seed, mainly in the USA, has proven to be trite.
During the course of the trials, which lasted several years, not only was there no reduction in the need for insecticides, but also the special insecticides required for the genetically modified crops proved to be more harmful than those required for conventional crops.
Research has shown that modified rape, maize and sugar beet plants damage the flora and fauna far more than conventional crops.
In addition, the Nobel prizewinner Professor Sherwood Rowland, has typically remarked that, as soon as modified organisms are released into the environment and it is ascertained that they are damaging the environment, it is impossible to stop their harmful effect.
Modified organisms will continue, constantly multiplying, to wreak havoc as weapons of mass environmental destruction.
The objective of the report by the European Parliament is essentially to get the idea across that genetically modified organisms can coexist with conventional and ecological products, raising certain questions concerning the preconditions and arrangements for coexistence, while it knows full well that numerous studies point out that it is exceptionally difficult, impossible if you like, to protect against contamination when these crops coexist.
As for hypocritically citing the 'polluter pays' principle, I do not understand, on the one hand, what calculations can be used to evaluate either the possible environmental cost and the damage to consumer health while I fear, on the other hand, that they will ultimately heap the blame indirectly, if not clearly, on the producers themselves.
Finally, Mr President, the European Parliament has just one obligation European farmers, consumers and the environment â to say a categorical and overall ânoâ to the cultivation of modified crops.
Only thus could it fulfil its role, by allowing pressure from the USA, the objective of which is to serve the interests of its multinationals, so that they can amass profits at the expense of the peoples' health and the environment, to fall on stony ground.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we would like to commend you for working so hard on this subject.
As you have heard, we do not agree with you, but had you already shared our views, we would not have had to compile this report.
This debate is just beginning, and I hope we will see a genuinely positive process between the Commission and Parliament.
Please pass this on to those colleagues who deal with this area.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0459/2003) by Struan Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters extending to the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 the validity of the protocol setting fishing opportunities and a financial contribution as provided for in the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of CÃŽte d'Ivoire on fishing off the coast of CÃŽte d'Ivoire (COM(2003) 556 â C5-0458/2003 â 2003/0219(CNS)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Member for this report on the extension for one year of the fisheries protocol to the agreement between the Community and CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
I am happy to note that you support the spirit of this proposal, since the Commission â for political and social reasons â has had to proceed with an extension instead of a renewal of the protocol.
Unfortunately, due to the difficult political situation in the autumn 2002 and spring 2003, it was not possible to proceed with negotiations.
The protocol is important for the EU fishing industry, which fishes and uses the port of Abidjan to land their catches from the whole region and not only from Ivorian waters.
This, in turn, is an advantage for CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
The protocol also supports scientific research, which is essential for ensuring the sustainability of the fisheries and for building up capacity to administer this in the country.
Because of the previous protocol, European businesses have made investments in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
There are now three tuna canneries in the port of Abidjan which process tuna for the European market.
They generate over 30Â 000 local jobs.
The one-year extension of the protocol provides fishing possibilities for 71 tuna vessels and some demersal fishing as well.
The targeted measures remain the same and represent 71% of the financial contribution out of an overall contribution that is also kept at the previous level â EUR 957Â 500.
Considering the good level of utilisation of the tuna fisheries on the one hand, and the ministry's use of targeted measures to ensure sustainable fisheries, the Commission considers the extension to be good value for money.
This is true for both sides.
Obviously, one cannot be fully satisfied with the fact that this extension, which has been in operation since 1 July 2003, was only presented to this Parliament on 23Â September.
One reason for this delay was that the letter of extension was signed by Ivorian Fisheries Minister only on 16 May 2003.
However, I would add, in all honesty and fairness, that these delays are never the result of one of the partners alone.
I express my regret for the delay.
If I were a Member of this House I would look at this with some scepticism.
However, I am happy to know that on 24 November you received an evaluation report on the implementation of the protocol, which answers some of your requests for future negotiations on the renewal of the protocol.
The report submitted is a study assessing the fish stocks and the application of the protocol up to August 2003.
Concerning Amendments Nos 1 and 2, the Commission fully shares the concern to keep Parliament informed on various aspects of the implementation of the protocol.
However, the Commission already forwards this kind of information, in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements and, in particular, with the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament of 5 July 2000.
Therefore, the Commission considers that these two amendments are not necessary.
Concerning Amendment No 3, the agreement, according to Article 13 thereof, shall be renewable for additional periods of 3 years, unless notice of termination is given in writing by either of the parties.
However, the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution is only valid for three years and will have to be renewed after that period.
If the amendment refers to the renewal of the protocol and not of the agreement as such, the amendment goes against the principles regarding the nature of the protocols to the fisheries agreements.
Since the protocols are annexed to the framework agreements, their periodical renewal does not require any new directive for negotiations.
Concerning Amendment No 4, considering the importance of the fisheries agreement for CÃŽte d'Ivoire â in terms of the 30Â 000 jobs generated by EU canneries in Abidjan, and the fact that the financial contribution goes mainly to scientific research, control and surveillance â not extending the agreement would be a disaster for the country.
It would also be a serious problem for EU fishermen and the investments made in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Failing to extend the agreement would mean isolating CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
This is not the sign the EU wants to give to a country which is struggling to find a way back to peace.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very fulsome presentation.
One of the great pleasures of chairing the Committee on Fisheries is having to come here late at night to address an empty chamber on international fisheries agreements with far flung corners of the globe.
This is no exception.
However, this evening's debate on CÃŽte d'Ivoire has been provoked, not on the usual matters relating to third-country fisheries agreements, but by the Verts/ALE and ELDR groups, who have expressed quite legitimate concerns over the current civil war in that country, and their fears that Community funding should not be sent to a zone of conflict lest it pour petrol on the flames.
As the House will know, the main rebel army in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, who call themselves the New Forces, signed a French-brokered peace deal with Prime Minister Seydou Diarra last January.
Sadly, this peace pact partially crumbled in September when the New Forces walked out of the government, accusing President Laurent Gbagbo of hoarding power and refusing to implement the conditions of the peace pact.
Meanwhile, President Gbagbo has announced his intention to liberate rebel-held zones in the North and West of the country should the New Forces refuse to disarm.
That is the position of CÃŽte d'Ivoire today.
It is against this rather unfavourable background that my report on the Commission's proposal seeks to extend the current fisheries agreement between the Community and CÃŽte d'Ivoire for a further year, although the period actually commenced last July â as Commissioner Nielson pointed out â before the Parliament had even been consulted.
The Commissioner said that Members of Parliament would find that this was disagreeable, and that is indeed the case.
Being bounced into these again and again by the Commission is extremely disagreeable.
Indeed in this case, payment to CÃŽte d'Ivoire is due on 31 December 2003.
So there is therefore a considerable need for urgency in settling this matter.
It is regrettable that the Fisheries Committee was forced into this position once again.
I trust, however, the Commission appreciates the efforts we have made to accelerate the process in order that this contract can be honoured in time.
This agreement will be the sixth successive protocol between the EU and Ivory Coast.
We first entered into a fisheries partnership with them in 1990 and have continued on an amicable basis ever since.
However, inevitably â as Commissioner Nielson said â the political instability in the region resulted in our inability to take up some of the demersal fishing opportunities which we had negotiated in 2002.
However, as the situation stabilised, it was possible for this fishery to resume again.
Tuna fishing, which is the other major resource covered by this agreement, was never affected by the civil war and, in terms of the uptake of opportunities negotiated under the agreement, we have continued at a level of around 85%.
As Commissioner Nielson pointed out, there are 71 licences available for tuna vessels, although as always in these partnership agreements, over 70% of the financial compensation goes to targeted actions ensuring the continuation of a sustainable fishery and underpinning conservation measures, scientific research and control and surveillance.
These funds are closely monitored by the Commission to ensure compliance with the objectives of the protocol.
In the absence of this agreement, we could not guarantee that a sustainable fishery would continue.
Indeed we could see a complete free-for-all with IUU fishing causing the complete plunder of the stocks and the collapse of the fishery.
It is important for those who oppose the renewal of this contract to understand the implications of their opposition.
Commissioner Nielson highlighted that there are three large tuna canneries in Abidjan, funded by EU investment.
Indeed, Abidjan is the focus for much of the tuna landings in West Africa and if, as the Verts/ALE and ELDR Groups suggest, we pull out of this agreement, 5000 direct jobs â and up to 30Â 000 indirect jobs â would disappear.
Such an outcome would have catastrophic consequences for the social situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire and would seriously destabilise the country, plunging it into further conflict.
So, I appeal to the Verts/ALE and ELDR Groups to think again and withdraw their amendments which would only make a bad situation worse.
Â Â  â Mr President, like the chairman of our Committee on Fisheries, I too have the privilege of speaking late this evening and I have the special privilege of acting on behalf of my coordinator, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna.
I should like to concur with what the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has said, also in relation to the very difficult issue that is being discussed there.
If you consider the situation in those coastal strips with much domestic unrest and wars, it remains to be seen to what extent we, once the situation has improved, can also employ fisheries policy to improve the situation in the country itself.
Provided the money we invest in the fisheries agreements is well spent, Europe could play a greater role on that score too.
On behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I am disappointed about the amendments on this subject tabled by the Liberal Group.
I would have preferred to see more of a social component in them, and I back anything that can improve the situation in the African countries in relation to fisheries agreements.
However, it is essential for all aspects to be discussed in depth.
Once again, though, I wish to concur with the words of the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries.
I have also noticed that these are widely supported, and I would ask the Commission on the one hand, for an all-out effort for the African countries, including a wise spending plan of the money from the fisheries agreements, but on the other, we consider it essential for the social components also to be taken into consideration.
I am therefore looking forward to the Commissionâs reaction, as well as Parliamentâs.
Â Â  Mr President, today we in this Parliament have adopted a resolution on the Union's role in the prevention of conflicts in Africa, and in particular, in the application of the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement in Ivory Coast.
In this resolution the European Parliament calls on all the conflicting parties to scrupulously apply the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement.
The European Union has a responsibility in terms of preventing conflicts, and its various policies aimed at promoting commercial relations between Europe and developing countries represent a form of preventing this type of conflict.
Commercial and human relations bring peoples closer together, contribute to their development and the development of their different economic sectors.
My group therefore supports the fisheries agreement, because commercial agreements and relations between peoples promote peace and, in the case of fisheries agreements, also the development of the fisheries sector in the developing countries.
We therefore support this report by Mr Stevenson in favour of a one-year extension of the current protocol, with the amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries.
Ivory Coast is a country at civil war which we must help so that it can achieve peace and economic progress.
We Socialists therefore believe that the message we are sending through the extension of this fisheries agreement is a positive one.
The war is not a reason to put an end to a fisheries agreement.
If we did that it would be absurd and would increase the suffering of that country, and the same thinking would lead us to suspend imports of its products, such as coffee, cocoa or palm oil and, also, to suspend emerging oil operations and not to buy any more of its diamonds, its manganese, its iron, its cobalt, bauxite or copper.
Why is there this insistence on putting an end to commercial fisheries agreements which bring the European Union closer to the developing countries and then to promote exports from those countries of agricultural products, for example, and also minerals, oil or gas?
Despite the war, the execution of the quotas allocated by the agreement, as in the case of tuna, has been good, and the level of catches of demersal species is improving.
We in the Socialist Group believe that this agreement is of great benefit to the port of Abidjan, which is the largest tuna-fishing base in West Africa, where catches are the raw material for a large local processing industry which is a key element in Ivory Coastâs development.
I believe that this is a good agreement illustrating how, in the case of a country which is faced with serious difficulties, fisheries agreements can operate well for both parties, the European Union and the developing country which is signing it with us.
Â Â  Mr President, since I first raised this question it has been interesting to see, in terms of language, how the approach of Members of Parliament and the Commission has actually changed.
The Commission came to the Committee on Fisheries and said 'We have no way of negotiating a new agreement so we shall just extend it for another year'.
Members indicated that the aim of this was to allow EU vessels to continue fishing despite the conflict.
You are now actually trying to give the impression that this is somehow about helping the people in CÃŽte d'Ivoire: the reality is that this is about helping ourselves.
This is a country that is virtually in a state of civil war.
It is impossible for the government to guarantee control and surveillance â in fact these were never satisfactory, even during peace time.
What happens now is that the EU fleets can do what they like with no supervision whatsoever.
The Commission actually promised a different approach to third-country agreements and this does not bode well.
With respect to CÃŽte d'Ivoire, the Commission has itself noted that the country faces serious problems in the control and surveillance of its waters.
The state of monitoring is described as a major constraint.
The Commission also noted that no information was actually received on the catches of surface long-liners and freeze trawlers.
The Commission has also stated that, under the current terms of its third-country agreements, including the one with CÃŽte d'Ivoire, it is impossible to know whether the money intended for the so-called targeted actions such as control and enforcement is, in fact, spent in the appropriate manner.
We have said that this money should be placed in a separate budget.
When it comes to the tuna canneries, look at where the main profits are going: there is complete hypocrisy here.
This is a country in a state of conflict and it looks like the EU's approach is to allow our fleets to continue undisturbed, despite the fact that there is a conflict going on.
This is the worst example ever of a fisheries agreement, and the Commission has to live up to its commitments and its promise to take a different approach to fisheries agreements where that is in the interest of the third country rather than in the interest of the European Union's over-capacity.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I disagree with the claim that this is the worst fisheries agreement that we have.
The fact is, unfortunately, that there are many worse agreements than this one.
We are in the process of renewing and modernising these agreements, making them more relevant and increasing the focus on social development.
The old generation of these agreements, however, really deserves a black mark, and it is thus extremely important to change this situation.
This is happening on a country-by-country basis.
The current conflict in CÃŽte d'Ivoire is not a very good background for stopping this agreement.
We should be wary of politicising the matter by using the agreement to put pressure on the Government to achieve peace and reconciliation.
It is very difficult to pressurise the opposition in this way.
As regards surveillance and the management of maritime resources, this conflict has not really taken place at sea, so I find it rather artificial to link the problems in the country with the continuation of this agreement.
We are trying to do useful things in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, and at the same time we are putting pressure on all sides to arrive at a compromise.
If we start politicising this activity we will be sending the wrong signals to those involved.
I would thus urge Parliament to stop this.
Mrs McKenna made some very relevant points, however.
There is a process under way to increase the focus on development in these fisheries agreements.
Â Â  That concludes the debate.
The vote will be at 11.30 a.m. tomorrow.

Â Â  Mr President, since this is the season of good will, could you use the good offices of the presidency of Parliament to resolve a situation which has occurred in London?
I understand that the UK Independence Party, that august organisation, has locked out all the staff from the European Parliament office in London.
At this time of the year we do not want to see more people on the streets.
Could the President intervene to try and resolve the problem of those poor people stranded on the streets?
Â Â  Mr Miller, although my initial suspicion is that all this has nothing to do with the agenda, I can quite understand your desire to see it in the Minutes, so that is where it now is.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0451/2003) by Mrs Aaltonen on behalf of the Committee on Petitions on petition 842/2001 concerning the effects of discriminatory treatment afforded to persons with Multiple Sclerosis, within the European Union (2003/2173 (INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, on the last plenary day of the European Year of People with Disabilities, I am very grateful to be able to present to you, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, the report I have drawn up concerning the effects of discriminatory treatment afforded to persons with multiple sclerosis in the European Union.
The background to this report is a petition by a young English woman two years ago and I am happy to be able to say that Louise McVay is at this moment sitting in the visitorâs gallery, observing what her determination and courage led to.
Louise found out she had MS and was bitterly disappointed to learn that she simply had not been allowed to benefit from life enhancing medication.
