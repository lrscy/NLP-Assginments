On the other hand, Amendment No 2 seems to be slightly excessive, seeking, on the pretext that animals under 24 months do not pose exactly the same problems as other animals, to eliminate the systematic use of rapid screening tests and to allow other countries, particularly Great Britain - the country that initiated this and the most affected - not to carry out systematic screening.
If that is the intention behind the amendment, we in the Group of the Greens are totally opposed to it.
Since this debate is evolving continually, I will add that, as Mrs Doyle has just said, we are asking ourselves questions about Canada or the United States.
No country is today able to say that it is free from BSE or TSE and, more importantly, we should now have screening for sheep, since it is obvious today that the disease was definitely spread from them and that it is better to monitor this type of livestock, which can also pose the same problems that we have had with cattle.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, BSE is the biggest tragedy ever to hit European veterinary, an unparalleled tragedy which will claim an unknown number of victims.
BSE is a nightmare for the consumers who desperately question the safety of their food, and BSE has dealt cattle farming an enormous blow.
Today, we are discussing a package of measures which was announced back in 1997.
This is therefore the appropriate time to thank rapporteur Mrs Roth-Behrendt: her perseverance, her expertise in this field were essential, and without her thoroughness, the Union would not be where it is today.
Thanks to Parliament' s input at first reading, the common position is, on the whole, acceptable: systematic test programmes, which will also apply to sheep in due course; strict and clear rules with regard to specific risk material; effective inspections especially on imports; and market access legislation.
All of this is of crucial importance.
Today, we have to express our trust in the common position. This is the policy by means of which we can fight BSE.
The measures must also be able to count on the commitment in Brussels and in the Member States.
That is a deciding factor.
After the increase in the number of BSE cases in France, fresh measures have repeatedly been put in place in recent months, and it was remarkable in this respect that Commissioner Byrne himself stated that food safety as such does not require new measures, but that the measures were particularly necessary to restore consumer confidence.
With this statement, he was, in fact, vague once again.
Measures are needed and are no luxury. Let there be no mistake about this.
Food safety is a very emotional topic and as such, food politics is now partly about the management of emotions.
Statistically, we can say that food has never been so safe, but that does not convince anybody.
You cannot restore confidence just like that, not even by encouraging organic farming, or by discouraging large-scale, industrial production methods.
Confidence can be restored by means of a credible policy and clear language.
Safety, prevention, control and eradication of BSE now require political commitment.
The BSE crisis was much more than a very serious food problem; BSE ended up being a political crisis as well. It stands for passing the blame and dodging responsibility.
In this way, BSE became the cause of a complete overhaul of European food policy.
A European food authority is set up and we re-establish the principles of policy on foodstuffs.
But our discussion goes further than that, of course.
We must now take a good look at food production.
We want a green revolution, we want quality rather than quantity, our agricultural policy can no longer damage the environment, we must move away from protectionism which disadvantages third-world countries, and we must take animal welfare seriously.
And we should not wait six years to achieve this.
Today, we must express our commitment to the BSE policy, and that is, in my view, the go-ahead for a green revolution and for a policy that is based on quality.
Mr President, Commissioner, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have cooperated splendidly to make the prevention and control of encephalopathy in animals more effective.
The Regulation under discussion will help in the harmonisation of the legal basis.
The Regulation takes account of scientific development.
BSE tests for sheep and goats will be introduced as soon as the testing methods exist.
The rapporteur is proposing two amendments.
The first one deserves our strongest support, as it will provide even more protection, especially for those countries where there have been no cases of BSE as yet.
The transport of animals is the main reason for the spread of animal diseases, which is why inspection has to be effective.
Our group considers the second amendment to be unclear and for that reason does not support it, especially if the aim is to lower the age limit for BSE tests to animals which are 24 months old.
This is not necessarily a sensible solution for all Member States.
In saying this I certainly do not wish to oppose the proposal, if some Member States want to do this.
Measures in the EU must, however, adapt to the BSE situation prevailing in Member States in compliance with the general policy contained in this Regulation.
Mr President, although I am not from the same group as Mr Whitehead, I share his thoughts on Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and if she has to have an operation tomorrow we wish her a speedy recovery because in a way she is the driving force behind the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
In any event, she has only tabled two amendments, because the Commission accepted the majority of the amendments tabled at first reading.
These two amendments, as has already been said by other Members, concern the additional guarantees that some Member States can stipulate in order for animals to enter, and also with the possibility of conducting tests on animals of less than 30 months.
However, as I come from a small region with small farms that have huge problems, and where there have been some, but very few, cases of BSE, I would like to highlight three issues that I think are fundamental.
One of them features in Article 6 and refers to the need to train and educate staff working for the competent authorities, staff that work in laboratories, people who rear animals and those who sell them.
In practice, I have seen that all of these people are faced with a problem that they do not understand and that they do not know how to deal with.
This training programme is therefore essential, in my opinion, and should be implemented as soon as possible, because it would be a method of prevention.
With respect to the banning of feed containing animal proteins, as established in Article 9, my opinion is that this ban should now be total.
Cows should eat grass and this is the best way of preventing what is occurring now.
There should also be immediate 100% compensation for the animals slaughtered on these farms.
I have seen how some of the farmers in the region where I live, who had 25 or 30 cows, have very little money left on which to live.
If all the animals are slaughtered they are left without their livelihood.
It is therefore essential that the compensation that they have not yet received be paid out immediately.
I think, Mr President - and I will finish here because my time has run out - that if we wish to regain credibility among consumers, measures like these and others must be implemented immediately and clearly.
People need to see that measures are being taken in Europe, otherwise it will be impossible to regain that credibility.
Mr President, although the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has not treated the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, very gently this time, I would nonetheless like to thank her for the excellent work she has done at the various stages of the report.
The committee adopted the two amendments, the first of which was originally a joint proposal by Professor Trakatellis and myself.
Its content, in brief, states that Member States in category 1 maintain their right to demand additional guarantees on animals being brought into their territory.
It does not aim to prevent imports of or trade in animals between Member States, but just to stop diseases from spreading to those countries where they have not yet occurred.
It is naturally in the interests of the EU as a whole that diseases, including TSEs, are confined to as small an area as possible and prevented from spreading to new areas.
In our examination of individual rules on the prevention and control of TSE, it becomes ever more apparent that the whole common agricultural policy needs to be reformed, which is to say, certain steps need to be taken to amend it.
It would be worth seriously considering an arrangement whereby the CAP would set common targets and minimum requirements in such areas as environmental consumer protection and animal welfare, but in which the wisdom of common agricultural aid would be reconsidered.
Such a model would permit national aid to be granted mainly to promote food safety, environmental cleanliness and the aims of regional policies.
In my opinion this would be one possible way forward, and one that should be taken seriously, from the current system, which is bad for the taxpayer, the consumer and the environment, and particularly bad for the farmer.
When the EU was established, the goal of its agricultural policy, in its simplicity, was to guarantee a sufficient supply of food at a time of shortages in an economy just recovering from the war.
Article 33 of the Treaty is still based on this approach, even though the EU achieved self-sufficiency back in the 1960s and production has exceeded demand since the 1970s.
We now have to shift the emphasis from quantity to quality.
Tonight could signal the end of two years of hard negotiations between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the legal framework to combat transmissable spongiform encephalopathies.
This is the first major piece of legislation to be adopted following the introduction of co-decision in relation to veterinary matters impacting on public health set out in the Amsterdam Treaty.
It is both ironic and appropriate that it relates to BSE, as it was the BSE crisis which led to the introduction of co-decision in this area of community activity.
I would like to pay particular thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, the rapporteur, for her tireless work over the years in pursuing a coherent community approach to the control of TSEs.
A great many of the key provisions of the Regulation under discussion result directly, or indirectly, from her personal commitment to putting in place a very strong framework to protect our citizens from the threat from TSEs and this is an objective I fully share and I want to join with Mr Phillip Whitehead in wishing Mrs Roth-Behrendt the very best for her stay in hospital over the next couple of days.
When we started our work on this proposal in late 1998, the majority of Member States considered themselves free of BSE.
This was still the case in May 2000 when the initial opinion of Parliament, largely endorsed by the Commission, was adopted: The ensuing negotiations with Council remained blocked as Council could not agree on the proposed central role of a scientific assessment for the BSE classification of countries.
However, after the adoption of new emergency measures for the Community-wide removal of specified risk materials and the introduction of rapid tests for BSE, a compromise on the legal framework came within reach.
The provision for such a large-scale screening allowed Council to agree to classification by the Commission on the basis of the Scientific Steering Committee opinion provided it was verified by that screening.
At its first reading, Parliament proposed verification of the scientific risk assessment by statistically valid large-scale screening.
In its amended proposal, the Commission proposed large-scale screening as a transitional measure for the changeover from the current uniform SRM rules to the classification-based rules of the regulation.
These two elements allowed the Council to come to a political agreement on its common position in December 2000.
Apart from leading to the Council common position, the start of the large-scale screening at the end of 2000 had yet another effect: within days Germany detected BSE cases amongst healthy slaughter animals.
Around the same time, Spain and Italy detected their first cases and a number of BSE cases detected in France also rose steadily.
Consumer confidence dropped to a record low.
Faced with this crisis, the position of Council, Parliament and the Commission drew closer.
Aware of the urgency of the matter and the need for a proper legal framework, in particular in relation to BSE eradication and imports from third countries, an informal trialogue took place prior to the Council adopting its common position.
During this trialogue, a very solid basis for agreement between the three institutions emerged.
These were hard but very constructive negotiations proving that the three institutions can work together very constructively on key issues related to public health.
The Council agreed to additional demands from Parliament increasing the number of tested animals.
The Commission committed itself to introduce all new measures, adopted under safeguard procedures after the common position, into the regulation.
The Commission also committed itself to take without delay all necessary initiatives under comitology after entry into force of the regulation.
Consequently, the common position of Council was adopted by unanimity and endorsed by the Commission.
This compares with the very sharp differences in approach in the past on BSE-related issues.
I would finally like to remind Parliament of its resolution of 16 November 2000 on BSE and the ban on animal proteins in animal feed.
In this resolution, Parliament asked for several protection measures.
These included a temporary suspension of the use of meat and bone meal, increasing testing in all Member States and rules for the control of scrapie.
The TSE regulation, in its current form, provides the framework and, in many cases, the detailed rules for these measures.
Further amendments at second reading would, however, delay formal action upon this resolution.
I trust that this House agrees with me on the need for the proper legal basis to be operational without delay and from what some of the speakers have already said, there appears to be a measure of agreement on that issue.
The debates we have had in Parliament on this subject since last November make this only too evident.
It is vital, therefore, that this regulation enters into force as soon as possible.
The Commission is therefore prepared to consider only amendments which would substantially improve the text or correct important weaknesses.
Neither of the two proposed amendments falls, in my view, into these categories.
I cannot accept Amendment No 1 for reasons of substance also.
This amendment, which had already been rejected in committee during first reading, proposes the right for BSE-free Member States to take unilateral action at their own discretion against the import of any live animal.
This is against the principles of laying down Community rules.
It is also superfluous, as one of the main objectives of the regulation is to create harmonised rules for the marketing of animals in view of BSE status.
Nor can I accept Amendment No 2 as it makes the establishment of an epidemiological picture of all Member States more difficult.
This does not however prejudge future initiatives from the Commission on the basis of this regulation in the light of the experience gained particularly on the aid structure of the cases detected by the current screening, and this can be done by comitology.
Over 1.3 million tests were carried out on healthy animals aged over 30 months in the first three months of this year.
These are in addition to the tests on fallen animals and at-risk animals.
We are rapidly acquiring a hugely improved picture of the true incidence of BSE in the Community.
If I see any reason in the light of this evidence to reduce the current age of testing, I will not hesitate to take the necessary proposals.
I would also add, in this respect, that research continues on more sensitive tests than are currently available.
In conclusion, we are now very close to putting in place the proper legislative framework for the control of TSEs.
It has taken much time and effort, but the text of the common position following considerable input of all three institutions provides a coherent set of rules and procedures for the future.
May I just comment briefly on some of the contributions made by some Members a moment ago.
This particular proposal is compatible with the OIE international standards.
Furthermore, let me say that I greatly welcome the views expressed by Mrs Paulsen when she made reference to the proposals on animal feed and, in particular, the bi-product legislation.
Let me comment on Mrs Auroi's remarks on the testing of sheep: I should point out that I am bringing a proposal on random testing of sheep very shortly.
In the draft decision, we have foreseen as a first step 170 000 tests on sheep from October 2000 for the first year.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Movement of pets
The next item is the report (A5-0125/2001) by Mrs Jillian Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the animal-health requirements applicable to non-commercial movement of pet animals [COM(2000) 529 - C5-0477/2000 - 2000/0221(COD)].
Mr President, the purpose of this regulation is to ensure consistency by 2002 in the rules governing the non-commercial movement of pet animals, which has been commonly labelled the pet-passport scheme.
The fact that this proposal has been brought forward by the Commission represents a remarkable achievement in action taken to control rabies.
The success of the vaccination campaigns against rabies have led to a fall in the number of cases amongst cats and dogs from nearly 500 in 1991 to just 5 in 1998 and it is because of that success that we have seem the partial abolition of the six-month quarantine system in the United Kingdom and Sweden.
It is the problem of rabies, which has prevented consistent rules being adopted up until now, and so Member States have dealt with the movement of pet animals in very different ways, so I am sure that a uniform set of rules will be very welcome.

The Commission measures are based largely on the British scheme and they allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU and certain third countries on condition that they can be identified by electronic chip or tattoo, that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel.
The proposal also allows the free movement of insects, fish and some other animals.
It is very important that there is scope within this proposal for certain Member States to vary the provisions when special circumstances make that necessary.
The Commission proposed both Article 37 and 152(4)(b) as a double legal base.
However, as the regulation refers only to pet animals and to the adoption of veterinary measures to protect health, the Environment Committee agreed that the regulation should be based only on Article 152(4)(b) which relates to public health and which covers rabies.
The Committee on Legal Affairs agreed with this view as again the proposal concerns only the movement of pet animals and its aim is the protection of public health.
I hope that we can reach agreement on the legal base.
The key points of debate in committee were first the use of tattoos and electronic identification systems.
Tattoos can cause problems, they can become difficult to read or they can be altered.
In contrast, the use of electronic chips are more effective both in terms of identification, but they are also a much more humane method because the animal does not need a pain reliever or a tranquilliser.
Therefore, in the long-term we believe that microchips are preferable, but we have to take account of the fact that a number of Member States at the moment accept tattoos under their national legislation and so a transitional period of 8 years is proposed by the Committee for the phasing out of the tattoos.
Similarly, it is proposed that during this transition period the countries which do not accept tattoos as a valid form of identification at the moment can still require electronic microchips only.
Amendment No 8 refers to the need to state clearly in this proposal that puppies and kittens cannot moved until they have reached the age for vaccination and other requirements because there is misconception about this.
If this scheme is to be successful, it is crucial that it is operated effectively.
The use of specified ISO transponders would help achieve this.
Similarly, the capacity to record the name and address of the animal owner would assist in combating trafficking in pet animals, and clarification of the anti-rabies vaccine is included in the report as well as the OIE International Animal Health Code again for the purposes of effectiveness of the proposal.
Another issue that we discussed in committee is that of quarantine and the purpose of Amendment No 9 is to clarify that animals from third countries at risk of rabies which are brought into Sweden, Ireland or the UK, the so-called sensitive countries, via another Member State have to remain in that country for at least six months before travelling to those three countries.
This of course removes the need for quarantine, but it also provides the extra safeguards that those countries require.
A controversial issue has been that of ferrets and whether or not they should be included in this regulation.
The Commission proposal includes ferrets in the category of pets which would not require any specific animal health requirements.
There have been very different views on this, but the view of the Environment Committee is that this would pose an unacceptable risk and ferrets should therefore be removed from Annex I, Part b.
Finally, it is very important that detailed information is available for consumers and for staff at EU borders to ensure they are familiar with the requirements.
My aim in drafting the report has been to retain the positive and essential elements of the Commission's proposal whilst at the same time taking account of the requirements of certain Member States.
We heard a lot in the previous debate about confidence, and confidence in this scheme is essential for its successful operation and the amendments are designed to improve the Commission's texts to this end.
Mr President, the Regulation before us is aimed at coordinating and facilitating matters for those who wish to travel within Europe with their pets.
The matter may at first sight appear trivial, but we Swedes remember the Swedish ambassador to Portugal, who has now been retired for a good 20 years, who refused to leave his residence in Lisbon because his life companion, an old Angora cat, would be forced to remain in quarantine for a long period in order to be able to enter Sweden.
In the first place, these rules are intended to offer protection against rabies, a disease which, in popular belief, has fearful and deeply mystical associations.
It is not for nothing that, in Swedish, the disease is known by a word also meaning hydrophobia.
Ireland, Great Britain and Sweden have been free from rabies for quite a few years, and the proposal for a Regulation is therefore, in the first place, of significance for these countries, even though the incidence of rabies has declined throughout Europe.
We must, however, make sure that the rules are designed in such a way as to provide adequate protection against the spread of rabies to, in the first place, areas that are free of the disease.
In the wake of mad cow disease and foot-and-mouth disease, cases of rabies in, for example, Great Britain as a result of changed EU regulations would give rise to deep mistrust of the EU as an organisation.
In the course of dealing with this matter, the legal basis has been changed.
The change is explained in terms of the fact that the Regulation is aimed at protecting public health.
Nonetheless, animal diseases too, including those affecting pets, can be very aggressive and cause great suffering.
Examples include aggressive forms of distemper.
I should therefore like to ask Commissioner Byrne: do you believe that protective measures in accordance with other EU directives are enough to enable the Member States to take measures to combat infectious diseases that can cause great suffering among domestic animals?
For many years, it has been incomprehensible that the rules governing the commercial transport of animals have been less rigorous than for domestic animals of the same species.
The undersigned therefore submitted a proposal to the committee to the effect that the Commission should review existing legislation governing trade involving animals with a view to attempting to achieve harmonisation with the rules in this proposal for a Regulation.
This was also the committee' s decision, but I would alert the Bureau and the secretariat to the fact that the wording in the present proposal has been changed on this point.
Many are of the belief that puppies and kittens cannot be infected by rabies and can therefore cross the borders in Europe freely.
It is therefore important that the proposal for a Regulation should have been clarified in this respect, especially with a view to reducing the illicit trade in puppies and kittens not protected against rabies that clearly exists at the present time.
Apart from dogs and cats, ferrets are the only pets that can spread rabies.
There are now scientific proofs that vaccinating ferrets against rabies is effective.
According to the Swedish state Institute of Veterinary Medicine, ferrets ought in future to be vaccinated in the same way as dogs and cats.
In the reading in committee, all mention of ferrets was, however, removed from the list of measures to be taken.
Reference to ferrets ought, however, to be introduced into Annex 1, Part A, alongside reference to dogs and cats, and, if this is not approved, ferrets should continue to be referred to in Part B as per the Commission' s proposal.
Completely to omit ferrets is irresponsible.
We must remember that it is, in particular, children and young people who have ferrets as pets.
Finally, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Evans, for the sound work she has done on this matter.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Evans, not only on the work she has put in on this, but her very fair and lucid summation of the proposal as it left committee.
What we have here is that critical balance between public health requirements and common humanity.
Humanity forces us to consider the suffering of those who have to leave cherished pets behind when they travel throughout the European Union.
We call this the "Whisky and Soda" reform in Britain, not because it was conceived in some drunken evening in SANCO but because those are the names of Commissioner Patten's two dogs which for many years he had to leave behind in France when came back to England and he was the principal sufferer - certainly in terms of publicity - who has brought about perhaps a change of thinking in our part of the world.
I just want to mention three critical areas: first, the time scale; Mrs Evans has accepted now that we have a time scale for the changeover of 8 years, which seems to me to be effective given the life span of most pets in moving from tattoos with all their weaknesses to a proper system of microchips.
I do not personally think that in Amendment No 7 where there is a proposal that we have to have an absolutely universal system of ISO standard microchips, that you can expect all animals fitted with a chip to be of that universal variety in the early stages.
We have to be a little more lenient there.
Secondly, I am delighted that we have now effective proposals, which I am sure the Commissioner will accept for the quarantining of animals which come from third countries where rabies is endemic - the Indian subcontinent would be a case in point.
People do move about, their animals move about and we know from other considerations, which are now taking part in another debate on vaccination which is going on with the import and export of foodstuffs, how many things come into and out of the European Community, which are putting us at hazard.
We do not want that in this case and so it is very important that the quarantine provisions remain.
Finally, ferrets.
The Ferret Trust have been following me around over the last few days in a state of great excitement about the provisions on ferrets.
In the UK, for sure, there are still some doubt whether you can actually prove the vaccination of a ferret sufficiently to be certain that it could be vaccinated and then be safely transferred as a pet from one country to another.
The Ferret Trust told me, very temperately, that they thought the determination of whether ferrets should be included in the pet passport scheme should be deferred until further research had been carried out and they quote two US authorities, Dr Bruce Williams and Dr Zack Miller, as experts in that field.
I would happy to go along with that.
I have nothing against ferrets, but I would think that even a small risk that rabies may be spread by even such an exotic source as this needs us to give further pause for thought and consideration, rather than simply rushing ahead with a proposal about which at least one Member State still has serious reservations.
Mr President, we should recognise that this report is a celebration of the fact that the war against rabies is being won across Europe.
This is a disease which has filled people with fear and horror for many years and it is a delight to see the reality of the decline in statistics which shows that the disease is now being eradicated.
I am also pleased, as Mr Whitehead has indicated, that the suffering and grief felt both by pets and by pet owners when animals have had to be put into quarantine for lengthy periods of time is now being replaced by passports and tattoos, so this is good news.
On a technical point, I look forward to hearing the Commission's response on the amendments which have been moved about the legal basis for this directive.
I am also delighted that the basis for the European proposals are those which have already been applied in Britain.
As Mr Whitehead has said, I have learnt, like he, a great deal more about ferrets than I knew a month ago.
I am sure the Commission has too.
I am sure in fact that the Commissioner is a great ferret fancier: if he has not got a house already full of ferrets then I am sure that the many newspaper articles about the virtues of ferrets have encouraged him to fill his house with ferrets I have no doubt they will make charming and affectionate pets and I look forward to them taking their place alongside cats and dogs at the earliest opportunity.
The decision we made in committee, just a couple weeks ago, about whether ferrets should be included on the list and have passports or not, was one of the most difficult that I have ever made.
The reality is that ferrets seem to have caused no particular problems.
One French ferret apparently seems to have been the cause of all the concern about whether ferrets can cause rabies.
I am sorry about this, but I look forward to a situation where the blood test for rabies antibodies can be verified and approved by the Standing Veterinary Committee and the scope of the regulation can be extended to encompass ferrets at the earliest opportunity.
In the meantime, we have to accept that if we are to put the fight against rabies as our first priority, then ferrets should not be included on the list at the present time.
But I look forward to ferrets having the right to roam across Europe, but not just yet.
Mr President, I will start where my colleague finished.
I am not particularly exercised about ferrets one way or the other I have to confess, but I rather like the line Mr Whitehead took: we should look again and maybe ask some of the experts.
There are many of us who are not very up-to-date in terms of what can or cannot be done on ferrets in relation to immunity testing.
I would not like the job myself.
I must confess a conflict of interest at the start.
When I return from Brussels or wherever, be it a Thursday evening or Friday morning, the greatest welcome I get is from my collection of dogs - at least in terms of the noise they make and the length of time.
Yes, the rest of the family are delighted - a quick "Hi Mum", - a head goes up and you might get a hug and then back to the TV or whatever they were doing - but 20 minutes later the dogs are still running round in high excitement.
So I can really empathise with those who feel passionately about the need to be able to bring animals freely throughout Europe subject to the conditions being laid down today and I welcome the report here before us.
The Commission measures proposed to allow for the easier movement of cats and dogs within the EU, and a selection of other animals that are classified as pets as well.
However, the Environment Committee did give the ferrets a knock and that is where it stands subject to perhaps investigating what my colleague Mr Whitehead has said.
I welcome very much, as others have said, that we can celebrate the success of the anti-rabies vaccination campaign which has allowed us to get to the point we are at today and which allowed initially the UK, Ireland and Sweden to change their quarantine system, thereby giving us the template that the Commission now proposes to extend effectively throughout the EU.
We must be on guard though about bringing pet animals in from third countries, because any cases of rabies which are found in the EU at the moment come from third countries where rabies is still endemic.
Let us be very careful about border controls in relation to importing again this horrible disease particularly to countries that are now rabies-free.
As part of the measures proposed by the Commission, animals will have to be identified by electronic transponder or tattoo, and provide evidence that they have been vaccinated and that their immunity has been checked more than six months prior to travel.
I have problems with any continuation of the use of tattoos, and the Environment Committee is of the same view.
I also have problems with ad lib use of transponders rather than standardisation of the transponder and this view is also supported by the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe, the FVE.
They feel very strongly that only a standard microchip should be used.
Remember it is 8 years down the line.
We have plenty of time to sort this out and get things in order.
The report before us is based on a Scientific Veterinary Committee report written in September 1977. This was before the agreed ISO standards 11784 and 11785 came into being, and therefore, before there was true compatibility between products from different manufacturers.
Since the introduction of standards which can be specified in legislation, as done in the UK pet statute, all ISO standard readers can read all ISO standard microchips.
Initially, we also thought that microchip numbers could be changed.
It has never been demonstrated that this can be achieved and technical advice from engineers involved in microchip design and manufacture indicates that it will never be easy or even possible to achieve.
We must bear in mind that more modern advanced microchips are being designed with authentication programmes which will be even harder to change fraudulently.
However, the value of the benefit in changing a microchip identification number in a pet animal is unlikely to ever be so great as to warrant the effort and the cost involved.
Tattoos, however, are much less satisfactory.
They are difficult to read in small species such as the cat, they are difficult to read in breeds where the ears are cropped, they are difficult for regulatory officers to read in aggressive or apprehensive individuals and they are relatively easy to erase and to change fraudulently.
I will therefore be supporting very strongly Amendment Nos 6 and 7, even though the need to retrieve the name and address of the owner off the microchip is in some doubt, but I go for a standardisation of the chip, and only the chip not the tattoo.
Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Evans, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the animal health requirements applicable to non-commercial movements of pet animals.
This assembly is well aware of the importance of this issue which concerns all European citizens who are travelling either for holidays or for longer stays with their pets and do not want to leave them behind.
I do not mean that citizens cannot today travel with their pets, but the different regulations applicable in the Member States to movements inside the Community, as well as movements from third countries, are definitely difficult to understand and somewhat discouraging.
It is therefore time to establish a common set of rules applicable to the entire European Community, because this issue is directly linked to the free movement of European citizens when they own a pet.
The centre of gravity of this proposal is of course the rabies risk linked to movements of cats and dogs, the two major domestic carnivore species involved in the transmission of this fatal disease.
On this essential issue, the proposal is based on the recommendations of the International Zoo Sanitary Code, on reports of the Scientific Veterinary Committee and on the conclusions on panels of international experts consulted on the assessment of the rabies risk linked to movements of domestic carnivores.
I am most satisfied that the report supports the Commission's general approach on this fundamental question of public health.
There is unanimous agreement on the safety of the technical provisions relating to the management of the rabies risk, even if a few points of disagreement remain and may need some further clarification.
Allow me now to address in detail the amendments proposed in the report.
I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 12 and 13 relating to the legal base of the proposal.
The report concludes that Article 152(4)(b) of the Treaty is sufficient because the essential aim of the proposal is to protect public health.
This is indeed true at this stage, nevertheless the Commission considers that measures relating strictly to animal disease with no impact on public health could be necessary in the future, and a double legal base with Article 37 is therefore necessary.
I was asked by one Member earlier if we have we enough legal base or enough information to prevent other diseases in animals.
This is one of the reasons why Article 37 is included as a legal base.
I am aware from other proposals brought before Parliament that there is a general reluctance in Parliament and in the Environment Committee to support Article 37 as a legal base for provisions in conjunction with Article 152, probably because Article 37 is not a co-decision article.
But I would ask Parliament to reconsider its view in relation to this particular amendment and consider the question in the light of the need for animal health considerations being relevant, as one Member mentioned.
Hence the need for Article 37 rather than Article 152.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7 because it goes far beyond the scope of the proposal which is movement between Member States and from third countries.
This amendment provides an obligation for all Member States in relation to the generalisation of electronic identification of all cats and dogs and the establishment of a database to trace any stray or lost animal.
On the classification of third countries, the Commission proposal adopts the same conditions for imports from certain third countries whose rabies status is equivalent to that of the Member States as those which apply for internal movements.
Amendment No 10 suggests imposing on this category of third countries the criteria provided in the International Zoo Sanitary code for the recognition of a rabies-free country.
This is not consistent with the conditions applicable to internal movements.
A number of Member States are not rabies-free countries under this definition, even if rabies in domestic animals is under control on their territory.
This would be a discrimination which is not scientifically sound, and therefore Amendment No 10 is not acceptable.
Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 14.
This amendment would delete "ferret" from the list of species which may be moved inside the Community with no veterinary conditions.
The Commission proposal was based on a risk analysis which concluded that this species has no significance in the epidemiology of rabies in Europe.
I understand the special concerns with regard to this species because it is a carnivore and does bite, but the simple deletion from the list in Annex I, Part b is unfair to this species, as the only reason is that it belongs to the carnivore genus.
I should say to Mr Davies that I have discovered quite a lot more about ferrets than I knew yesterday and some of my meetings during the day today, including some of the exotic entertainments engaged some Member States, might account for some of interest that Mr Davies supports.
I would have been more open to the creation of a new category for ferrets with the requirement for vaccination, which is possible, but no post vaccination test can be foreseen.
The amendments submitted by the rapporteur and committee, but rejected, were heading in that direction and would have reached, in my opinion, a solution acceptable to everybody.
The Commission can accept six amendments: Amendment No 4 concerning the commitment for the future on a revision of the regulations applying to commercial trade species; Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 15 which bring clarification to the proposal and Amendment No 11 relating to a communication on this issue to the public by Member States.
It was with great interest that I discovered in Amendment No 6 a real pro-active position in favour of a generalisation, in the short term, of the electronic identification complying with ISO standard of animals moved between Member States or from third countries.
Therefore I can accept this amendment.
In summary, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13 and 14.
On the other hand, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 4, 8, 9, 11, 15 and 6.
To conclude, I wish to once again thank Mrs Evans for her excellent report and her support to this important proposal.
Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Veterinary medicinal products
The next item is the report (A5-0119/2001) by Mrs Doyle, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on availability of veterinary medicinal products [COM(2000) 806 - C5-0105/2001 - 2001/2054(COS)].
Mr President, I welcome the Commissioner to the House.
On welfare, therapeutic and economic grounds, it is essential that European veterinarians have access to the fullest possible range of veterinary medicines to treat all food-producing animals, while at the same time keeping consumer health protection at the top of all our agendas.
Requirements for the placing of veterinary medicinal products on the market have been harmonised since the early 1980s when Council Directive 81/851 was adopted.
A series of availability problem have arisen, compromising animals health and welfare across species. There is a need for urgent short-term solutions as well as for a broad review of all the legislation involved.
This is what the Commission proposes and I fully endorse it.
No veterinary medicinal product can be used in food-producing animals unless maximum residue limits, MRLs, are set up for its active substances.
A recent evaluation of the EU product licensing procedures observed, and I quote, "significant concern in the veterinary sector about the decreased availability of established medicinal products for food-producing animals as a result of the introduction of the MRL requirements."
The issue was brought to a head at the end of 1999 with the expiry of a transitional period for fixing MRLs for established drugs.
In many cases, the lack of adequate economic return has been an important factor in the failure of sponsoring companies to commit the necessary resources to generating the data necessary to satisfy EU regulatory requirements for fixing MRLs.
Many pharmaceutical companies have been spending up to 25% of the research budget in defending their products.
In its communications the Commission announces a number of short-term measures, the extrapolation of MRLs, and medium-term actions such as incentives for industry, more flexible rules for the use of products and the revision of the existing legal instruments.
They announced these measures to increase the availability of products.
These actions are to be welcomed and, in particular, the extrapolation of MRLs between species that could help to maintain on the market many products intended for minor species.
The MRL problem gives rise to greatest concern in these minor food-producing species, such as horses, goats, rabbits, fish, bees - minor in terms of their economic importance for the pharmaceutical companies, hence their lack of defence of the various veterinary products required.
But major species have also been affected.
In my own country, Ireland, there is no legal local anaesthetic to use on cattle at this point in time.
Every country can point to a major species where a drug has been taken off the market, not because it is not available somewhere in Europe, but because there has not been a marketing authorisation for that particular Member State.
Hence, the point I am making - and the Commission also shares this view - is that we need a pan-European system whereby a product authorised properly in one Member State can be used throughout the EU.
I would also encourage Member States to develop this system as quickly as possible, because it will be part of the short-term resolution of the crisis, and I use that word advisedly, that exists at the moment with the availability of veterinary medicines on the ground.
Many new Member States have been pressing the Commission for some time to deal with the availability problem, taking particular account of the unique situation of horses.
None of the other minor food-producing species I have mentioned exhibit similar features as the length of the life span, sections of the industry not being oriented towards food production, high monetary value of individual animals and the recreational and sentimental value.
A further complication is that three DGs are involved in all of this: ENTR, SANCO and indeed AGRI.
In December 1999, DG SANCO proposed to allow the veterinary use of substances without MRLs in horses, provided records of treatment are kept and horses do not enter into the food chain before six months after use.
Provisions relating to the equine passport were modified through Decision 2000/68 but it subsequently ran into legal problems.
Passports are now obligatory for all horses and contain a new annex for recording of veterinary treatments.
Directive 81/851 and Council Regulation No 2377/90 are however still to be amended to allow such use.
I am very aware of the concerns of the horse industry, particularly the thoroughbred industry, and I do not have to remind the Commissioner that if a full and up-to-date range of therapies is not available, there is a real risk that foreign investment in stud and training establishments throughout Europe will be lost to third countries.
Having said that, it cannot be ruled out that any horse could enter the food chain at the end of its useful life and therefore safeguards are necessary to cover this aspect, as I have already mentioned.
In conclusion, I would urge the Commission to ensure that as quickly as possible we have a short-term resolution to the crisis for minor food-producing species in relation to the availability of state-of-art veterinary medicines.
It is a welfare issue, it is a therapeutic issue, it is an economic issue, and it is in every Member State of the EU.
We urge the Commission to move as quickly as possible to amend the necessary regulation, to allow extrapolation, the use of passports for horses and to resolve the problem.
Like the rapporteur, I come from a country where we do not eat horses - people ride them but they do not eat them, the same as in the UK - and therefore I find it difficult to comprehend.
But I suppose there are other traditions in Europe, like eating foie gras, which is distasteful, because you also have to consider how the animal is reared, in humane conditions or not, how is the animal transported etc. With foie gras it is a much more cruel exercise and much more distasteful than eating horses because, at least in most cases, the horses have a better life than the unfortunate geese.
But it is clear that in some European countries horses are produced for human consumption - in the Benelux countries, France and Italy, there is quite a large consumption of horsemeat - and we have to take this into account.
As far as I can see, no distinction has been made, either by the Member States, or by the EU legislator, between horses raised for the purpose of meat production and horses raised for recreational purposes.
In relation to the access to medical and veterinary products for horses, we also have to take into account the whole issue of animal welfare problems.
When we look at horses that have been used for recreational purposes that end up going into the human food chain, it is essential that a precautionary approach is taken to ensure that public health and consumer protection take priority.
Even though horses are not initially reared for human consumption, they do end up in the human food chain.
It is extremely important we have viable and traceable means to ensure that farmers observe any preslaughter waiting-time periods, in particular concerning recreational horses entering the chain for human consumption.
It is an extremely important issue because although it will not affect people in Ireland and the UK - because we do not eat horses - it will in other countries.
It is important that there is a balance between animal welfare and the need for consumer protection.
On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank Mrs Doyle and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for this report.
There are many different perspectives to be reconciled.
Unfortunately, no satisfactory solution has yet been found.
The communication aimed to present the Commission's view on the problem of veterinary medicine availability and noted with satisfaction that the committee and the rapporteur share the general concerns of the Commission on this issue.
This communication clearly does not bring a direct solution; however, it outlines the options for further action in both the long and short term.
It is important to point out that the current veterinary and pharmaceutical legislation provides a framework designed to ensure, amongst other things, the optimal protection of consumer health.
This legislation is currently being reviewed.
This review will provide a timed framework to further address the availability problem for all animal species concerned in a global manner.
Any proposal for change to ease the access to the market of veterinary and pharmaceutical products, or to facilitate the use of certain medicines by veterinarians, will be in the interest of animal health and welfare.
However, it goes without saying that any of these proposals will have to be compatible with the objective of consumer health protection.
With this end in mind, I am cooperating with colleagues, Mr Byrne, in particular, and I expect the legislative proposal to be finalised within a few months.
This will allow an in-depth discussion with the European Parliament and the Council on all relevant matters.
Obviously, these legislative changes will take some time.
The Commission has therefore also announced its approval of the principle of extrapolating maximum residue limits established for some species to other species.
Such an exploration would only be possible under certain conditions.
While we recognise that extrapolating maximum residue limits cannot be a global solution, we believe that it can represent a practical improvement of the situation, particularly in the short term.
However, it also raises the complex technical issues, in particular the link with the possible illegal use of certain substances.
Thus, a need for appropriate analytical methods of control will have to be considered.
I am hoping that the further work in close cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will lead to a balanced solution, offering a framework for genuine benefit to animal health, while maintaining a high level of consumer protection.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, as you know, today is the eleventh World Press Freedom Day.
Many of our fellow Members would certainly wish to take this opportunity once again to state their solidarity with this struggle, a struggle, furthermore, which is proving successful, because, according to the Reporters sans FrontiÃšres association, fewer journalists are being imprisoned and fewer media outlets are being censured than a year ago.
Nevertheless, the list of sources of pressure and oppression against journalists is a long one.
Amongst the states which 'Reporters sans FrontiÃšres' accuses, such as Burma, Syria, China, Ethiopia, Tunisia and many others, we can now increasingly add various mafias, terrorist groups and fundamentalist movements.
Just in the last few days, we were saddened to learn that Brice Fleutiaux, the French reporter who had been held hostage for several months in Chechnya and on whose behalf we intervened, was unable to overcome the depression that affected him as a result of his incarceration, and took his own life.
I therefore believe that this Day must be an opportunity to give impetus to our collective commitment to this essential element of democracy.
That is indeed the case, Mr Wurtz.
We have certainly taken account of the statement you have just made.
I have taken the floor today to call on the Presidency to send a letter, or take any other measure it deems appropriate, with regard to what is happening to Afro-Colombian communities on the Pacific coast of Colombia at the moment.
Together with a group of other Members of Parliament, I wrote to Colombia in December, because these Afro-Colombian communities were being threatened.
The day before yesterday, seven members of these communities were murdered. I am in possession of the details of the names and ages of the victims.
However, the most serious aspect of this situation is that hundreds of other members of these communities are still being threatened.
We do not have the time to write to Mr Pastrana again.
I therefore believe that it falls to the Presidency of Parliament to raise awareness of this problem and ensure that these killings cease.
I appeal to you, Mr President, to arrange for letters to be sent from the Presidency to Mr Pastrana and to the European institutions to draw attention to the situation and to try to prevent even worse abuses.
Thank you very much Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez.
As you often play a leading role in defending human rights in America and elsewhere, I am sure you will understand that Parliament is always very concerned about problems of this nature.
I will pass the matter to the Presidency, so that it can approach the government of Colombia and efforts can be made to tackle and resolve this very serious matter.
Stability and convergence programmes
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0127/2001) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual assessment of the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes.
Mr Katiforis has the floor for seven minutes.
Mr President, the stability and convergence programmes being evaluated today by Parliament constitute the second updates of the original programmes first presented in 1999 by the 14 Member States, with the exception of Greece, which submitted its first programme this year.
Allow me to start with Greece' s programme, which addresses circumstances with which, as is to be expected, I am perfectly familiar.
The programmes form part of the control and discipline mechanism of the stability agreement, an agreement on budgetary prudence, the two main objectives of which are to ensure that the budgetary deficit does not exceed 3% each year and, secondly, to achieve a balance or surplus over the period of a full economic cycle.
If anyone had said back in 1993 that Greece would achieve these objectives in just 7 years, they would have been laughed at.
Greece' s middle name was inflation - 13% in 1993 - and deficit - over 14% of GDP in 1993.
It was the example to be eschewed in the European Union.
Few believed that it would be able to resolve these problems.
Yet, by the end of 2001, Greece - and the Council agrees with this - is expected, instead of a deficit, to have a surplus of half a percentage point of GDP, rising to 1.5% in 2002 and 2% in 2003.
Also, instead of 13%, inflation is expected to be a mere 2.3%.
I appreciate your allowing me to dwell on these figures a little because Greece' s espousal of the culture of price stability and budgetary stability was perhaps the jewel in the crown of this policy throughout Europe.
The spectacular turnround by this Member State, which succeeded in meeting the Maastricht criteria, is a typical example of the general climate of monetary and budgetary stability which has prevailed in Europe thanks to everyone' s efforts to support the single currency.
The motion put to the House by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs acknowledges and commends the achievement of budgetary discipline and price stability.
It points out that inflation was slightly above the ceiling set by the European Central Bank as the result of outside influences (oil prices, depreciation in the euro against the dollar), rather than internal economic weaknesses.
It also points out that a balanced budgetary position, and hence monetary stability, can only be achieved in the medium-term on the basis of a robust European economy centred on a high rate of growth in production.
The average rate of growth was 3.3% in 2000 with Austria at 3.5%, Finland at 5.2%, Greece at 4.1%, Ireland at an astounding 10.7%, Luxembourg at 8.3%, the Netherlands at 4.5%, Portugal at exactly the European average of 3.3%, Spain at 4% and Sweden at 3.9%.
Unfortunately, these rates of growth are unlikely to continue.
High oil prices, high interest rates and the slowdown in the American economy have caused initial forecasts to be revised downwards to between 2.4% and 2.8%.
So we cannot expect the same level of comfort or budgetary surpluses this year as we enjoyed in 2000, not that this means that there will be deficits.
The main thing is to be well organised and to use public money to support growth, especially if we bear the long-term targets set in Lisbon in mind: full employment within ten years, an increase in the working population to 70%, an average rate of economic growth of 3%, reform of the social state and a European economy at the forefront of the knowledge-based economy.
The stability programmes presented indicate that the Member States are aware of these needs.
They have used their surpluses to repay public debt, reduce taxes and increase public investment and, in the longer term, to stabilise the state pension system, which has also become an important consideration, with some resources being directed towards a reserve fund.
All these ways of exploiting strong fiscal positions are worthwhile and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supports them, but not to the same degree.
The Council considers the reduction of public debt as the main priority; it does not object to public investment, provided that it does not interfere with reducing debt, and it appears to oppose tax reductions.
We, on the contrary, consider the achievement and the manner of use of primary surpluses not as a matter of dogma but as a matter of political expediency, to be judged according to current conditions and the needs of economic management.
In the current situation, characterised by the menace of a serious recession in the US economy, as well as the persistent need to raise the rate of growth in Europe, debt repayment as well as tax reductions seem to us of lesser importance than financing public investment, naturally in balanced budgets, not deficits, both for supporting flagging growth and for pushing forward those structural changes necessary for the transition to a modern, technologically pioneering, full employment economy in Europe.
It should not be forgotten that the absorption of high rates of unemployment presupposes the consistent achievement of a 3% rate of growth, a target which cannot be said to have been met on a permanent basis in our economy.
Finally, I should like to address a request to the Commissioner, because the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is concerned about the Union' s continued failure to make available to the appropriate committee in Parliament the detailed technical evaluations of each programme and it reiterates its call for a more harmonised timetabling of submission of the programmes by the Member States in order to improve comparability, calling in this context for full and timely involvement of the European Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mr Katiforis for his report.
What exactly is this report about?
In May 1998, resolutions were passed making economic and monetary union a reality.
At the time, economic and monetary union and the introduction of a European currency were irreversible.
What were they based on back then?
First, the independence of the European Central Bank, in order to safeguard monetary stability and, secondly, the Stability and Growth Pact, the purpose of which was to ensure that the European currency cannot be jeopardised by the budgets.
Because our first objective in introducing the European currency - and this is particularly true of my Group - was a stable currency for Europe.
We now have before us Mr Katiforis' s report on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.
We must remember what this Stability and Growth Pact calls for.
It calls for balanced budgets and for countries which are still overly in debt to achieve a surplus.
At the time, when we were discussing the Stability and Growth Pact against the backdrop of the Maastricht Treaty, the important thing was not to exceed a new net debt level of 3%, which was the entry condition at the time.
Today, the important thing is to achieve a balanced budget or a surplus.
So what news on this front?
The first item of news is positive: in the euro zone, i.e. in the twelve countries which have introduced the currency, which we also refer to as the European home market, we have on average, I repeat on average, balanced budgets.
That is one very good point.
On the other hand, however, we must face the facts.
We achieved this objective in a period of growth which we shall be unable to match next year, namely with growth of 3.4%, i.e. in a fat year for the purposes of economic policy.
The Bible exhorts us to save in fat years for the lean years ahead.
Secondly, there were the UMTS licences, which gave our finance ministers a windfall.
Thirdly, we must bear in mind that we have age pyramids in store for us and that we need to make provision for the expenditure in store for us here.
I am firmly convinced that we have failed to grab this opportunity, we have failed to make proper use of this positive climate.
What especially worries me is that some countries still have a very high level of overall debt and that, in some cases, these debts are still somewhat short-term in structure.
We must face up to these risks.
Which is why we also need to call for the consolidation efforts which have started - and which are impressive in some countries but insufficient in others - to continue.
I have to say that my own country, Germany, gives me cause for concern, because our rate of growth is below the average in the euro zone.
Nor have we managed to balance the budget, despite the huge windfall from UMTS licences in Germany.
Now to my group' s stand on the Katiforis report.
We can support it, as it now stands.
However, we are concerned about two proposed amendments, both on the same subject, namely that investments should be excluded when calculating the Stability and Growth Pact margins.
We agree that investments are needed and that budgets should be restructured towards greater investment, but within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is why, unfortunately, we shall have to vote against the Katiforis report if these proposed amendments attract a majority in the House.
Mr President, my Group backs the rapporteur, who has clearly illustrated that the convergence and stability programmes are extremely valuable when it comes to forging real economic policy in the European Union in general and the euro zone in particular which is a matter of common interest.
We see the outlines of economic policy on the one hand, but we see the stability and convergence programmes on the other.
I should also like to remind the House in this context that the Stability and Growth Pact has predominantly been geared in the past towards achieving stability.
It did, however, always include growth factors.
From this point of view, the rapporteur' s approach is the right one, indicating as it does that it makes sense to use investments, both private and public, in order to achieve a real knowledge-based society of the future in the European Union.
If these public-sector investments are used for the benefit of information technologies, other new technologies and a better, modernised infrastructure in the euro zone and the European Union, then this is the right way forward.
From this point of view it is also very important that we restart the debate on the quality of public finances.
Luckily, the Commission has presented a paper here which will need to play an important part in future discussions in connection with stability and convergence programmes.
Because we must ensure when evaluating the state of public finances, which is also our job, when analysing the content of the convergence and stability programmes, that we identify the right trend, that we identify the right development, but that we do not lose sight during our discussions of the possibility of steering in the opposite direction.
Mr von Wogau, you referred to possible dangers.
You pointed out that advice in the Bible on lean and fat years should still be seen as relevant by financial policy-makers in the European Union.
Any analysis of public finances, however, must also consider what impact expenditure may have on monetary policy.
We therefore need to work with sound public finances in the euro zone because a poor financial situation could jeopardise monetary stability.
Windfalls have not been spent on consumption as in past years; they have also been used to reduce debt and for investments.
We must also consider how this sort of economic policy coordination can be used to guarantee social and employment policy as well as monetary stability.
Here too there is both an obligation and a challenge for the countries in the euro zone, the pre-ins and future candidate countries alike.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate provides us with an opportunity to consider the present state of the European economy.
Although this was generally encouraging in the year 2000, and we have enjoyed high growth rates, job creation and monetary stability, many hard questions have now to be asked concerning the development of these factors.
Consequently, considerable pressure will be exerted in some countries, as is already the case in the European Union as a whole, to move towards more expansionist policies.
Obviously, such a move could come into conflict with the commitments given within the stability pacts relating to Member States.
For this reason, we consider that certain parts of the report we are debating today are particularly apposite.
These are the sections highlighting the need to maintain budgetary discipline and to avoid undertaking to reduce taxes, a promise often given in the run-up to elections, unless corresponding balancing measures are adopted. We also endorse something Mr Katiforis is constantly stressing, namely that there should also be balancing measures for productive investments.
Investments of this sort will improve the productive structure of the European Union and make us much more competitive.
I would like to end by highlighting the need to maintain this coordination and the agreements established in the stability programmes. I also wish to point to the need to strengthen control of economic and monetary policy.
We believe this is still unduly fragmented. Obviously, the capabilities and coherence of the management will be put to the test when it is presented with greater problems in the future.
Mr President, as Mr Katiforis said introducing his admirable report, the facts before us reveal a state of affairs which nobody would have predicted a decade or so ago.
It is a matter of great satisfaction to everybody in Europe and in this House that this should be the caseso, although I dare say it is wise to be, as both he and Mr von Wogau are, only cautiously optimistic.
Pride often comes before a fall and we had better not be too proud too soon.
I agree very much with what Mr Katiforis said about the question of public investment.
The United Kingdom seems to have adopted an attitude of quite excessive horror about public investment, and I noticed that in yesterday' s Guardian newspaper Mr Bob Kiley, who ought to know, was predicting that the London Underground for which he is responsible, will, because of the Government' s insistance on the 'public-private investment partnership' whereby only private financiers are to come forward to invest, make the Tube worse and more expensive than it would have been under a programme of sensible public investment.
I only wish that Mr Katiforis' words would be attended to in my own country.
As has been said in the course of the debate, there is a matter of serious concern about the future pension liabilities of all the Member States.
I speak with a certain interest since my own next birthday will be my sixtieth and I would be very glad, therefore, if we were to carry Amendment No 4 recommending the creation of special funds to deal with the future overhang of pension liabilities as that is one of the troubles that may beset us.
But I welcome the report on behalf of my group and give Mr Katiforis our thanks and support.
Thank you very much Mr MacCormick. We would like to wish you a happy birthday in advance, and trust these problems will have been resolved by then.
Mr President, I did support Mr Katiforis' s efforts to give a bit of an impetus to our resolution on economic policy.
In the end, however, the report that we voted does not provide any real options and that is why my Group does not support it.
The Union' s economic policy stands out for its passivity and its dogmatism.
The Council, the Commission and the Central Bank are quite content and will not move an inch and the European Parliament has not managed to take up the challenge.
Our economic policy is demonstrating passivity in the face of a situation that is growing worse and in the face of the criteria that we would have to meet to ensure the sustainable development of the European Union.
The Central Bank tells us that, in the short-term, it should not intervene, since it is concerned with the medium-term.
With regard to the medium-term, however, it refers us to the structural reforms.
To put it plainly, monetary policy and budgetary policy must serve neither regulation of the present economic situation nor sustainable development.
This is clearly absurd.
What, however, do we say about it?
We do not manage to come up with anything significantly different, despite Mr Katiforis' s efforts for public and private investment, highlighting the current situation of under-investment.
In his explanatory statement and as he has repeated this morning, Mr Katiforis insists on the fact that public investment must take precedence over the concern to reduce public debt.
The position we have finally adopted, however, is dogmatic with regard to public finances and to the stability pact.
Mrs Randzio-Plath has spoken this morning, and not for the first time, on the quality of public finances and taxation.
I think that this is the way forward.
The reality of the situation, however, if you look at all of our resolutions and texts, is that they are all concerned with reducing taxation and with reducing public and social spending.
We are not succeeding in implementing this line of reform, which is intended to bring about a qualitative improvement.
Take, for example, our resolutions on reducing social security contributions coupled with wage moderation.
Our social and public spending contributes to keeping workers poor.
We are subsidising low-paid jobs and when it comes to expenditure, we know that massive public investment is needed and that public money is essential to make this investment, but we do not want to suffer the consequences.
It is the structural reforms that are given the most prominence, reforms that were conceived solely as a form of deregulation, as a sort of panacea, whereas in reality, the new problem, which is the new economy, is an organisation of the market designed to achieve sustainable development and social cohesion.
This requires a large contribution from public funds.
We talk about lifelong training, but we have no policy in place in this field and where aid for energy policy is concerned, we have made no progress at all. The same thing applies to transport policy and as for an industrial policy, we simply have none.
All of this would require a real increase in investment.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we wish to give economic policy its rightful place in Europe, I hope that, in addition to the first strategies that I mentioned just now, but which have not achieved success, we can prove that we are up to the task of making it a reality.
Mr President, I support economic cooperation within the European Union.
It is important if the internal market, and more particularly the single currency, is to operate effectively.
From an Irish perspective the stability programme is central to the budgetary process.
A most recently updated programme adopted last December was framed against a prospect of strong but moderate economic growth and in the medium to long-term the Government intends to continue to run significant budgetary surpluses reflecting economic good sense and our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.
Needless to say, I fully support the policies being pursued by our Minister for Finance.
We believe that government debt in Ireland will be reduced to around 25% of GDP by the year 2003.
We are allocating at least 1% of GDP annually to build up the pension reserve fund so as to provide for our ageing population.
In relation to price inflation, which is one of the issues addressed in the Council' s recommendation to Ireland, it is important that we are clear on the following key statistics: the latest figures show that inflation as measured by the harmonised European index has fallen from 6% last November to 3.9% this year.
Our inflation rate is now lower than that in a number of other EU Member States.
In conclusion, as regards the future of Ireland within the European Union, we are fully committed to the operation of the internal market and to the single currency.
We want to make both these key projects a real success within the Union, and we support enlargement.
I am actively canvassing for a yes-vote in the referendum which I hope will be carried.
Mr President, over the past year, we have seen a slight improvement in the budgetary situation.
That was, however, not due to the policy adopted but rather to incidents and unexpected strokes of luck, such as stronger economic growth and the auction of UMTS.
The favourable economic tide should have been used to bring about reforms.
There is not so much a need for new initiatives as there is for the implementation of politically-inspired objectives.
The areas which require attention are clear: reforms on the labour market, fiscal reforms, liberalisation of the utility sectors and greater incentives for entrepreneurship.
At 2.6% in March, inflation is still far too high. Interest rates cannot be lowered as a result.
Whether you like it or not, the ECB' s objective is price stability.
Moreover, the real interest level is low enough to offer an incentive for growth.
The risk of price increases upon the introduction of the euro is another reason for the European Central Bank to maintain interest at its current level.
Both growth, wrongly expected by some from the ECB, and a better functioning internal market, will need to be achieved in and by the Member States themselves.
The call for more coordination of the economic policy is then not the most effective approach.
The stability and convergence programmes are right to confine themselves to the monetary policy.
In short, the rapporteur' s call for an acceleration of the structural reforms receives my unqualified support.
Mr President, we have all seen the European indicators.
Economic growth in Europe is slowing down.
The reasons include rising oil prices and higher interest rates, which are already dampening company profits.
We now have a choice of several measures designed mainly to bring about higher rates of economic growth in Europe.
Under no circumstances, however, should we simply increase public investment.
We need more forwards on the European economy team.
There are too many defenders on the playing field and too many reserves who never even see the ball, which is why I think that, first and foremost, we need to improve the framework conditions for our working population.
Overly high tax rates must be reduced so that it pays to work in Europe.
National budgets must be reorganised mainly by reducing bureaucracy rather than adding to the burden on our people.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I start by pointing out once again that there is a connection between the 1 January 2002, when notes and coins will make the euro a tangible reality for all our citizens, the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact.
That we now have a stable euro for the whole of the euro zone is due both to the steady hand of the European Central Bank and the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact was the right pact.
For me, reducing debt means taking responsibility for the future.
For me, reducing debt and reducing the deficit each year mean a radical change of policy, because for years now we have sold the future down the river in our economic and budgetary policies, using the young generation in each country as packhorses, rather than lifting the burden from their shoulders and opening up future prospects through balanced budgets and surpluses.
The Stability and Growth Pact is therefore a question of responsibility for the future.
On the other hand - if we are to be perfectly honest - it is a really successful binding framework to guard against covetousness and opportunism in day-to-day politics.
It is also an important framework to guard against political misconduct in day-to-day politics and it is also an important framework for a proactive financial, budgetary and economic policy debate in our Member States.
Since the euro, since the Stability and Growth Pact, budgetary policy is talked about far more openly, the deficit is talked about far more openly, the connection between budgetary, financial, economic and structural policy is talked about far more openly and the necessary reforms are being implemented proactively in order to achieve a different objective.
One group is not being played off against another, which is why I am delighted - and I trust that I shall not be misunderstood now that several growth figures are back for discussion because they are being revised - that we are also debating the Stability and Growth Pact and the convergence criteria in the Chamber at the moment, because it shows our people and the public - including politicians - that changes to growth figures do not mean change to the stability and convergence criteria.
The Stability and Growth Pact is not a day-to-day short-term political football and it cannot be changed as and when it becomes difficult to implement and take the next step.
Nor is there any place for lassitude in making adjustments.
I should like to call on everyone to put an end to the lassitude which has set in.
More structural reforms are urgently needed because we need to move from one-off effects to sustainability.
We need to reduce taxes, but not at the expense of the Stability and Growth Pact. We also need to ensure that lip service - and this comment is addressed to the Council - to more radical reforms in pensions and extending the three pillar model at European level is at last followed by deeds so that we can continue on this path to success.
Mr President, I want first of all to welcome Giorgos Katiforis' s report.
It is regrettable that some aspects were deleted in committee and perhaps all those may be restored in today' s vote.
I would particularly welcome the proposal for a special pension fund by Member States.
It is an issue which has been addressed in Ireland over some years and has now been put in place.
Substantial amounts of money are now in a fund which will guarantee pensions long into the future, and this is a very positive development.
I make that positive point because I am going to be quite critical of the Irish Government' s position in relation to the broad economic policy guidelines.
For the first time ever an EU state was criticised unanimously, indeed reprimanded, by Ecofin.
This was unfortunate, not because it was not necessary, but because we should not the EU find ourselves in such a position that simply feeds euro-scepticism in Europe, particularly in the country which is so reprimanded.
Now the Commission has published its guidelines for 2002, all Member States, including Ireland, should openly negotiate its position, make it clear to the public at home what their position is, so that when the time comes and budgets are being implemented based around those guidelines, the public knows exactly why that is being done.
Mr President, Commissioner, the action taken by the Commission and Ecofin against Ireland was hasty and excessive.
It has damaged the EU and EMU - not just in Ireland, as has been pointed out previously.
It has put additional wind into the sails of the opponents of EMU in the countries outside the euro zone.
'That is how much the national freedom to determine one' s own financial and tax policy is worth,' the opponents of EMU in my homeland cheerfully chuckle.
You will no doubt soon hear Herman Schmid express something similar.
There is an alarming tendency towards complete centralisation within the Euroland countries.
The relative weakness of the euro against the dollar seems to have triggered a number of excessive reactions.
Obviously, there is a common monetary policy, but financial, budgetary and tax policy must not and cannot be managed in detail from Brussels.
EMU is an instrument for increasing the economic strength of Europe and therefore a certain amount of acceptance is required of the fact that all euro zone countries do not move at exactly the same rate simultaneously.
The next time that we get a case like Ireland' s, I hope, Commissioner, that the Commission will think carefully first.
EMU must not become a straightjacket for Europe.
Mr President, Mr Schmidt is absolutely right.
I do indeed intend to point out that now that the economic climate is changing - for undoubtedly the American trends will also have an impact in Europe - then naturally a corresponding change in economic policy is required.
I thus agree with the many speakers, headed by the rapporteur Mr Katiforis, who have shed light on the need for public investment in education, research, environmental improvements and the like.
It seems as if, as Mr Herzog also pointed out, there is a dogmatic opposition to such change.
Despite the fact that the economic reality is changing, policy has to remain fixed.
In this situation, it is important for individual countries to be able to act more freely, and here I understand Olle Schmidt' s concerns.
I am in fact very glad that my own Member State, Sweden, has not signed up to EMU and thus has a freedom to act which means that the country can conduct a more realistic economic policy with regard to the changes in economic trends.
Mr President, there has been a marked slowdown in the rate of growth in the EU economy.
The Commission and the IMF have revised growth forecasts from above 3% to 2.8%.
The rate of inflation is 0.3 of a percentage point above the 2% ceiling.
We all know why this is. Exploding oil prices, agricultural problems, the depreciation in the euro.
Our export-orientated Member States in particular have been hit by the hard landing in the US economy.
The own initiative report by Mr Katiforis, which has been clarified as the result of numerous amendments proposed by the PPE-DE Group, underlines the importance of controls on stability and convergence programmes to economic collaboration in Europe.
There is absolutely no cause for the passivity which Mr Herzog referred to.
Reducing government debt must continue to be our top priority.
We also need, however, targeted investments in information networks, technology and research and development.
This will bring us closer to the very ambitious objective set in Lisbon of making Europe the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy.
Most importantly, we must redirect our efforts towards education and training.
For me, lifelong learning is far too often a set phrase and far too seldom a requirement, conspicuous by its absence from curricula and syllabuses.
Mr von Wogau and Mr Karas have already spoken about the stability of the euro and agreed how important the steady hand of the ECB - and Wim Duisenberg - was; the euro has remained stable, all the political demands of the various camps notwithstanding.
What I am interested in is structural stability.
Our Member States should make use, in their economic and social policy, of benchmarking procedures and exchanges of best practices.
However, it is the opposite of this - namely poor practices - which my country is currently delivering.
Germany is bringing up the rear when it comes to growth in the euro zone at under 2.2%.
Chancellor SchrÃ¶der' s days of talking it up and laughing it off are finally at an end!
Faced with a lack of success with employment, one reason being that the programmes are not effective enough, he is trying to deflect attention from his own mistakes by slagging off the unemployed in general as good-for-nothings.
Anyone who tries to lump social spongers and shirkers - and they undoubtedly exist - together with the hundreds of thousands who have been desperately looking for work for years is making criminals out of victims and that is totally irresponsible.
This example shows that, with better data networking, we know full well where the shortcomings lie in each Member State.
They can no longer be swept under the carpet, they are in the spotlight of European public opinion.
No country in the EU will get on without budgetary discipline, without permanently reducing debts or without substantial structural reforms and the aims - competitiveness and stability - are well worth it.
Mr President, the European Institutions have made budgetary balance a priority, but this phrase, like all the calls for budgetary prudence, serves to conceal the fact that what we are reducing is budgetary expenditure intended for public services and social protection.
At the same time, we are not using any of the expenditure for helping large employers in various ways.
If the Member States, as well as the European institutions, stopped giving such huge amounts to large employers, the resultant savings would enable public services to be developed and would, at the same time, reduce unemployment through the consequent taking on of staff in public hospitals, transport and public education systems, whilst maintaining a surplus budget.
Clearly, however, there is no likelihood of this happening, because the European institutions and the Member States exist to serve the large employers and not the majority of the population.
Many items in the report attest to this.
When, for example, it dares to express satisfaction with the fact that unemployment has fallen from 9.6% to 8%, this represents around 15 million men and women forced into poverty in a region which happens to be one of the wealthiest in the world.
By the same token, the report gives its approval to anything that increases flexibility and competitiveness, especially of labour.
It quite clearly acts as the spokesperson for interests of employers alone rather than for the whole of the working population.
We shall, of course, be voting against this report.
The British Conservatives, like other centre-right parties across the European Union, are committed to properly-funded and high-quality public services and, if elected in June, to a massive increase in public spending of around GBP 62 billion on essential services like schools and hospitals.
We therefore welcome paragraph 6 but we have reservations about the rest of the report, in particular paragraph 4, because we cannot agree that the 'golden rule' is a good example for Europe to follow.
It is merely one of the many ways in which Gordon Brown succeeds in fiddling the figures.
This report and the Stability and Growth Pact in the convergent programmes are clear evidence of the link between tax-and-spend policies and monetary policy.
The pact applies to all EU Member States but the legal penalties are only applicable to those states in the euro zone: that is at the heart of our reservations about this report.
One of the reasons why we oppose the United Kingdom joining the euro zone is because we wish to keep the power to set taxes, budgets and spending decisions in the hands of democratically-elected national politicians.
Within the euro zone it is not surprising that constraints have been imposed on public spending decisions because if you have, to all intents and purposes, a joint bank account you are affected by the spending decisions of others and you can expect to want some control over those spending decisions.
The recent example of Ireland is a salutary reminder that by joining the euro a country takes on more than a single interest rate: its tax-and-spend decisions will no longer be decided solely in national capitals.
It is a prospect which most people in the United Kingdom view with disquiet, the prospect of following a budget by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ecofin, the Commission or the ECB informing that Chancellor that he or she is not permitted to increase spending on schools and hospitals and those services which are of such huge value to the people of the United Kingdom.
This has already happened in Ireland and it could happen in the United Kingdom.
But I would urge that the real route to economic prosperity in Europe is, as Mr Karas eloquently stated, structural and economic reform which will lead to sustainable prosperity, an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.
Mr President, I would first like to express my satisfaction with the report, initiated by Parliament, on the stability and convergence programmes prepared by Mr Katiforis.
In March the Ecofin Council completed its assessment of the third round of programmes we presented.
Increased monitoring of budgetary policies, following implementation of the stability and growth pact, is having very positive and beneficial results.
I am not sure whether, as Mr Karas stated, this is a means of establishing political stability, or simply a way of maintaining a clear commitment as regards public deficits.
The Member States have improved budgetary consolidation though close cooperation.
The latest figures show that ten of the current Member States anticipate that their public accounts will balance or show a surplus.
All, apart from the United Kingdom, will have balanced their budgets by 2004.
Public debt is decreasing significantly, and this year we expect it to fall below 60% in eleven of the fifteen Member States.
I therefore believe we have made significant progress and, as Mr Katiforis said, I think we have achieved economic stability in Europe in budgetary terms.
It is true that, although the task of restructuring public finances has enabled us to make significant progress, it poses a number of problems relating to long-term sustainability and the standard of public finances.
Basically, the Commission insists that progress must be made on both counts.
We must continue to strive to reduce the present deficits and to balance public budgets at the earliest opportunity.
There are still a number of cases of excessively high debts.
These must be reduced, above all in order to tackle future budgetary problems.
In this regard, I would like to highlight aspects of the matter pointed out by a number of speakers. I refer amongst others to Mrs Randzio-Plath, who mentioned the need to improve the standard of public finances.
Others spoke along the same lines. When we speak of the standard of public finances, we are referring not only to problems in the short-term, but also to those in the medium- and long-term.
In the short-term, these obviously relate to the fiscal reforms which will improve the administration of taxes. In the medium-term they concern all matters related to improved public expenditure.
I will refer to public investment, as set out by Mr Katiforis in his report, in a moment. Of course, there is the long-term problem of our ageing population, which should obviously be one of our main concerns at present.
The medium-term strategies defined by the Member States in their programmes clearly indicate their priorities. This enables us to reconcile the different views so as to improve coordination of our budgetary policies.
However, I would like to refer in detail to some of the problems raised by Mr Katiforis in his report.
I wish to make some specific comments on the very important subject of public investment, to which Mr Katiforis dedicates a substantial part of his report.
Firstly, I agree absolutely with him that, during the period of budgetary consolidation in the 1990s, many Member States reduced public investment, sometimes inappropriately.
Secondly, it is true that the improvement in the situation should allow priority to be given to public investment.
We would then be in line with the undertakings given in Lisbon. Their underlying aim is to improve our potential for growth.
My third point is that public investment is not incompatible with private investment.
Different types of investment can work alongside each other and can be interlinked. There is also scope for innovative financing methods.
Often, there is no reason why the public sector should act in isolation as has traditionally been the case.
In giving greater priority to public investment, which I fully support, we must not however forget the other side of the coin: greater public investment does not necessarily mean increased deficit. We believe that the problem should be resolved by redirecting certain types of expenditure and keeping public deficit under control.
In our opinion it is crucial for the public deficit to be controlled through budgetary discipline.
It is essential to balance the books in the medium-term.
It is true that measures such as the golden rule implemented in the United Kingdom are useful insofar as public investment can logically be financed thorough debt or deficit. However, such debt or deficit must not exceed the agreed limits.
Certain categories of spending should therefore have priority.
Hence, encouraging public investment does not equate either with uncontrolled debt or with a significant increase in public expenditure.
However, the Commission would obviously not endorse an increase in investment which could exceed deficit levels or current predicted expenditure levels.
Paragraph 10 of the motion for a resolution refers to improved harmonisation of the timetable for presentation of Member States' programmes.
We agree on this and have always felt it necessary to update programmes before budgetary procedures. We have stressed this point and will continue to do so.
We trust that in the future we will at least be able to ensure that the programmes in question will be updated at the same time as budgetary procedures are initiated.
Mr Katiforis also refers to the need to have the Commission' s documents available.
That is a long-standing debate.
We in the Commission do believe it is important for Parliament to have access to as much information as possible. Nonetheless, we also feel that the nuances or minor differences between the Commission' s proposal and the Council' s final decision are irrelevant as far as public opinion is concerned.
We think the debate should focus mainly on those features eventually adopted by the Council. For that reason we feel that making earlier documents available would complicate rather than simplify the process.
I will now turn to Paragraph 9, which deals with the Commission' s macroeconomic forecasts.
As you are aware, these are prepared independently of the programme assessments. They are drawn up twice a year and published when they are ready.
We have just brought out the latest ones, for the spring. They were forwarded to Parliament on 25 April.
They point to a number of interesting developments which have also been mentioned today. Our position on the Irish matter is well known.
Quite simply, all that happened in Ireland was that current regulations were applied.
Another development worth mentioning is the reduction in growth as a result of the situation in the United States. I note that some of you, ladies and gentlemen, have floated the idea of a change in budgetary policy as a positive contribution to improving growth.
As we see it, given the 2.8% predicted growth taken into account in the Commission' s forecasts, there is still plenty of scope for progress through the existing stability programmes.
The Commission therefore continues to emphasise the need for the successful completion of these stability programmes. This does not mean, however, we do not believe that automatic stabilisers might prove helpful in a context of lower economic growth.
These were the issues I wanted to bring to your attention.
It only remains for me to thank Mr Katiforis for his work and to express my appreciation to all of you for your contributions, criticisms and suggestions.
Thank you again.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
The debate is closed.
Internet II
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0116/2001) by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Next Generation Internet and the need for an EU research initiative.
Mr Harbour, the rapporteur, has the floor for seven minutes.
It gives me great pleasure to present this report to the House on behalf of the Industry Committee.
This is an own-initiative report by the Industry Committee and therefore it is a privilege to work on what are a relatively select number of these reports and to be the custodian on behalf of my committee.
I would like to take the opportunity to thank all the colleagues who have contributed to this report and those who helped me in industry and in the Commission to make sure that we covered the ground thoroughly.
I was pleased that the final report reflected all those contributions and was adopted unanimously by the committee.
I hope that it will get the same level of support from the House today.
This report sends a strong political signal to the Commission and Council that this Parliament wants this crucial area - the evolution of the Next Generation of Internet and electronic communication - to be reflected in the crucial decisions on research support that are about to made in the context of the Framework Six Programme.
I know that a number of colleagues who will contribute here today are also actively involved in this programme.
I would like to address the three key questions that I tried to answer in my report: Why is this so important?
Why do we use the word initiative in presenting this to you?
What do we want to look at and how are we going to achieve it?
First I think the strategic importance of electronic communications and the Internet are increasingly well understood by everyone in this House.
But what is the contribution for Commission and publicly-funded research?
This report argues that there is a strong case for supporting pre-competitive work in the next stages of the evolution of this technology and that pre-competitive work will underlie the future competitiveness of all the industries and service providers who are engaged in this crucial business, and governments as well.
With the adoption of the GSM standard in mobile telecommunications, we have seen how important pre-competitive work is in setting in place the standards, protocols, and architecture for the next and evolving stage of communications.
It is clear why we should do it but what do we need to do in that context?
We need to anticipate the technologies that will be needed in a world where the capacity of the whole distribution system for electronic communications is going to be far larger than it is today.
That investment is going in now and will continue to go in, so we should plan for a world with a very large amount of bandwidth capacity: that is the jargon we would use for saying the carrying-capacity of the wires or the airwaves that are communicating users to users and users with service suppliers.
The architecture that we should develop will be very different from the architecture we have today where carrying-capacity is constrained.
One of the core areas proposed in this report is to ensure that we use the research network that the Commission is already funding - the GÃ©ant network - to use that effectively by supporting projects that will exploit that very high carrying-capacity research network in anticipation of the whole infrastructure evolution that in future will be driven by the market place.
That is the core of the system architecture, but alongside that there are other public policy areas where we want to do research.
Issues of security and data protection are clearly important.
They are becoming more and more important as our personal data are so easily and quickly circulated.
It is also becoming more important because, in the wireless connected world, we will increasingly have more devices feeding information about ourselves, houses and cars into the system.
There will be a new type of personal data that is being used in a benign way to monitor the operation of our car and the security systems in our house, but if somebody could accumulate and collect that data it would be a far from benign use of it.
Data protection therefore needs to be thought of differently, encapsulating data together so it cannot be amalgamated in an unauthorised way.
We need to think about the new opportunities afforded by wireless technologies, how the amount of information carried in our personal devices or mobile phones can be used in commercial transactions, but also about carrying our health records around with us in case of emergency and about areas where highly confidential data will be distributed.
We also need to think about the new products that will allow wireless technology to carry things like video broadcasts, access to streamed broadcasts that could be passing through and around us: how, for example, could we access our local television station wherever we are in the world, and how would we pay for that?
That technology is something that will give us a real competitive advantage.
I have just sketched out the 'what' areas of my three questions, so let me conclude by saying 'how' we would like to move this forward.
This is a contribution to the debate on research policy in Framework Six Programme and our vote today will enable that to move at exactly the right time into the ongoing strategic discussion process.
We need to ask the Commission, in taking this forward, to look at building a network of excellence around these technologies.
Although this is one of the areas contained in the Commission's plans, it is clearly a priority for this particular field of technology.
We are also looking for the sort of integrated projects involving the public and private sector that the Commission envisages in its proposal.
In conclusion, I warmly commend this report to the House today and I would just emphasise again the importance that Parliament attaches to ensuring that the Commission takes this forward in its future strategies.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Harbour for his excellent report.
I am not just flattering him, I really mean it.
My congratulations on his report which contains both a comprehensive evaluation of the Commission initiatives and many of his own suggestions.
I should also like to thank him for his open-minded attitude to our positions, suggestions and proposed amendments.
Similar thanks go to the Commission, which really has proven over recent years that it is able to start its own European initiatives in an extremely important sector and implement them internationally.
We have to deal here with opponents - perhaps I should say partners at international level rather than opponents - who are very very strong in this sector, especially the United States.
It is becoming more and more important for us to come up with our own ideas on what future prospects we want to give the Internet sector as a whole.
So heartfelt thanks to the Commission - and the Council - on their innovation-friendly approach to this sector.
I should like to pick up on a few points addressed by Malcolm Harbour.
This initiative is concerned primarily with what should happen in the area of future research on the Internet.
I think it is important here to progress beyond the Commission' s previous initiatives and anticipate the future.
Malcolm Harbour mentioned this.
What does that mean, anticipating the future in the Internet sector?
It is tough terrain because forecasts are hard to make in both this and many other sectors.
Here, however, we are dealing with a sector which is moving very very fast, which is regulated but where it is increasingly important that we look ahead and decide what standards will be needed in the future.
The other question which keeps cropping up is exactly how this sector is perceived and understood by the people, by consumers as a whole.
It is becoming more and more important here to create real confidence, so that we do not just have the technology, which is fantastic, we do not just have clever and intelligent regulation, we do not just have standards which anticipate the future, we also have people and consumers who are ready and willing to invest in this sector, not just by making telephone calls, but by using it in future to conduct their transactions.
We shall need to invest much much more in this sector than we have done in the past.
If we are to create real confidence, I should like to call on the Commission to do more here.
To close, my request, my plea to the Commission is this: please bundle all the initiatives which you have started in the Internet sector into a single, cross-sectoral initiative with a real, overall, conclusive concept.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Erika Mann' s last words really struck a chord with me.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy which culminated in this own initiative report.
Mr President, there is too little investment in ICT across the entire European Union, both by industry and by the government.
Take, for example, the sixth Framework Programme: EUR 3.6 billion has been earmarked for ICT, but that is far too little.
For let us consider what is needed to turn Europe into the world' s most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, as was agreed in Lisbon.
First of all, we need a good infrastructure, of course, and I am taking a wide-angled view on this.
Based on my liberal belief, this does not, of course, primarily require government involvement.
At European level, however, there is naturally a need for a high-speed, trans-European research network, and that is where the European Union comes in a big way, as my fellow MEP pointed out a moment ago.
I would urge the Commissioner to show more ambition in this area.
There is also a need for good quality content.
Once again, the lack of capital is a huge barrier, especially to innovation.
The content sector consists of fledgling companies and medium-sized companies that wish to export, and due to the turbulence on the market, there is little willingness to provide risk capital.
Moreover, Europe displays strong regional differences in the supply of capital.
This situation puts Europe at a disadvantage compared to the United States, where three to four times more risk capital is being invested in digital content and in Internet-related activities.
That now leads to innovation, more economic growth and, obviously, to employment.
The public sector should play a more significant role in improving the situation by combining supply and demand in the European Union.
Finally, Mr President, for the first time in history, technology is driving constitutional law.
That is why I am asking the Commissioner why the topic "citizens and governance in the European knowledge-based society" , for which EUR 225 million has been earmarked in the sixth Framework Programme, does not fall within the same category as "technologies in the information society" .
Mr President, the government itself will also need to adjust to the information society.
Mr President, I welcome the report insofar as I think it is important to keep developing new technologies.
I think it is important, above all, to give as many people as possible the means to communicate freely with whomever they wish, as and how they please.
People must be allowed to choose for themselves in matters of information.
This alone brings us up against the main obstacle to this free network, to free communication.
There has already been a great deal of talk here about consumer confidence.
However, I think that this expression alone is most telling.
Consumer confidence means simply wanting to create confidence so that consumers believe that communications are secure.
Privacy is a different concept; it means that communications really are secure, which is why I should like to stress again that privacy should be the real objective, i.e. really guaranteeing that communications are secure.
There is one obstacle: monitoring is being driven further and further forward, including at European level.
It is often argued that there are now new Internet crimes or old crimes which are now being committed over the Internet.
However, the measures being taken in response are based on the belief that these crimes can be contained using state monitoring methods - as if.
At the same time, most measures are only able to frighten off the really stupid offenders.
They will not do much more than that because most of those who commit crimes in cyberspace also know how to protect themselves against monitoring.
The question of data protection is addressed in Articles 10 and 13 of the report.
However, it is partly restricted by calling for protection for data with financial or health implications alone.
I think privacy is important for all data.
Everyone has the right to choose for themselves in matters of information, which is why our slogan should be: down with monitoring, up with privacy.
Mr President, I fully support legislation to upgrade the quality and standard of telecommunication infrastructures within the European Union.
The changing nature of work today entails a knowledge of, and access to, new modern telecommunication facilities.
However, any changes to our telecommunication infrastructures must be fair and balanced.
It is imperative that new entrants to the marketplace are not permitted to cherrypick the larger and more lucrative urban areas for the use of these important new technologies.
There must be a strong commitment by all governments to ensure that equivalent telecommunications are provided in both urban and particularly rural areas.
This commitment to universal access for urban and rural areas must be intrinsically included in policies pursued by various telecom regulators operating in the marketplace.
New technology can contribute enormously to the implementation of effective rural development policy, and it will be a key factor in the creation of vital new employment in rural areas and in addressing the problem of the urban/rural imbalance which is a priority issue for this Parliament.
I welcome in particular the work of European Commissioner for Consumer Protection, David Byrne, in devising new mechanisms to govern consumer protection rights for people who enter into contracts over the Internet.
Electronic business is now one of the more significant drivers of both successful business development and national economic development.
It provides a fundamental new way of conducting commercial transactions and has far-reaching economic and social implications.
Mr President, the new Internet generation is making many interactive applications possible.
It should not be technology, but the user' s need that plays a key role in this.
The Harbour report, however, is very technology-led.
The public task consists of more than providing infrastructure.
The rapporteur failed to mention that the government also has the task of finding out how the new Internet can benefit the public.
First of all, technology can contribute to greater social cohesion, for example due to the fact that the replacement of standard activities leaves more time for human contact.
As this will not happen of its own accord, we need to look into the applications that could strengthen social cohesion.
Secondly, legislation on safety and content is insufficiently highlighted.
Safe infrastructure is important, but technology often does not rule out incorrect use.
Consequently, the rapporteur should have had more consideration for the international implications of new technology and for existing and new legislation.
Finally, in order to narrow the knowledge gap, it is necessary for all groups of the population to be able to learn to use new technology.
The needs, conditions and infrastructure required must be identified for weak groups.
In that way, the integration of new technology can take place as early as at the development stage of new applications.
Specific groups can then receive additional support.
In a nutshell, the applications deserve more consideration than is evident in this report.
More emphasis on the listed policy aspects is required if we want to create a knowledge-based society which involves the entire population.
Mr President, first can I congratulate Malcolm Harbour, the rapporteur, on his own-initiative report on the Next Generation Internet: the need for an EU research initiative.
The degree of support for the report is indicated both by the fact that it was adopted unanimously in committee, and by the fact that there are no amendments.
The House certainly appears to be fully in support.
In the Socialist Group, we particularly support the high priority given to making sure that we include in the Sixth Framework Programme work on the Next Generation Internet, and that we develop a broad-banded infrastructure capability and a new super fast trans-European research network.
We want to make sure that EU research initiatives complement market-driven research, thereby avoiding conflict or duplication.
There are, however, at least four areas that are in need of clarification: first, in paragraph 2, we talk about the need for pre-competitive research.
We agree that it should be pre-competitive, not uncompetitive, which may be a different term.
The model we see is the Japanese model on research cartels where people work together during the development of a new technology before they go off and compete with each other when it gets close to the marketplace.
Secondly, in paragraph 7, we talk about it being technologically neutral.
That is fine, provided that is not an excuse for inaction where we wait for the technology to be determined.
We need to feed into that process and be flexible, but we also need to be active.
Thirdly on system security, it is clear that we need to be able to protect this Internet generation, and the next one, in terms of enabling people to engage in cash transactions and to transmit confidential information.
I hope that the Commission will look at both the technology and the legislation that is needed to ensure that the necessary levels of encryption can be put in place to protect the public, without aiding the criminals.
Finally, the key issues of universal access.
The Commission will have to ensure that we achieve this and that it is available to everybody, and not just those living in urban areas.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Malcolm Harbour on an unusually well-informed report which addresses many important issues.
This report also addresses the fact that the society of the future will be a mobile Internet society, and I believe that we Members are, in a way, guinea pigs as regards whether or not this mobility will work.
The report also shows the rapid rate of change that we are seeing in this area, the points of departure for the capital market being among the things that have changed since Mr Harbour' s work was completed.
The only thing that I would like to say to the Commissioner today is that I hope that the Commission' s organisation is sufficiently flexible to be able to take account of the need for cooperation between its different areas and to be able to react quickly to the changes required.
I also feel that account must be taken of this issue in the White Paper on European Governance.
Better coordination of the Commission' s activities is needed, as Mrs Mann also mentioned.
It is also evident that the Internet will lead to challenges for administrations, with open competition between administrations becoming the guiding principle - and the Commission will have to cope with this competition.
The admirable report by Malcolm Harbour invites us to look at our research initiative and we particularly welcome and support that aspect.
One point always needs underlining.
The kind of research needed here will include scientific research - research in physics, research in IT - but will also include socio-economic and legal research because of the points covered, particularly in paragraph 13, where we are dealing with these vital issues of privacy and data protection.
We will need to make sure that we have the regulatory mechanisms right and deal properly with the risks and threats as well as getting the technological fixes done correctly.
Can I also underline a point arising out of Clause 9 which Mr Hyland made: I am just back from a visit to the Outer Hebrides during the constituency week.
We can, with these technologies, cancel the disadvantages of the periphery and we can therefore turn round the age-old tendency of depopulation of our remote areas provided that we make available, for example, abundant low-cost expanded high band-breadth infrastructures with access on equitable terms.
We must ensure that the outlying places are brought into this.
Mr President, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for his excellent initiative.
The Commission very much appreciates the continued interest which the European Parliament and its Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has expressed in the development and establishment of an information society in Europe.
Indeed, in drawing up its reports on the Next Generation Internet, the industry committee has given a clear indication of the vital importance of the future development of this networking infrastructure.
The timing of the foreseen adoption of this report is very well chosen since the Commission is currently preparing the forthcoming communication of specific programmes implementing the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development in which issues included in Mr Harbour's report will be addressed.
Next Generation Internet, will be realised through developments in both technology and policy.
For Europe to remain competitive, it is first of all imperative to ensure a rapid and continued growth of the Internet as the key infrastructure for the global knowledge economy.
It is equally important for new policy measures to be taken as required in order to cope with the rapidly evolving development of the Internet world.
We have a number of instruments and resources - e-Europe, European research areas, the RGD Framework Programme, e-content, Ten Telecom, structural funds - to ensure a rapid development of the Next Generation Internet.
Appropriate coordination of our activities with those of the Member States and other European institutions will ensure that ambitious targets are pursued to the benefit of all Europeans and that access to new services is guaranteed also to those with special needs such as the disabled and the elderly.
As the main instrument available in Europe, the Framework Programme will support the research towards the development of the Next Generation Internet.
That work is already being supported through the current Fifth Framework Programme and will be strengthened in the Sixth Framework Programme.
Let me give some examples of our support to the Next Generation Internet: first, a strategic initiative on the IBV6, the next generation protocol, has recently been launched by the Commission and an industry-led task force has been created.
This will contribute to the rapid and continued evolution of the Internet and will also ensure that Europe's competitiveness in wireless technologies is not jeopardised in the long-term.
Moreover, through IBV6, Europe will be ready to provide the required connectivity to those billions of devices that will constitute the nervous system of the future information society.
Secondly, significant success towards the deployment of new electronic infrastructures has been achieved through the GÃ©ant project, a pan-European network covering both EU and associated countries.
Thirdly, the Commission takes good note of Parliament's call to be more ambitious in implementing the GÃ©ant project, as various Members have just indicated.
The aim is to provide highly advanced connectivity and services in Europe's national research and education networks at a level that allows them to play a leading role in cutting-edge research allowing the GÃ©ant to involve from 2.5 gigabits to 10 gigabits per second and thereafter to 100 gigabits per second in the coming years.
Fourthly, playing a central role in global cooperation with similar regional activities world-wide, for example the Internet II initiative in the United States, CANET4 in Canada and so on, GÃ©ant will provide the multiplier effect from which major infrastructural projects benefit.
In the Sixth Framework Programme for RTD, and of course our continuous liberalisation of telecommunication markets, the Commission is seeking to ensure that the infrastructure needed to support development of Next Generation Internet services in Europe is available.
It will directly support the research needed to allow development of new technologies in areas such as photonics, advanced software and hardware, and interfaces etc. Those research activities have to address important new requirements among which enhanced security plays a prime role.
The security issues will also be tackled in the upcoming communication on security of electronic networks that should be presented in time for the Gothenburg European Council.
Finally, let me stress that we are in full agreement with Mr Harbour and with his report in considering that the Next Generation Internet is strategically important to Europe.
We have a unique opportunity ahead of us to develop a networking infrastructure for the benefit of the research community and the European citizen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 11.00 a.m.

The next item is the report by Lord Inglewood (A5-0130/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC as regards the valuation rules for the annual and consolidated accounts of certain types of companies[COM(2000) 80 - C5-0106/2000 - 2000/0043(COD)].
In yesterday's Financial Times, Arthur Levitt, a former Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission wrote "Investors, public companies, accounting firms, stock markets and regulators around the world today face one of the great challenges for the global financial system's future: how to fashion an enduring system of comparable, uniform and high-quality financial reporting that is accepted just as much in Europe as it is in the US, and in developed countries as in emerging ones.
It is a challenge born less out of crisis and more out of evolutionary progress".
He continues "The explosive growth of markets and economies makes developing such a system an imperative.
All agree that there is simply no other way to ensure the efficient allocation of capital on a long-term and global basis."
This proposal is part of the European Union's wider response to the challenges described by Mr Levitt and, in particular, it deals with the problem of relatively new types of financial instruments, for example, derivatives and hedge funds.
This directive requires Member States to permit or require all or certain companies to adopt fair value, as opposed to historic cost accounting, where it is appropriate to do so and in the manner spelt out in the directive.
It creates a flexible regime and allows Member States considerable discretion in line with the application of the principle of subsidiarity, according to the circumstances as they see it.
It is intended as a first step towards establishing an accounting regime across Europe which meets the requirement of a modern global market place and which, in particular, will provide those who read company accounts with the kind of information they will want and should be entitled to know.
The proposal in front of the House today, together with the amendments - all of which were agreed unanimously in committee - are the result of close collaboration between myself, on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, and the Council and Commission, in an effort to reach an agreed formulation which could enable this directive to be dealt with in a single reading.
I believe that this work has been brought to a mutually satisfactory conclusion and I commend it.
Mr President, the report before us is undoubtedly not the most exciting of those we are to discuss in this sitting.
However, in saying this, I am not of course referring to Lord Inglewood' s excellent piece of work. We should congratulate him, and ourselves, on this.
Much can be achieved when, as a result of the codecision procedure, the European Parliament' s work improves the Commission' s proposals at a highly technical level, as it has in this instance. This not only makes a positive contribution to the process of drafting regulations, it also enhances the prestige of the European Parliament.
The argument for broadening the scope of the codecision procedure is therefore strengthened.
As I said a moment ago, this report does not give rise to keen argument.
That does not mean, however, that it lacks significance from a technical point of view. The proposal to update the directives on accounting is not only very important, it is in fact essential if the transparency of company accounts is to be improved.
Traditionally, the valuation rules for company accounts stipulated that assets be valued at cost price, referred to as the historic value.
This criterion was therefore invoked in the directives on accounting, as is logical in order to prevent the manipulation of accounts to present an inaccurate picture of a company' s status.
The aim was to prevent company directors from skilfully revaluing entries under assets to produce a distorted impression of the state of their business.
Incidentally, certain accounting irregularities which are not tolerated in company accounts, have been sanctioned in relation to the public accounts of a number of Member States, to allow them to join the euro.
In this instance, the euphemism 'creative accounting' has been used in place of 'irregularities' .
However, these accounting criteria relating to historic value were not cast in stone. Furthermore, the financial markets today are highly complex and the use of sophisticated financial products is increasing.
It is therefore necessary to replace historic value with fair value.
This fair value, included in the proposal for a directive that we are to approve, is obviously not as fixed as permanently as the historic value, given that its limits are much more loosely defined. Its inclusion requires more precise instruments, as provided in the proposed amendments we will support.
I now give the floor to Commissioner Bolkestein.
I would point out to the Commissioner that his time allocation runs until 11.00 a.m.
My message to you is therefore: go for it.
Mr President, I assume that you want me to focus on the topic in hand until 11.00 a.m. and that I am not being given the floor to talk about all kinds of other things, for example, Chancellor SchrÃ¶der' s latest document on architecture of the future Europe.
You want me to confine myself to today' s topic.
I am in a generous mood, Commissioner, but go ahead.
Mr President, I know my place, and we can therefore make a start on this subject matter.
May I reply as follows to the two interventions made, and in particular to the rapporteur.
As you may know, accounting is a European invention.
Five hundred years ago, Mr Lucia Patchioli, an Italian monk, developed the fundamentals of book-keeping which are still used today.
However important historic awareness may be, becoming historical is generally not a very positive notion.
This is what accounting in the European Union should not become.
The basic directive which deals with accounting, the fourth company law directive, is now more than twenty years old - it dates from 1978 - and although the directive forms a sound basis for accounting in the EU, it is hard to neglect substantial changes in business practices: capital markets, futures, stock options, leases, the Internet and the euro are all phenomena that, for the most part, did not exist in 1978.
Indeed, accounting has evolved to reflect these changes in business practice.
In 1995, the Commission started to be actively involved in the work of the International Accounting Standards Committee.
This involvement was concluded by the recently proposed regulation on International Accounting Standards (IAS), which I hope to discuss with this Parliament shortly.
At the moment, the Commission is also preparing to update the accounting directives: we will be presenting a proposal before the end of this year, as outlined in the Commission's communication on financial reporting in the European Union.
If you hear me talking about the proposed regulation and the modernisation of accounting directives, you may wonder why we need this proposal amending the accounting and bank accounts directives, thereby enabling the use of fair value for certain financial instruments.
Why do we need that proposal at all?
In recent years several Member States have introduced national legislation that allows their companies to use International Accounting Standards.
However, Member States cannot enact national laws that are not compliant with EU legislation, so IAS can only be applied to the extent that there are no conflicts with the accounting directives.
The fair-value concept, introduced in IAS, constitutes such conflicts and the proposal takes that conflict away by introducing fair value into the accounting directives.
A contrario, without this proposal, companies which at present use IAS could no longer do so when, from the financial year 2001, fair value becomes mandatory under IAS.
I should like to point out that the introduction of fair value in the accounting directives is in strict alignment with International Accounting Standards and does not allow the use of fair value beyond that.
Accounting is a technical and perhaps even esoteric issue.
Nevertheless, it is important to highlight the most important elements of this proposal.
The proposal defines fair value and those financial instruments that can be fair-valued in accordance with IAS.
Secondly, the proposal also lays down rules for Member States to define the scope of companies that shall be permitted or can be required to use fair value.
A Member State can, for example, permit or require fair value only for listed companies.
Thirdly, the proposal also requires that all companies disclose information on derivative financial instruments - options, swaps, futures - in the notes on the accounts which may have a significant impact on the financial position.
However, small companies can be excluded from this disclosure.
One of Parliament's amendments seeks to include banks within the scope of the proposal.
The Commission supports this amendment from the point of view of a single EU market.
Banks and other companies compete for capital on the same capital market.
Comparable financial statements are a crucial element allowing an efficient allocation of capital to companies and ensuring sufficient investor protection.
The Commission carefully examines the amendments to its proposal and, in this instance, supports all proposed Amendments Nos 1 to 32.
In conclusion, I hope that Parliament and the rapporteur will contribute to prevent accounting in the EU becoming historical.
We want it to be up-to-date and forward-looking.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place in Strasbourg.
(The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed at 11.00 a.m.)
Mr President, I wish to make a brief point of order.
I was due to leave for Washington on Tuesday with the Delegation of Coordinators of the temporary Committee of Enquiry on 'ECHELON' , which was to make an official visit to the United Nations from 9 to 11 May.
The United States Ambassador to Brussels has now informed me that my visa has been refused for political reasons, that the file had gone to Washington and the United States Embassy advised me to cancel my trip with the delegation.
If it were possible, Mr President, I should like Parliament' s Bureau to take this matter up with the American authorities, as Mr Wurtz, Chairman of the GUE/NGL Group has already done, because I think it would be a scandal if the United States government could decide on who should be a member of a European Parliament delegation.
(Applause from the left)
Mr Krivine, I have taken note of your important statement.
I hope that it will be passed to the Bureau as quickly as possible, so that we can clear up this matter properly, which is indeed extremely serious.
I rise on a point of order.
You will no doubt be aware of the serious problems concerning the provision of secondary education in my region of Northamptonshire.
With me today in the public gallery is a mother of two from Earls Barton near Wellingborough whose eldest son is due to enter secondary education in September.
He has recently petitioned this Parliament because his Local Education Authority has failed to allocate him a place in any of the schools of his choice in his local area, even after what can only be described as a flawed appeals process.
This is the same Local Education Authority that, until last week, was failing to provide any education or school places to 20 children in the same area.
Will the President please write to the British Government to clarify how this sits with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, especially Article 14(3), the right to education, which I believe specifically covers Lucy Payne's case and the concerns of many other parents across Northamptonshire.
Mr Heaton-Harris, Parliament takes note of the issues you have raised and the competent authorities shall be informed as quickly as possible.
Mr President, we have been informed that a press conference, organised by Mr Vattimo, took place this morning to promote an Italian book which is clearly libellous: a book which has already been condemned in Italy, a book which libels a member of the Italian parliament.
In my opinion, the left is, once again, displaying its tendency here to exploit the institutions for the clear purposes of Italian electoral campaigning.
I would like to ask you, Mr President, who authorised the use of the room for these purposes.
I know that the title of the press conference was changed so that the room could be used, in the sense that the reference to the electoral campaign was removed from the title, but the subject of the conference was clearly the Italian electoral campaign.
Mr Gawronski, we shall indeed investigate the content of that meeting.
I want to come back to the point Mr Krivine raised in relation to our ECHELON delegation to the United States.
This is an extremely important and serious issue.
What is happening is that the United States has decided to refuse entry to a democratically-elected Member of this Parliament for political reasons.
This is completely unacceptable.
Who are the United States to decide, for political reasons, that a democratically-elected Member of this Parliament is not allowed to enter?
The United States clearly has double standards: they have allowed many others to enter, including Gerry Adams and Nelson Mandela, with various pasts.
Now they are deciding because they do not like the politics of a specific Member of this Parliament that they are going to refuse entry.
This is a diplomatic issue and one that must be raised urgently.
Mrs McKenna, I think that Parliament has noted the seriousness of the statement that Mr Krivine has just made.
The matter shall be followed up thoroughly.
Mr President, I would like to start by asking the Presidency to pay greater attention when Members are asking for the floor. This is the fourth time that I have been unable to speak.
Moving on, I would like to draw the attention of the President and of Parliament to the events in Italy, where our fellow Member, Emma Bonino, together with other Members of the European Parliament, is on a thirst and hunger strike to secure the right to media coverage during the electoral campaign.
Alongside Emma Bonino are handicapped people such as Luca Coscioni as well, who is abstaining from painkillers in order to capture the attention of the President of the Republic.
It would be appropriate for the European Parliament to set up an observatory to monitor the Italian elections, in order to see whether an effective information flow is truly guaranteed to all in a problematic election campaign such as the Italian campaign.
We have taken note of your statement.
Mr President, I have been informed that Mr Gawronski spoke a few minutes ago in condemnation of the fact that a press conference was organised - I organised it myself - on freedom of information, in which a book was discussed which Mr Gawronski describes as libellous.
This book does nothing more than draw attention to all the documents underlying, amongst other things, a request for waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Dell'Utri and Mr Berlusconi, a request which lies before Parliament.
This is not a libellous book at all; it is a book which brings to the attention of the European Union documents which are of interest also and precisely for Parliament, for us to consider when we debate - I do not know when - the request for waiver of the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Members, Mr Dell'Utri and Mr Berlusconi, who should, at last, be brought to justice for these matters.
I would like to ask a question about the use of Parliament's facilities by the PPE-DE in relation to the elections in the Basque country.
Could you please pass this request on to the Presidency.
I would like a straightforward answer about the use of this Parliament's facilities.
Vote
On behalf of the Commission, I should like to confirm the Commission's position on the two amendments proposed to the common position.
Amendment 1 would allow BSE-free Member States to act unilaterally against imports of live animals.
That is against the principle of Community rules and superfluous since the common position includes harmonised rules for the marketing of animals in the light of the BSE status.
Amendment 2 would make it more difficult to establish a clear epidemiological picture of the incidence of BSE in contradiction to Parliament's resolution of last November.
For those reasons, and also with a view to putting in place the proper legal framework for the control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies...
(Applause, calls of "encore!") .... transmissible spongiform encephalopathies without delay, the Commission cannot accept either of these amendments.
I hope that my pronunciation of this word with which I am not very familiar was clear to Parliament.
(The President declared the common position adopted)
Report (A5-0318/2000) by Mr Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents [COM(2000) 30 - C5-0057/2000 - 2000/0032(COD)]
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
Report (A5-0125/2001) by Mrs Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the animal-health requirements applicable to non-commercial movement of pet animals [COM(2000) 529 - C5-0477/2000 - 2000/0221(COD)]
Relating to Amendment No 4
As regards Amendment No 4, the wording of the final version is different to the proposal adopted in the committee.
This wording is more far-reaching.
At the end of the original version, the wording was "with the aim of trying to achieve harmonisation"; in the new version it says "with the aim of harmonising".
Relating to Amendment No 14
I would like to propose an oral amendment whereby the word 'ferret' is moved from Part B in Annex 1 to Part A.
(Since more than 12 Members were opposed to voting on the oral amendment, it was not put to the vote)
Mr President, Mr Arvidsson has twice tried to point out a difference in Amendment No 4.
You have not said anything but you intimated that Amendment No 4, as passed today, is different from what it was in committee.
At least, so you intimated.
I assume, just to clarify matters, that we are going by what was submitted today.
Mr President, I agree with the European Farmer Coordination and I believe that the root of the mad cow disease problem lies in intensive methods of animal production and the misguided policy on foodstuffs pursued by the European Union ever since the creation of the CAP in 1962.
The best way to prevent the transmission of encephalopathies is to promote the controlled production of milk and beef. Such production would be based on local pasture and fodder.
The quality of what is produced would be more important than the quantity. If these huge fodder imports are not investigated, the European Union will continue to act as a factory processing imported vegetable products to produce animal products.
This state of affairs results in an enormous financial burden and a range of problems, relating to surpluses, quality, health and the environment. These have been described by other Members on numerous occasions.
Fortunately, the majority of European herds are not contaminated. In particular, these include animals fed on grass and natural fodder produced on the farm itself, and not raised on industrial foodstuffs.
These are the very animals the CAP has been ignoring for 40 years, and which we must now promote in order to protect the health of the people of Europe.
Mr President, it is no fault of mine if - probably because there has been a lot of talk about my dream of Mrs Roth-Behrendt during this past month - I dreamt about her again last night.
It was a more restful dream than the previous one.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt was in good health and leading an army of pensioners who were waving placards bearing the words "Long live Mrs Roth-Behrendt".
I went up to them and asked them why they were carrying placards saying "Long live Mrs Roth Behrendt" and not "Long live Mr Fatuzzo".
They replied: "We are pensioners who like to eat well, to eat steak with Brunello di Montalcino wine.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt is ensuring that the beef we eat is healthy and we therefore admire her and are celebrating her victory".
Thus, I could not fail to vote for the motion.
Debates of recent months have highlighted and prioritised the public health aspect of European and national food policy of which BSE is the most significant.
Therefore, future agricultural and environmental policy must reflect our experiences in this crucial area of food production.
Failure on the part of Member States to fully conform to new guidelines and regulations must not be tolerated.
Food is an internationally tradeable product and with consumers crossing frontiers on a daily basis, nothing short of a co-ordinated and common approach to food safety as spearheaded by the EU will restore consumer confidence in the entire food chain, and while there is a cost factor, particularly for farmers, it is I believe strongly in the interests of agriculture and individual farm families, that full confidence is restored as quickly as possible in all agricultural products.
Member States have taken positive and expensive steps to deal with BSE.
The foot-and-mouth outbreak, which does not present a health risk, has to some extent overshadowed the very genuine steps taken to finally eliminate BSE from the European herd.
The action taken was scientifically based and I believe we are close to bringing this public health scare to a successful - and with strict adherence to production controls to a permanent - conclusion.
While acknowledging the weight of the scientific evidence on the connection of BSE and CJD with the use of meat and bonemeal, it must be borne in mind that the level of BSE infestation proportionate to the individual herds in Member States is significantly small and is of course confined to a relatively short production cycle.
Animals infected or at risk are now considerably reduced in numbers.
We must never again experience the traumatic events of recent months and the understandable consumer concern with regard to food safety.
Cashman report (A5-0318/2001)
Mr President, in order to decide which way to vote on Mr Cashman's extremely important report on public access to the documents of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, before I left for Rome, I discussed the matter with my mother, who is very interested in the proceedings of the European Parliament.
She said to me: "That is very interesting, but what is the Council?
It is never mentioned on Italian television.
What is the Commission?
It is never mentioned on Italian television.
I know what the Parliament is because you have become a Member of it."
I therefore concluded that, in addition to having access to documents, it would be a good thing for the European citizens to know something about the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission.
The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for the report by Mr Cashman on a proposal for a Regulation regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents because we believe that an acceptable compromise has been reached and because we believe that the forces that wish for much greater openness and access have achieved more in the negotiations than the countries and forces that have sought to maintain closed systems.
At the same time, it is our assessment that we would not have achieved a better result by letting the matter go to a second reading.
In our assessment of the compromise, we attached particular importance to the principles that, as a starting point, all documents should be included, including internal documents, that the number of exceptions should be reduced, and that these should be well-founded, that requests should be dealt with more quickly than was originally proposed and that it should be established that Danish authorities will continue to deal with requests for access to documents in accordance with Danish rules.
If a system is to enjoy our citizens' confidence, it is not sufficient for it merely to be open under the rules. Instead, it must also be experienced as being open.
A great deal of work remains to be done here by citizens and the press, who must use the new rules actively and who must also test the limits of these new rules.
It is our hope that the coming years will show all the forces that are sceptical about transparency that it benefits not just democracy but also the institutions' own internal work for the public to have access to the documents being worked on.
