However, in the near future, we plan to develop a common citizens' guide on all three institutions. I hope this will happen soon.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have outlined all the work that the Commission has undertaken to implement this regulation on access to documents.
This work will of course be followed up by an interinstitutional committee. The committee will be set up shortly and will establish a firm foundation for our cooperation in implementing this new regulation.
Minister, I was pleased to hear you refer to the compromise proposal made by my colleague Mrs Loyola de Palacio on 28 November in the three-way discussion.
She put it forward because a solution has to be found.
I would like to thank you Minister for having noted that Mrs de Palacio put forward this compromise proposal with due regard for Parliament' s concern that political authority should play its full part in the interinstitutional committee.
In order to apply the regulation, each institution has worked independently to modify their own Rules of Procedure when they judged it appropriate.
For its part, the Commission will continue to respect this independence.
The Commission hopes to respect the spirit and the letter of this new regulation, which, we believe, represents a real step forward in terms of transparency and democracy within the European Union.
Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, Minister, the public access to documents regulation, better known as the Act on the public nature of Government, was approved in May this year after protracted negotiations.
My colleague Mr Cashman, the President Mr Watson and myself were very closely involved in this.
It was agreed at the time that the practical implementation had to be ready by 3 December, and that applied to all three institutions - the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
The registers were to be ready by 3 June 2002, and today is 12 December.
Where are we now, one week on from 3 December?
Parliament approved its revised Rules of Procedure on 13 November, and Parliament' s Bureau saw to its implementation on 28 November.
So as far as we are concerned, everything is in order.
However, as Parliament we feel partly responsible for what the Commission and the Council do, and that is why we have opened this debate.
First the Council: the Council adapted its Rules of Procedure to the regulation on 29 November and published them on 3 December - just in time, in other words.
Two comments: firstly an earlier comment about the Solana decisions.
It is not entirely clear from the Rules of Procedure whether or not the Solana decisions have been overruled by the regulation.
Can Mrs Neyts please once again give us a very clear answer on this?
And then a comment about Article 12, Paragraph 5, of the Council Decision, which states that notes, letters and suchlike relating to legislation and addressed to the Coreper, for example, are indeed covered by the regulation. However, Article 6 states that if Member States make comments about European legislation with regard to the Council or the Coreper in individual notes or letters, these do not have to be published.
It seems to me that this is not acceptable.
In the Netherlands, letters from a municipality to the national government always have to be published, and it seems to me that this should also be the case for Member States in respect of the Council.
And then the Commission; the Commission implemented an amendment to the Rules of Procedure on 28 November and approved it on 5 December.
Now, I am not quibbling over the two days' delay, but I do have a few comments to make.
The first is that the Commission has decentralised the implementation of the regulation.
Is that wise?
However, I have now heard Mr Barnier say that there will be one PO box and one e-mail address after all.
So why is that not spelled out clearly in the Rules of Procedure? I cannot find it.
My second comment is about the following problem: why hasn' t the Commission produced a clear definition of the term 'document' , as Parliament and the Council have done?
My third point is Article 8 of the Commission Decision.
Why is it so vague about the author of the document? Is his name not allowed to be known if he is an official?
After all, he puts his signature to it in this position, so I believe that this should fall under openness.
It is also not entirely clear what will happen with the agencies.
The Commissioner has said something about that, but has the Commission initiated anything in this area?
And then the security rules.
Nothing has been published about these either.
Why have the Council' s security rules been published and not the Commission' s?
And now to my last comment, and I would like to pick up on Mrs Neyts' point.
I do not know whether it is wise to have an interinstitutional committee on a non-political level.
Do you have to do this on an official level?
I am very hesitant about that.
I think that more consultation is needed on this point; at least we have stated in our Rules of Procedure that one of our Vice-Presidents would have to be responsible for it and Parliament would have to back this pronouncement.
Mr President, first of all let me remind both the Council and Commission that the purpose of the regulation is: "to give the fullest possible effect to the right of public access to documents and to lay down the general principles and limits on such access".
When looking at the Council and Commission decisions, I see an attempt to rewrite the regulation, in particular references to it in Article 9 of the Commission decision - documents which do not reflect opinions or individual opinions will not be made available.
The same applies to Article 11 of the Council decision.
I should like to remind both the Council and Commission that a restriction on access to documents can only refer to the exemptions listed in Article 4 and Article 9, which in turn relate back to Article 4.
Equally, in the Commission's proposals, third country nationals are denied the right of complaint to the European Ombudsman - again, a violation of the spirit of the regulation.
Under delegated powers the Commission believes it will not make legislative papers available until adoption of the final text.
I would remind the House and the Commission that 90% of some 5 000 legislative acts adopted every year in the Union are under delegated powers.
The Council has widened access to some of its internal documents, but maintains confidentiality on Member State demands on national delegations and national positions.
Why is it that six months after the regulation entered into force, no information campaign has been launched by the institutions?
Why?
When are we going to have the Commission's proposals on amending secondary legislation?
Has the Commission adopted security rules?
If so, can it publish them according to the regulations?
When will Parliament adopt its own security rules?
I am extremely worried that if someone were now to approach and gain access via either the Commission's decision or the Council's decision we would see a violation of the regulation.
Furthermore, I should like to echo Mrs Maij-Weggen's very important point.
It is not acceptable that we should have secretaries-general representing politicians in this interinstitutional committee.
Politicians must be accountable and responsible for their decisions.
Mr President, I also subscribe to those questions which my colleagues have put to the Council and to the Commission.
In particular, I would like to ask that this committee for interinstitutional cooperation finally be established, in order that genuine transparency can be brought into effect as required by this Regulation.
I also share the view of Mr Cashman that Parliament cannot approve the secretaries-general carrying on discussions of these matters in the name of the politicians, since transparency is, as a basic question of democracy, a highly political matter.
Now we must also look at what will be our future challenges once (hopefully) all these open questions with regard to this Regulation are resolved.
This has been an important first step, but we still have lots of new challenges.
I would like to mention some of these.
In my opinion, what threatens to become an even larger problem is the matter which Mr Watson, Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, mentioned in a seminar yesterday: this anti-terrorist activity and the questions of the third pillar are leading towards an intolerable situation, since the Council continues to enact these anti-terrorism laws behind tightly closed doors, and the Parliament has virtually zero influence in these matters.
In my opinion we must meet this challenge; questions of the third pillar must be properly brought within the sphere of public access to documents. Otherwise, there will be no democratic responsibility of any kind as far as these matters are concerned.
Secondly, I wish to mention a problem which relates to the protection of personal data.
In my view we have a genuine problem here as well.
Certainly we must protect personal data, but we cannot approve a situation where (for example) the names and personal details of representatives of industry who are taking part in Commission negotiations can be kept secret in the name of data protection.
No, this idea is erroneous; and in these matters we must be careful to operate on the side of transparency, and so we certainly have our work cut out for us.
'May we see the telephone directory?'
'Sorry, this has certainly not been classified information for two years, but you cannot be given it.'
'How many laws are there?'
'Sorry, we are not counting.'
'How many projects are you running?'
'We stopped counting when we reached 100 000.'
'How many committees are there?'
'Sorry, that is a secret.'
'Who takes part in the preparative meetings?'
'That is unfortunately something we do not know.'
'But you pay travel expenses, do you not?'
'Sorry, we do not know whom we pay these to.'
'May I see which laws are being negotiated with the twelve applicant countries, together with the screening reports?'
'Sorry.'
Those are the types of answer which we, who have been elected to monitor the Commission and the Council, have received.
Like the Ombudsman, the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, we are unable to obtain what ought to be available to elected representatives in all parliaments.
On 3 December, the regulation on public access to documents came into force.
We were right there with a renewed request to scrutinise the documentation, but the officials discovered that there was nothing to be made available on the basis of the new rules, either.
We have asked for a complete list of committees and working parties and the members of these.
We have asked for details of the enlargement negotiations and to see the declarations and statements associated with current laws.
When we debated the regulation on public access to documents, Parliament' s rapporteurs expected us to be able to obtain that type of information in the future.
I should therefore like to ask our rapporteurs if they will be involved in taking proceedings against the Commission if our renewed request for access to documents also fails in the end to produce a satisfactory answer.
Mr President, most people say they believe in open and transparent government.
I am quite sure the Commission and the Council are genuine in what they say.
I congratulate them on the progress made so far but none of us should deceive ourselves into thinking that we do not need a lot more work before Europe is truly open and transparent.
I want to use my time to cite just one example - a petition to the European Parliament from various names at Lloyds of London.
The petition claims that the United Kingdom Government has not properly applied the EU insurance directives.
As a result of the petition the Commission very properly submitted, over a year ago, questions to the United Kingdom Government.
That is when secrecy and cover-up begin.
The Commission has allowed members of the Committee on Petitions - but only members - to see the actual questionnaire, and then only under extremely stringent conditions.
Why not reveal the questions to the public, why not to the petitioners?
The Commission would show it is doing its job.
As for the answers, they are top secret.
Nobody is allowed to know them - neither the Members of Parliament nor the petitioners - nobody.
The UK Government says it is an informal communication and that it does not reveal informal communications.
The Commission says that under the Framework Agreement it is not allowed to reveal the answers because there may be legal proceedings.
The British Government does not have a leg to stand on.
If this is not a formal communication, I would like to know what is.
The Commission may have some argument, but I would remind the Commissioner of the Zwartveld judgement.
In 1990 the Commission refused access to documents because it claimed there might be legal proceedings.
The ECJ insisted that the documents were presented.
So I would say to the Commissioner this afternoon - you have made some progress but I can give you this example to show that a great deal of progress is still needed in this respect.
Mr President, we are talking today about the implementation of the regulation on public access to documents: the famous Act on the public nature of Government.
We had a nice compromise, the best result we could have achieved this spring, a reasonable improvement on the Commission' s original proposals and the existing Rules of Procedure.
We have essentially brought together the best practices of our Member States to form a new European standard.
What we now have to do is to implement it, of course, and we must do all we can to really make it a success.
As the European Parliament, we naturally want to keep a very close eye on how this will be done in practice, and my colleagues Mr Cashman and Mrs Maij-Weggen have put forward a series of in-depth questions and comments which I wholeheartedly support.
We attach a great deal of importance to the annual report which will be issued about the implementation of the public access regulation and it is very significant for us that we have heard the Council' s and the Commission' s explanation here today.
When I hear the comments about the institutional tale of the Secretaries-General, I am of the same opinion as my colleagues; namely that it sounds as if we are putting it on an official institutional level instead of on a political one.
If you say general and policy criteria, then I would rather speak on a political level.
The 3 December deadline came around very quickly, of course, and we ourselves were only ready in November.
We now have to put our money where our mouth is.
But then I look at the Council and I notice that the documents relating to the Justice and Home Affairs Council have not yet been released, or that not all documents have been included in the register.
Then things start getting tricky again, because then I think: let' s make giving access to our citizens our number one priority, otherwise it sounds as if we are being contemptuous.
I have two specific questions for the Commission and the Council in addition to my colleagues' questions.
How many sensitive documents have been included in the register so far?
How are the Commission and the Council informing citizens about the possibilities offered by the Act on the public nature of Government, apart from the guide which Commissioner Barnier announced?
The Act on the public nature of Government is to be evaluated in 2004.
If it then turns out that the regulation does not guarantee sufficient public access, it will be our duty as Parliament to make sure that it does, because we must never lose sight of the fact that the picture that our citizens have of us sitting working in little closed rooms must never be accurate.
This regulation is a fantastic way of doing this differently, but we will have to ensure that it is not just a series of fine words and that it can actually be implemented in practice.
I am greatly looking forward to hearing the answers, particularly to my colleagues' critical questions.
Mr President, I am sorry that my comments have to be directed at Commissioner Barnier, whom I hold in the highest regard, because my complaint applies to a different Commissioner.
As a member of the Committee on Petitions, and to follow on from what Mr Perry has already said, I should point out that this is not the first time the Commission has refused to divulge the contents of documents and other records which we need to see if we are to draw the right conclusions and make the right decisions in cases where European citizens have taken recourse to the European Parliament.
This refusal on the part of the Commission infringes, in my view, the principle of transparency and hampers the Committee on Petitions in its work.
The main excuse for the Commission's refusal is that the information and documents requested would disclose sensitive personal data.
The merits of this contention are contested both by the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman.
To give you an example, the Commission refuses to give us the names of the representatives of a professional organisation whom it consulted and who, it appeared, influenced its decision.
We deny that this is how personal data is protected and are worried that a possibly less than transparent deal is being hushed up.
Mr Perry also referred to the LloydÂŽs affair.
I have to tell you that this hush-up conceals bankrupt companies, a great deal of human misery and several suicides, which is why the report by the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Gemelli, which Plenary adopted today, calls for the powers and efficiency of the Committee on Petitions to be enhanced so that petitioners can obtain justice promptly and avert irreparable damage, for example to the environment or cultural monuments.
Mr President, Commissioner, I will limit myself to answering the questions that have been asked, the question from the rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, as to whether the new decisions overrule the so-called Solana decisions; the answer is yes, they do.
As far as the committee on an institutional level is concerned, I would reiterate that the Council has no objections at all to this committee starting work; the only question is whether it will be beneficial for the presidents to meet and take the decisions?
If it is a question of general principles, I do in fact believe that it will have to be the presidents who do this, although this is only my personal point of view.
The solution I have outlined does in fact provide for this.
The only thing that I personally do not regard as a favourable development is the situation where the presidents would become a kind of court of appeal, as it were, if a common decision not to permit access to a certain document or a certain type of document has been taken at the highest official level.
I think that the result will be like a game of ping-pong right up to the highest official level.
I would, however, like to emphasise that the political level is of course always accessible and politically responsible for what the official level decides, including what the highest official level decides.
I do not understand the distinction that some of you are making, as if the official level should by definition not be responsible and the political level should be to the greatest possible degree.
This is not the case; this is not my philosophy; it may be yours, but I do not share it.
I think that we must take another clear look at these things.
It has been pointed out that there are a number of Council documents relating to justice and home affairs that have not yet been included in the Register.
That is right.
We are waiting for the Rules of Procedure on guaranteeing the security of documents, which your Parliament has yet to vote on.
Until such time as this has been done, we find it particularly difficult to make highly sensitive documents accessible, even to your worthy institution.
Mr President, I would now like to respond in as much detail as possible to those who have contributed to the debate.
In general, I am not surprised at the expressions of impatience and vigilance, and at the calls for further action directed at the Commission.
Mrs Maij-Weggen, you reminded us, although I had already done so, that the Commission arrived at its decision after several days extra delay, which we really needed. As you can imagine, I took part in all these debates within the College to assess the implications of this new system, this new instrument for the internal organisation of the Commission.
However, I have assured you, very candidly, that these extra days we required in no way prevented the system from coming into operation on 3 December. Ladies and gentlemen, there have indeed been results since 3 December, as I said to Mr Bonde, who asked me about this.
Since then, we have already received quite a number of inquiries.
These have been processed by the Commission' s services, according to the new procedures. Mrs Maij-Weggen, the register you mentioned will come into operation in June, on 3 June next year.
You also remarked that there is some uncertainty over the author of the report, as did Mr Cashman. We refer to the author of the document in Article 8 of our text.
We have not gone into further details on this as, naturally, the author' s description depends on the nature of the document. Documents may be written by an institution, another public authority, a natural person, a civil servant or a private company.
I would therefore like to explain that the precise description of the author depends of course on the nature of the document. However, this register will indeed come into operation on 3 June next year, we are working to meet this deadline.
Mrs Maij-Weggen, I would also like to say that the Secretariat-General has a centralised management structure. As I said a few minutes ago, we have, for instance, an e-mail address, a postal address and a fax number that can be used.
We can therefore reply to people if they write to any specific Directorate-General.
If a problem arises, the Secretariat-General acts as arbitrator.
However, we have a central main address and the Directorates-General can reply. Of course, the decision is taken in the first instance by the Directorate-General which produced the document.
I would now like to address the definition of the document, a subject you are all concerned with. Mrs Maij-Weggen, as I said when I spoke a few minutes ago, we did indeed restrict ourselves to reading the text of the regulation which gives a broad and neutral definition.
This was the wish of the Community legislator and we did not want to limit the scope of our own Rules of Procedure.
As regards the security rules, which you and Mr Cashman also mentioned, I can confirm that these rules, adopted at the end of November, will be published very shortly. Publication is only being delayed by legal and language issues.
I would like to ask for your understanding on this matter. However, the security rules will be published very shortly.
In any case, in the light of what you both said on this matter, we will further increase the speed of work towards publication.
Mr Cashman, you also referred to the need for a publicity campaign.
I promise you we will ensure that information on this new regulation, the arrangements entailed and the new provisions available to citizens is disseminated as widely as possible. Unless I am very much mistaken, the three European institutions decided not to hold a publicity campaign on this regulation at the forum of the inter-institutional technical working party.
However, we will publicise the existence of this citizens' guide thorough our website and all our documents.
The citizens' guide will be available online in the near future.
We will henceforth promote this transparency and openness as endorsed or extended by this regulation.
Mrs Hautala, you mentioned the issue of the inter-institutional committee, as did Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, I cannot elaborate further on what I have already said, though I do appreciate Parliament' s concern over a sense of political responsibility.
Mrs de Palacio' s compromise proposal endeavours to go as far as possible towards meeting Parliament' s wishes. I think you understand this.
To sum up, I told Mr Bonde that we have had results. We are receiving our first inquiries and we are processing them according to the new regulation.
Mr Perry and Mr van den Berg bear out this concern for vigilance.
I believe that this regulation can bring about real progress. Maybe other regulations will go further.
We will see the effects of change as we go along. I promise that the Commission is wholeheartedly committed to implementing this regulation.
I would now like to address the need for transparency and democracy as far as citizens are concerned.
The regulation is an initial response to this.
We must also respond in other ways.
This is also one of the issues of institutional reform and the Laeken Declaration. It is also the subject of the open debate that will be possible within the framework of the convention and the forthcoming reform in 2004.
In my opinion there is still much to be done to increase transparency and democracy and to ensure citizens are more closely involved in the decisions we take.
Then, Mr Marinos asked me a question on the ability of the Committee on Petitions to access documents.
Access is of course possible, though we must respect the protection of personal data. The documents of third parties can be accessed but they remain protected by Article 4 of the regulation, which must be adhered to.
Lastly, Mr Cashman asked me a question on the significant issue of the Ombudsman.
I would like to respond to this.
Although I know that you are aware of this, I would like to confirm that the Treaty and the very statute of the Ombudsman means that complaints from third-country citizens living outside the Union cannot be dealt with. This is all I wanted to say to you.
Thank you again for your contributions and your vigilance.
Your reactions came as no surprise to me. We shall henceforth take them into account when implementing this regulation in a specific and operational manner.
Mr President, I would like to put a question to the Commissioner.
Is this the way in which the principle of transparency is to be applied, for two days ago it was impossible to discover which regulations you had adopted on access to documents.
It is reminiscent of Orwell' s Animal Farm, where some are more equal than others.
Despite searching, I have been unable to obtain access to your decision.
This is not the way that transparency should function, with its taking more than a week to obtain information.
Secondly, your reaction to the special report of the Ombudsman which was approved...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, the Commissioner intimates that we have been given an answer.
We have not.
We tried to renew our old request to Mr Prodi. That was agreed.
The same day, officials told us that nothing at all new could be made available under the new regulation.
So there is nothing new.
We had raised another question with Mr Prodi in the Conference of Presidents.
We were given promises from both...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, this debate has been quite unsatisfactory and, under the pertinent rule in our Rules of Procedure, I wish to propose to my committee and to the House that we have a resolution to close this debate, to vote on it at our January part-session, and to look at what further action we need to take, given the quite unsatisfactory nature of the responses from the Council and Commission.
Yes, that is a suggestion we will take up.
Mr President, on a point of order, I made quite a serious allegation that there was an attempt to rewrite the regulation.
That has not been addressed.
I maintain that allegation in that both the Council and Commission have introduced a new mandatory and blanket exception on the basis of opinions or individual opinions.
This is not contained in the regulation.
I direct honourable Members to Article 4(3) - public interest disclosure.
It has to be proven that such disclosure would undermine the institution's ability to function.
Mr President, I understand that the debate is closed, but I am here and I am ready to continue.
I am trying to understand why the Chairman, Mr Watson, has said that we have failed to answer the questions.
I have tried to take note of all contributions as quickly as possible. I have also tried to respond in as much detail as possible to at least the main questions, which I was naturally able to answer immediately.
I am willing to appear again before your committee, Mr Watson, and to continue this dialogue.
I have explained the spirit in which the Commission took this decision a few days ago.
The communication to which you refer, Mrs Thors, is certainly possible. I shall endeavour to let you have a copy of our decision, if you have been unable to obtain a copy through any other means.
I have informed you that since 3 December citizens have been able to access Commission documents within the terms of this regulation. We will provide concrete confirmation of this trend, and we remain wholeheartedly committed to applying the spirit and letter of this regulation.
I have tried to respond as fully and as sincerely as possible to the questions put to me. I feel that I had to reiterate this point, Mr President, with your permission.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B5-0536/2001).
We will examine questions to the Council
We welcome Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, President-in-Office of the Council.
As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 1 to 4 will be taken together.
Question No 1 by (H-0861/01):
Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of constitutional regions in the process of European integration.
You can count on it, and I am speaking on my own behalf and on behalf of Belgium, that we will do our utmost to broach this subject. But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated.
In a joint declaration issued at the end of May, seven constitutional regions expressed a clear, united position in favour of greater Treaty-based involvement in the European project.
At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, EU Member States promoted the Convention procedure to prepare for further reform of the EU/EC Treaties.
Does the Council endorse the request by Catalonia, Salzburg, Scotland, Flanders, Wallonia, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia to be directly involved in the Convention to prepare for further reform of the EU/EC Treaties?
If not, why is it opposed to greater Treaty-based involvement of constitutional regions in mapping out the future of Europe?
Question No 2 by (H-0862/01):
Subject: Regions' powers in a globalised world In Nice an additional Declaration on the future of the Union was annexed to the Treaty.
It offered, inter alia, the prospect of a more precise delimitation of powers between the EU and the Member States, reflecting the principle of subsidiarity.
I am not alone in thinking that regions with greater powers within the European Union are a precondition for a more workable, democratic and transparent Europe.
Furthermore, such European regions are closer to citizens and form a new framework with which the latter can identify, preventing movements such as that of the 'democratic globalists' becoming a movement feeding off anti-European sentiment.
The Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament have a duty, at this key point in the process of European integration, to be resolute and united in opting for a clear division of powers between the EU, the Member States and the regions.
Does the Council intend to give concrete shape to the concept of the delimitation of powers between the Union, the Member States and the regions at Laeken?
If so, how precise is this delimitation to be, and will adequate account be taken of the subsidiarity principle?
If not, does the Council consider itself to be sufficiently armed in the face of the growing gap between European citizens and institutions and in the face of growing antipathy within certain movements to all forms of expansion in scale whether at European or world level?
Question No 3 by , which has been taken over by Josu Ortuondo Larrea(H-0863/01):
Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency-in-Office of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of different nationalities and constitutional regions in the process of European integration.
You can count on it, and I am speaking on my own behalf and on behalf of Belgium, that we will do our utmost to broach this subject. But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated.
At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, the Laeken declaration and the future of the European Union were discussed.
In connection with the process of establishing a constitution for the European Union, which, for some, goes hand in hand with simplification of the Treaties, does the Council intend to ensure that the principle of constitutional pluralism is enshrined in the Laeken declaration, so that the constitutions of the Member States and their nationalities and states exist independently of, and do not depend for their validity on, a possible EU constitution?
Question No 4 by (H-0864/01):
Subject: Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration On Wednesday, 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency-in-Office of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of constitutional regions in the process of European integration.
You can count on it, and I am speaking on my own behalf and on behalf of Belgium, that we will do our utmost to broach this subject. But there are also 14 other Member States, and it will therefore be important that the constitutional regions ensure they themselves work closely in harmony, Ms Neyts stated.
At the informal European Council meeting in Ghent on 19 October, the Laeken declaration was discussed.
Are the powers and position of internal political entities in the Member States in respect of their relations with the EU institutions in an executive, legislative and legal connection to be enshrined in the Laeken declaration?
If not, why does the Council oppose recognition in the Laeken declaration of the powers and position of internal political entities in the Member States in respect of their relations with the EU institutions in an executive, legislative and legal connection?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in response to the questions by Mr Bart Staes, Mr Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n, Mr Miquel Mayol i Raynal and Mrs Nelly Maes concerning the content of the future Laeken Declaration, the Council can only in the first instance refer to future discussions of the European Council which are yet to take place.
It is indeed up to the European Council to adopt the practical rules and the framework of ideas for the Convention which has to prepare the forthcoming IGC.
This framework should encompass, inter alia, the list of the issues to be discussed, as well as give indications as to how these issues could be tackled most effectively.
The Council will not confine itself to the description of the above-mentioned elements, but will also remind us that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference must find concrete answers to the questions raised.
However, in the light of the Declaration of Nice regarding the Union' s future, it is obvious that one of the topics that will need to be discussed in the next few months is a more clearly defined demarcation of powers between the European Union and the Member States pursuant to the subsidiarity principle.
Back in July, a number of you already asked the Council - through myself as its personal representative - various questions about these constitutional aspects, and I responded to you at the time. In my response, not only did I officially refer to the preparation of the future IGC, but also to the presidency' s report to the European Council of Gothenburg, in which numerous initiatives are mentioned that are taking place in the Member States in which various regional entities were involved, as well as events that are organised within the framework of the debate in the Committee of the Regions on this issue.
The presidency has now read the resolution on the strengthening of the roles of the regions within the European Union with great interest. The resolution was adopted in LiÃšge on 15 November by the Conference of Presidents of the regions with legislative powers, as they will be referred to henceforth.
The Committee of the Regions' opinion which pertains to the participation of that Committee to the future Convention is now also known.
However, no decision has been taken on the issues regarding the organisation of the debate and the topics which need to be discussed.
As I have already said, these are matters to be dealt with by the European Council of Laeken.
Speaking for myself, I should like to add that I am very keen to find out when the debate within the Committee of the Regions will be opened, for this is an issue that is being avoided at all costs by those involved.
Outside the Committee, a number of its members complain about the fact that surely, a distinction should be drawn between those who have this legislative power and those who have not.
The Committee itself is keeping tight-lipped.
I have to say, I have some qualms on the matter.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, you will understand, of course, that those posing questions have scheduled this Question Time at a very strategic moment, namely a few hours, a few days away from the Council of Laeken.
We would be delighted if you were to give us an idea of what will be discussed at that Council.
Prime Minister Verhofstadt has toured the capital cities and paid a visit to Madrid yesterday.
Madrid is a difficult customer in this regional issue.
The Spanish Government has more or less made the fight against terrorism its number one priority.
In Spain, defending the rights, the real rights of nations and regions is often considered as terrorism or part of terrorism, and this is of course unacceptable. This is not a European stance that we can accept.
I would very specifically like to ask you whether the difficulties which the Spanish very often cause with regard to the representation in the Committee of the Regions have meanwhile been resolved and secondly, and whether they will indeed not be opposed to the concept of 'constitutional region' being mentioned in the Declaration of Laeken.
I would be very obliged if you would look into this.
Honourable Members, I cannot answer that question for the very simple reason that I do not know the answer.
Since I did not have the opportunity of accompanying the Prime Minister to Madrid, I do not know exactly what was discussed. Consequently, I am unable to answer your question in the light of this lack of knowledge.
I am sorry, I do not know.
I am certain that the topic has been discussed, but I am ignorant of the content of the discussion.
I was not there and I have not had the time to find out. I apologise.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would lend you my mobile, but unfortunately, it is broken.
I wanted to ask you what place the regions will occupy within the framework of the Convention.
I know there are certain things to which you do not know the answer, but we would be very interested to find out whether the regions will actually have the role that was assigned for them by the Belgian Presidency.
We hope that you have been able to adhere to that position after that tour of the various capital cities.
With regard to your own challenging question about your opinion on the Committee of the Regions, I would like to state that, as you know, the constitutional regions are very much in the minority in the Committee of the Regions, and it is of course unnecessary to stage one' s own defeats.
The Committee of the Regions was composed in such a way as to ensure that the constitutional regions would form a minority, and I would want them to be considered as federal states that, in the course of history, have never been given the chance to develop into Member States.
If you allow me, I would also point out that there will be a number of small states that will soon be joining, including Malta, Cyprus, Slovakia, etc.
You will understand that the constitutional regions would feel cheated if they were not to have any rights at all in this company.
I should like to say to Mrs Maes that she is fully aware of the dangers of swapping mobiles and subsequently leaving them switched on, but this is a Belgian inside joke, Mr President, which all fellow countrymen will be able to enjoy to the full, and this is why it is best if we did not.
This was the first point I wanted to make.
Secondly, I have never been aware of the fact that being in a minority is a reason not to engage in a certain fight which is deemed justified.
The times may have changed, but we used to think differently about this.
It is, of course, true that the regions with legislative powers are in the minority in the Committee of the Regions, but I would question whether this was done on purpose.
I do not believe so, but this is a matter of opinion.
I can only note that the discussion on this point is far more heated outside the Committee than it is inside.
This is my observation, and maybe this may change one day, but not in the foreseeable future.
I have my own thoughts about a fight which is not even fought at the right forum, but this is my personal opinion.
Mrs Maes, I have read the text, the appeal to the Belgian Presidency which was published either yesterday or the day before.
I cannot share the opinion that regions are a kind of Member State, as it were, but which, by a stroke of really bad luck, ended up not being Member States.
This is a reasoning which could, of course, be taken to extremes, bordering the absurd.
The reply I received from a State Minister of the Indian State of Andarpradesh to my question how many people lived in that province, will always stay with me.
He said 79 million.
79 million for Andarpradesh, just imagine. This compares to a large Member State in Europe.
But this is not how things work, evidently.
It is the statute according to public and international law of an entity that determines the position of this entity in the hierarchy.
Belgium has found a solution with which you are familiar.
I also believe that we are perfectly entitled to propagate this solution or to publicise it to the others, which is what Belgium did.
It is therefore also the other Member States which, if necessary, should do this for their own delegations and should not expect the Union to solve the problem which they have, as yet, been unable to solve within their own borders, but, honourable Members, this is a strictly personal opinion.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, today, we want to strengthen the new, not only economic, but political and social, identity of Europe.
I think that in order to do this we need to find a new internal structure that is suited to the reality of our diversity.
Our present reality is not, however, simply shaped by the Member States alone, but there is a greater diversity and richness, represented culturally and socially by the historic peoples and nations of Europe and, politically, by the federated States, constitutional regions and autonomous communities, in particular, and also, of course, on another level, by the purely administrative regions, the provinces and the local authorities.
Do you not think, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that, by virtue of the mandate laid down in the Treaty of Nice, that in the Laeken Declaration, this question of European diversity, of the different cultural, social and political realities, should be specifically included as an important part of the debate to take place during the years 2002 and 2003 on the future of the Union and the division of competences between the institutions, in order to seek and find the best possible structure, which will allow us to share, without tension or conflict, the various, necessary levels of competence and sovereignty in existence in Europe?
Mr President, in response to the remarks that have just been made, I think it is important to bear the nature of the issue in mind.
On the one hand, we have the cultural, linguistic and other diversities which constitute one of the greatest resources of the European Union and of Europe in general. I am aware that these diversities are presented as one of the European Union' s most important assets in the present version of the text.
This poses no problem.
On the other hand, we have the question of whether we should depart from what, to date, has been current European Union practice. The various institutions of the European Union do not concern themselves in assessing the constitutional arrangements of Member States, providing of course that these arrangements are compatible with fundamental principles, such as human rights and the protection of minorities and so on.
This is our ongoing policy.
I think that we should not confuse respect for diversities with a departure of this nature. In essence, this would involve breaking a long tradition.
I regard this as a wise tradition, although this is merely my personal opinion.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, it does seem that Belgium has found an institutional solution to its diversity.
It is a solution that you are pleased with and I welcome this.
For those who are not directly involved, Belgium' s constitutional structure is of a complexity that pays tribute to the ingenuity of your public law specialists, but it is a solution which I would describe as bespoke.
As you know, I support independence for Catalonia and I do not think this is a viable solution for Catalonia, for instance, within the Spanish State.
The question I have, therefore, is very simple.
Constitutional regions aside, although I recognise that these present some difficulties, could we not include, in the future European constitution, a right that, in my view, is elementary, which is the right to self-determination.
Do the Catalan people not have the right to self-determination, will they not have the right, one day, to their own State within the European Union?
Given that Slovenia will soon be a member of the EU, why should Catalonia not be a member as well?
I repeat, that is not the question.
The Member States belong at a specific level in the hierarchy of political entities of public administrative law and international law.
This is a factual reality that you can - and that is another debate - desire to change, you are entitled to do this.
I think that it is too early to say what the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will do.
The IGC, as you know, will work on the basis of a mandate which is due to be drawn up and approved by all the European institutions.
In any case, it will certainly not turn out to be a repeat of the Congress of Vienna or the Congress of Versailles, but I could of course be mistaken.
Without giving my personal opinion which, as President, I should not do, I would like to support the President-in-Office of the Council in her opinion that the questions are not following any kind of logical order.
The questions we are dealing with are on the subject of the Laeken European Council and the current European Union, however interesting the proposals made by some Members of this House may be.
I now give the floor to Mr MacCormick for a supplementary question.
I wonder whether I might say with real sincerity what a pleasure it is to take part in Question Time when Mrs Neyts is with us because she really does make an effort to answer the question fully and faithfully. That is genuinely appreciated.
I hope you will pass this message to your Prime Minister and try to ensure, when the Council meets next week, that it really does address itself to the issue of democracy in Europe.
We face a crisis of democracy in the Union and it will become in some ways yet more acute as the Union enlarges.
If people in the regions and localities of Europe feel that their democracy means nothing, because all decisions are taken in remote places; if they are always merely told 'look to the constitution of your Member State if you are not happy with things', that will damage democracy in Europe, not help it.
I therefore ask you most sincerely to try to ensure that the type of issue which my colleagues and I have been putting to you this evening is really thought about at Laeken.
I would like to thank Mr MacCormick for his kind words.
As this is my last Question Time, you must forgive me if my answers to your various questions are slightly too long.
The Belgian Prime Minister is familiar with the issue and he has his own views on the matter.
But in his capacity as President of the European Council he also knows that he will need unanimity in order to have the declaration approved.
Whatever his personal feelings might or will be, he will need a consensus.
We will have to see how far we can go.
That is all I can commit him and myself to.
I just wanted to point out, Mr President, that my surname was misspelled.
It has now disappeared from the board and I hope it will not be misspelled in the Minutes of the sitting as well.
Mr President, on a point of order, it does not seem fair to me that, if any Member is entitled to ask a supplementary question after his initial question, the four of us are only allowed to ask one joint supplementary question.
I do not think that this is what is laid down in the Rules of Procedure.
No, I allowed supplementary questions to be asked by Members other than those who had originally asked questions, as stated in the Rules of Procedure.
We can read it together afterwards. Then we will see that we are in agreement on this matter.
This is a joint answer.
As you already know, if we were to allow four questions with small differences between them, it would take up the whole of question time.
Mr President, I have a supplementary question along the same lines and I would ask the Minister if she would be prepared to reply to it.
It follows on from some of the comments and questions that have been asked already.
I come from Wales, a nation with four times the population of Luxembourg, which is of course a EU Member State.
Now in its November resolution on governance, Parliament stated categorically that it will welcome proposals from the Convention to redraft Article 5 of the EC Treaty to include a specific reference to the function of constitutional regions within Member States.
This repeated a resolution of the previous October which stated that the Treaties should be amended specifically to recognise and respect the political and legislative powers of the internal nations and regions.
Is the Council aware of these resolutions and if not, will it seek to ensure that attention is drawn to them during its deliberations at Laeken?
I have answered your various questions at length as much as I can.
The degree of awareness of Parliament resolutions, which are many and manifold as you know, is directly related to people's interest in the issue concerned.
Therefore, those who are very interested in federalism, in the internal organisation of states, in the most effective and the most equitable distribution of powers, certainly are aware of these views.
Those who are less interested in the issues are probably less aware of the existence of these resolutions.
It seems to me that it is Parliament's task and responsibility to make other people aware of the resolutions it has voted, so I invite you to do just that.
Question No 5 by (H-0865/01):
Subject: Demand for drugs to fight anthrax The anthrax crisis in the USA has produced a rise in demand for Cipro, a patented drug manufactured by Bayer.
The Canadian Government's response was simply to ask the country's industry to produce 'copies' of the drug.
The US Administration appears to be pondering the same course of action as US legislation apparently allows the Administration, when there is a need for a patented drug, to ignore the restrictions imposed by the patent and authorise its manufacture.
Evidently double standards are operating in regard to the developing countries' request for a reduction in the price of patented drugs and a relaxation of the legislation protecting patents in order to treat AIDS and other diseases.
Has the Council considered what action it would take in the event of a rise in demand for a particular drug, as has occurred in the USA?
Is it consistent with Community law for a Member State to have US-type legislation which allows it to ignore the restrictions imposed by patents?
Will it respond positively to the developing countries' request for a price reduction and a relaxation of patent rights, which would clearly be beneficial not only for the developing countries but also for European and American consumers?
In response to Mr Alavanos, I would say that the Council is perfectly aware of the importance of the issue that he raised.
I would also reiterate that Article 152 - formerly article 129 of the Treaty establishing the European Community - specifies, in general terms, that Community action in the area of health shall supplement national policies.
The Community shall encourage cooperation between the Member States in the areas mentioned in the Treaty and, if necessary, shall lend support to their action.
In this context, the Community shall also ensure a high level of human health protection by defining and implementing all the policies and actions.
As you know, the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference, which took place in Doha between 9 to 14 November this year, adopted a Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health.
In the Declaration, the ministerial conference acknowledged, on the one hand, the gravity of public health problems, particularly afflicting many developing countries and least-developed countries and, on the other hand, that intellectual property protection is also important for the development of new medicines.
In this Declaration, WTO members agreed that the TRIPS agreement does not prevent Members from taking the appropriate measures to protect public health and affirmed that the Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members' right to protect public health, and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all.
More specifically, the Declaration recognises that the flexibilities in the TRIPS agreement include the right of each Member to grant compulsory licences and to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, it being understood that public health crises, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics, can represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency.
Furthermore, the Declaration reaffirms the commitment of developed-country WTO Members to provide incentives to their enterprises and institutions to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-developed countries.
The Declaration also specifies that the least-developed country Members will not be obliged, with respect to pharmaceutical products, to apply Sections 5 (Trademarks) and 7 (Protection of non-divulged information) of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement or to enforce rights provided for under these Sections until 1 January 2016, without prejudice to the right of the least-developed country Members to seek other extensions of the transition periods.
I would add that, in the Declaration, WTO Member States made a commitment to propose, before July 2002, genuine solutions that could be consolidated in order to resolve the problem of those developing countries and least-developed countries that do not have manufacturing capacities for medicines.
There is the problem of possible parallel imports or other measures which must enable these countries to have access to these medicines at a price that is reasonable, and the lowest possible.
This will be done between now and next summer and I assure you that we will have to work like Trojans to achieve this.
Time is not on our side.
The problem is extremely complex, but this is a very important commitment, because it relates to an aspect of the problem which could not be dealt with by the agreement.
I thank the President-in-Office both for her detailed reply and her cooperation over the past six months.
Good cooperation is sometimes marked by a degree of tension.
Thank you very much, it is just that I need to study your reply.
I should like to ask a supplementary question, now that Nigeria has just starting producing AIDS drugs which are, however, old generation drugs of very dubious effectiveness.
You referred in your reply to the transfer of more modern technology for use in particular by the countries of Africa which have been struck by mass epidemics; how can we achieve this?
I have mentioned a few of the things that will make it possible to get access to cheap medicines: compulsory licensing, cooperation with the big pharmaceutical firms - you are aware that the World Health Organisation is working on that and has already devised a number of mechanisms - and cooperation with organisations such as MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃšres that are also active in this field.
Finally, if an agreement can be reached next summer, we will find ways of importing those medicines into countries that do not have the possibility of producing them themselves.
Question No 6 by (H-0869/01):
Subject: Attention paid by the Council to the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament concerning the conflict in Western Sahara and assessment of the visit by the King of Morocco to that territory On 25 October 2001, Parliament' s plenary tabled an amendment to its resolution on the progress achieved in the implementation of the CFSP, as a result of which paragraph 33 of that resolution now reads: 'insists, furthermore, that the European Union should cooperate actively in settling the conflict in Western Sahara in accordance with the United Nations resolutions, along the lines requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of 16 March 2000 and the Statement by the German presidency of the Council of June 1999' .
In what way is the Council planning to take what Parliament has called for into consideration?
Will it finally combine forces in order to participate in the speedy, accurate implementation of the UN Peace Plan for Western Sahara (which provides for the holding of a referendum on self-determination), as called for in paragraph 6 of Parliament' s March 2000 resolution?
Does it believe that such joint action would enable the positions of its members - particularly Spain and France - to be coordinated in support of the UN Peace Plan?
In this connection, what view does it take of the visit by the King of Morocco to Western Sahara, which was strongly criticised by the Polisario Front?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the part-session of 19 and 20 September, the Council took note of the European Parliament resolution on the progress made on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy, and agreed to consider this resolution within the framework of the discussion of the different points it contains.
As was also stated at the time, the Council is delighted with the efforts the European Parliament has made to reach a sustainable solution which is acceptable to all parties involved in the conflict in the Western Sahara. This solution forms a crucial goal for the stability and welfare in that region.
The Council fully and actively supports the process which is now taking place within the framework of the United Nations, as formulated in the resolutions of the Security Council, particularly the efforts made by Mr James Baker.
In Resolution No 1359 of 29 June, the Security Council clearly marked the path to be followed.
In this connection, the extension of the mandate of the MINURSO was significant, because this has made it possible to continue the present consultation among the parties, under the auspices of Mr Baker.
The presidency is in contact with Mr Baker.
The leading role in this process is being played by the United Nations.
In this connection, the Council is prepared to mediate in order to create a climate of trust among the parties and hence to facilitate a sustainable solution, but it does not intend to take the place of the United Nations.
The Council is acutely aware of the great sensitivity surrounding this dossier and of the need for observing strict neutrality. This is to avoid the Council being used by one of the parties involved as an instrument, which would only have a negative impact on the search for a solution, as well as on the role of the European Union in that region.
Moreover, the Council is urging the parties to take a number of urgent, humanitarian measures, such as permitting family visits and liberating political prisoners.
Whichever solution is opted for, it will have to be founded on broad compliance with democratic principles and respect for human rights, including the disquieting issue of refugees, but also of Moroccan prisoners, notably when these people need urgent care, in general, and medical care, in particular.
In addition, I should like to emphasise that here too, the European Union is by far the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the refugees from the Western Sahara.
Since 1996, the Commission has set aside EUR 56 million for this cause.
The visit by King Mohammed VI to the Western Sahara has not impacted on the above-mentioned approach in any way.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, what an interesting answer.
This may be the first time that this House has heard a political statement from the Council which goes much further than the usual strictly formal statements on the conflict in the Western Sahara.
This answer with real content is very welcome.
But I have to tell you the following: having listened to this response, I am under the legitimate impression that in the Council too much weight may be given to a view of the conflict in the Western Sahara that does not consider that the solution to it may only be based on compliance with the United Nations Settlement Plan, which includes holding a referendum on the self-determination of the Sahrawi people, a referendum that has been blocked for many years by one of the parties concerned, Morocco.
You talked about many things: for example, the latest Security Council resolution, but at no time did you refer to the United Nations peace plan. Neither did you refer to the referendum and, also, you have insisted too much on some aspects, whilst forgetting others, for example the violation of human rights in the occupied territories of the Western Sahara.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in July this year, at the start of the Belgian Presidency, I submitted a question to the Council, to be answered in writing, on statements made by Mr Javier Solana, the person responsible for foreign and security policy in the European Union, in relation to the United Nations Peace Plan, the future of the Western Sahara and the referendum.
Now, in December, with the Belgian Presidency about to draw to a close, I am still waiting to receive an official answer from the Council.
Although it is public knowledge and a well-known fact, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that an official answer was circulated in the United Nations in the month of October - which was even the cause of a diplomatic incident between various representatives of the Member States - the question I am asking is this: when can I have my answer?
Please, before you leave us, can you give me this political Christmas present.
The Honourable Member appears to be extremely well informed, which is his right, if not his duty.
The same is not true of us, as we are still trying to find your question; I have no doubt that we received it, but we cannot find any trace of the letter. So, if you can help us to find it, we will do our best to provide an answer for you before the end of the year.
I apologise for this oversight and for our negligence because, of course, these are the only reasons I can give to explain this.
Thank you.
We would urge the President-in-Office of the Council to look for this missing question, because the question and the answer have been widely reported in the press, at least in the Spanish press.
Mr President, we are probably addressing the question or the comment to the wrong person, but here you represent the Council as a whole.
I have a feeling that the Western Sahara issue, to which I have devoted over half my political life so far, is actually a tragedy.
How the conflict should be resolved is clear - after all, the UN peace plan was there at the beginning of the 1990s - and it is equally clear which European countries have very strong geopolitical interests in its not being adhered to.
I must of course take note of the response that what is done in the UN must be adhered to.
I believe, though, that the European Union and the Member States must, for the sake of a common foreign and security policy, choose a coordinated way of proceeding, one that is in accordance with the UN peace plan.
Following the visit of King Mohammed VI, events have followed in rapid succession.
There has also been a visit to the Western Sahara by the French President, Jacques Chirac, who, in defiance of all international legal positions, said that the Western Sahara was made up of the southern provinces of Morocco - a point we are discussing in the Council of the European Union.
Mr President, the Honourable Member must understand that it is impossible for me to answer such detailed questions.
Mrs Scheele, I have outlined to you what the Council' s position is and what the discussions might have related to. That is the Council' s position and the Council' s answer.
Question No 7 by (H-0874/01):
Subject: Minorities in the Republika Srpska What measures have been taken to make return and reconstruction possible for repressed and exiled minorities - above all Croats and Muslims - in the Bosnian mini-state Republika Srpska?
Is the EU supporting the Catholic bishop Franjo Komarica of Banja Luka in his social work and his promotion of understanding between peoples?
The Council has already drawn the Honourable Member' s attention, in its answer to oral question H-0689 during the October session, to the fact that the return of displaced people was part of a whole raft of conditions imposed by the European Union as part of the stabilisation and association process, and the countries of the region subscribed to these conditions at the Zagreb Summit.
The Council's report assessing the progress achieved by the countries of the region towards the conditions for European integration, which was approved on 11 June 2001, stated that the process of the return of refugees and displaced persons to Bosnia-Herzegovina should be speeded up and that the measures to create the proper conditions to enable people to return under the correct circumstances, in accordance with the Dayton-Paris agreement, should be strengthened.
It is, first and foremost, the responsibility of the local and national authorities to take the necessary measures.
The European Union will certainly use the monitoring process to follow this issue and, where applicable, to assess whether, on the one hand, the progress made in respecting the conditions and, on the other hand, the level of relations established and the level of technical and economic assistance are still appropriate.
The 1995 Dayton-Paris Peace agreement, which brought an end to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, established the post of High Representative who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of this agreement, amongst other things.
The current post-holder, Mr Wolfgang Petric, has not previously hesitated to dismiss local leaders from their duties when it turned out that these leaders were opposed to implementing the peace agreement, including Annex VII, which provides for the return of refugees and displaced persons.
He did so in accordance with the powers granted him by the Ministerial Conference of the Council implementing the Bonn peace accord in December 1997.
On several occasions, the Council strongly supported the efforts made by Mr Petric to fulfil his mandate.
Regarding the material support that the European Union is providing to assist the return and resettlement of these people, this question is primarily a matter for the Commission, which manages Community assistance.
However, the Council understands that, since 1998, in line with the recommendations of the High Representative' s Office and the Return and Reconstruction working group, increasing funds have been granted to support the return of minority groups to Republika Srpska.
This area should also continue to occupy its rightful and important position within the framework of Community assistance provided under the CARDS 2000-2006 programme, Article 2 of which explicitly mentions aid for the return of refugees and displaced persons.
I can assure you, as we near the end of six months of holding the presidency, that the Council and its various members attach extreme importance to the issue of the return and reintegration of refugees in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in other areas of the Balkans where this issue unfortunately persists.
The tense situation appears to be gradually easing and the number of people returning to and resettling in the area will increase. Of course, the same amount will not return to each area, but there is no escaping the fact that numbers are on the increase.
We shall continue to attach great importance to this issue and this item is on the agenda of all the meetings where it can be discussed.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for this detailed answer and also for your intensive involvement in this area.
I would just like to put two specific questions.
First: Is it possible for the Council to try and find a precise figure for the number of refugees and expellees who have to date returned to the Republika Srpska?
There were agreements about this, which can in fact only be monitored by finding out exactly how many people have gone back.
I would ask you, if you are unable to do that today, to perhaps let me have that information in writing.
My second point relates to tangible aid for the minorities.
I have heard that, especially in the Banja Luka region, the Catholic Church is intensively engaging in care for the sick across cultural boundaries and in many activities in the spheres of social welfare and agriculture, and that funds promised for these have simply not been granted.
That is the second question I am putting, and I am keen to learn whether you know anything about this.
In response to the Honourable Member' s first question, I can only say that I do not at the moment have the exact figures to hand; we are finding them out and they will be communicated to you.
As far as the second question is concerned, I believe that this is more a question for the Commission, which is responsible for the specific implementation of all forms of humanitarian aid, urgent or otherwise.
As you are aware, I believe, it is the Commission that manages these very specific dossiers and I think that it is the Commission to which this question should be addressed.
Question No 8 by (H-0876/01):
Subject: EU and international measures providing for the return of illegally transferred assets Under the terms of the Tampere Council conclusions the Member States committed themselves to taking concrete steps to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime.
Member States were urged also to implement fully the provisions of the Money Laundering Directive (which includes the conversion or transfer of property and the identification of the customers of credit and financial institutions), the 1990 Strasbourg Convention and the Financial Task Force recommendations.
They were also urged to adopt the revised directive on money laundering which is now under conciliation.
The Council called for the competences of Europol to be extended to money laundering in general and for common standards to be developed to prevent the use of corporations or entities registered outside the jurisdiction of the EU in the hiding of criminal proceeds and money laundering.
EU States have signed the UN Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime which commits governments to adopt within their domestic legal systems the measures necessary to enable the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.
Does the Council consider that the above EU, UN and Council of Europe measures and strategies confirm that the European Union does have a legitimate interest in relation to money illegally transferred by former dictators, i.e..
Nigeria, and will the Council now undertake to ensure that these monies in banks throughout the EU are returned to the democratically elected Government of Nigeria?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as is evident from the question, the European Community and the Union have already taken a number of measures and others are in the pipeline, notably within the framework of the fight against financial crime.
The specific aim of these measures is to combat the laundering of money and to seize the proceeds of crime.
Since the events of 11 September, a special effort has been made in the fight against funding terrorism.
Alongside this, there are a multitude of other instruments, including the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of 1959 and the EU Convention of 2000 on the same topic.
Both treaties contain a number of general regulations in the field of cooperation among states and this package of instruments also undoubtedly contributes to the fight against financial crime.
Furthermore, reference can be made to a number of instruments in the field of substantive law, such as, for example, the framework decision on the fight against forgery.
On 16 October of this year, the Council convened in a joint formation of Ecofin and Justice and Social Affairs.
On that occasion, the Council laid down the decision to adopt a protocol as part of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union.
This protocol considerably improves cooperation among the Member States in the fight against economic and financial crime and, in particular, the fight against money laundering, corruption and forgery, and it provides for broad agreement concerning the dissemination of information concerning financial transactions, accounts and bank details.
The Member States have committed themselves to ratifying this protocol by the end of next year at the latest.
I cannot answer the specific question concerning the repatriation of capital illegally transferred to banks of the Union by former dictators, since this question falls outside the scope of the Council, as the honourable Member was notified in the first part-session of October 2001, in answer to an identical question he then posed to the Council.
Thank you, President-in-Office, for your comprehensive reply to the first part of my question.
Yet again, however, you fail or you are unwilling to understand the thrust of the latter part of my question. It suggests that there are vast amounts of money removed from places such as Nigeria and the Congo and now in European banks which many people over the years have tried to find a means of returning to the people of Nigeria and the Congo without success.
What I am suggesting is that you, as President-in-Office of the Council, have a responsibility, under the various conventions I refer to, to ensure that these monies are returned to the various former colonies.
Surely you now understand fully the meaning of my question and will reply to it and ensure that these monies, which were illegally removed by dictators and terrorists, are returned to the people in the various former colonies?
I can only repeat the same answer.
For the time being, the Council has no instrument which would enable it to do what you want it to do.
It might be that, in future, such an instrument will be developed and improved, but for now, this is not the case.
In the absence of such an instrument, action by the Council is not possible.
Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, corruption is an issue of significance in some countries desirous of joining the EU, and we are currently engaging in accession negotiations with them.
Funds gained by privatisation have often disappeared from these countries in a questionable manner.
Do you believe it would be possible to resolve these issues within the framework of accession negotiations, or at least to apply unambiguous legal provisions in this area?
My response to the honourable Member is that, during the negotiations with the candidate countries, the quality of the constitutional state is an important element. We therefore examine whether the mechanisms which ensure that a state can be considered a constitutional state are in place, or not, as the case may be, and close attention is also paid to the quality of the judiciary.
For example, individual reports on the situation in a candidate country may state that, so far, judges receive inadequate training and are not paid enough and that this inevitably encourages inadmissible practices and such like.
So in that sense, yes, Mr RÃŒbig, in terms of achieving maximum transparency and consistent jurisdiction and ensuring that there are bodies to which one can appeal when one deems oneself to be treated badly, and so on, in that sense, yes, I do believe it is possible. However, in the sense of delving deep into individual cases, I do not believe it to be possible.
Question No 9 by (H-0879/01)
Subject: The case of Tracey Housel, a British national on death row in Georgia, USA Is the Council aware of the plight of Tracey Housel, a British national on death row in Georgia, USA?
Is the Council concerned that Mr Housel may not have received a fair trial that accords with the standards of international human rights law?
What steps will the Council take to assist Mr Housel?
The European Union believes that the death penalty, which is, of course, irreversible, is a particularly inhumane punishment.
The EU is therefore opposed to the death penalty in all cases and it has agreed to work towards its universal abolition.
The EU is concerned that approximately 90 States keep this punishment, although only a minority - thirty countries or so, one of which is the United States - continues to carry out executions every year.
In 1998, as part of its objective to universally abolish the death penalty, the European Union drew up a series of guidelines to specify the circumstances in which it should undertake specific and targeted actions.
In countries where the death penalty still exists, the Union is working to progressively limit its application and insists that the punishment be carried out whilst observing specific minimum standards.
I know that this is only partly limiting the unbearable awfulness of the act, but, even in such horrible circumstances, this is how things must be done...
The European Union is closely monitoring the situation in the United States, where numerous executions take place.
In 2001, steps were taken to help a number of people on death row, in line with the European Union' s guidelines, in Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas.
In addition, in the autumn of 2000, the Union decided, for the first time, to intervene as amicus curiae in a trial before the Supreme Federal Court involving a condemned man, in order to raise before the Court the issue of the legality in international law of the sentencing to death of a person who was a minor at the time of the events. The Presidency-in-Office of the Union submitted another request to intervene as amicus curiae for Alexander Williams, who was condemned to death for a crime that he committed when he was under 18 years of age.
The matter is still before the Supreme Court of Georgia. In another case - Atkins v Virginia - the European Union intends to make another request to intervene as amicus curiae before the Supreme Court in order to reaffirm its position on the application of the death penalty to people suffering from mental illness.
The Council is aware of the details of the Housel affair and, in particular, of the fact that a judgement by the Supreme Court of the United States could be handed down before the end of the year.
We would like to emphasise that, for those facing the death penalty who are nationals of a Member State, the European Union acts at the request of that Member State, which is best placed to judge whether it is appropriate for the Community to intervene.
At this stage, the Council has not yet received a request from the United Kingdom to assist Mr Housel.
The Council was informed that the United Kingdom is very actively monitoring this matter, in conjunction with Mr Housel' s lawyers.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for that very detailed reply.
I have no supplementary, but I would urge the Council to continue that attitude to the plight of EU citizens because many Members of this House may have constituents who have received what is clearly an unfair trial.
This is something that is on the increase.
I believe that, as well as the Member State intervening on behalf of these EU citizens, the Council also has a clear role.
I fully expect the UK Government to make representations to the Council in what I believe in this case is an example of an unfair trial leading to an irreversible death penalty.
On a point of order, I would like to point out that, with the exception of the last speaker, not one of our colleagues has respected their speaking time.
The result is that we have dealt with only nine questions, the first four of which had a joint answer.
I completely agree, Mr Zacharakis, but you will understand that it is not appropriate to suddenly take the microphone away from Members.
As a Member of this House you will understand why we need to call upon the solidarity and the common sense of all Members.
I pay very close attention to the comments made out loud.
I think we should all give thanks to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck for the extraordinary degree of cooperation she has shown over these last six months.
I am sure that her former position as a Member of this House has increased her sensitivity in this regard, including her willingness to answer Members' questions.
Thank you very much.
As the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 10 to 38 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes Questions to the Commission.
Conflict prevention
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0394/2001) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the Commission communication on Conflict Prevention (COM(2001) 211 - C5-0458/2001 - 2001/2182(COS)).
I now give the floor to Mr Lagendijk.
Mr President, over the past few years, conflict prevention has developed into a real 'feel-good' concept, to use a traditional Dutch phrase.
Everyone is in favour of conflict prevention. Why not?
There is always something that can be done with it, and why should it not be included in a list of measures?
In that way, conflict prevention slowly developed from a priority of and for pacifists, via a kind of interesting subsidiary activity alongside military activities, to what I would call one the European Union' s central ambitions, currently recognised by many.
It is no longer a plaything of one group, it has become the central pursuit of the European Union as a whole, and this is also the reason why the time has come to translate much of what has been written to date about conflict prevention - stunning reports have been published over the past few years, also by the European Commission, for which congratulations are due - into practice.
Fortunately, we do not need to start from scratch, for notably experience in the Balkans over the past ten years has taught us what the European Union is capable of, and has already done, in the field of conflict prevention.
As you may know, I am also rapporteur for the Stability Pact, which I always extol as the greatest conflict prevention project.
I am really convinced that the coherence in this programme between democracy, economic development and security is an illustration of how conflict prevention has developed from a concept on paper to a very usable instrument in practice.
In my report, I have outlined three points, and today, I should like to do this again.
Maybe the most straight-forward point, yet very tricky in practice, is the cooperation between the European Union and the OSCE.
Everyone says that this should be done, that it is positive that it happens, and it is already happening.
In a high number of locations, cooperation with the OSCE is good, but all too often, I visit places where this cooperation is faltering.
I visited Macedonia recently, with a few fellow MEPs, where the European Union has an observation mission, but so has the OSCE. Cooperation between the two is not really ideal, to put it mildly.
A week ago in Bucharest, the Commissioner made a number of sound proposals for cooperation between the EU and the OSCE, for example in the southern Caucasus and in Central Asia. In my opinion, it would be good if in future, the Commission could possibly monitor cooperation with the OSCE more effectively than it is doing now.
The OSCE often has the same mission and is often active in the same field. This applies to each campaign - including the Balkans, where, once again, things often go well but all too often they do not - in order to better implement this cooperation and this distribution of tasks.
A second point in my report is the European Civil Peace Corps.
Once again, one could state with a certain degree of self-mockery that it has developed from a fun plaything of the Greens to a crucial instrument in the EU' s toolbox.
I would therefore call on the Commission not simply to be grateful to Parliament for the concept of the Civil Peace Corps, as it did five or six years ago, and do nothing else with the idea, but instead to seize the opportunities now, which I am convinced are presenting themselves, to develop this European Peace Corps and to turn it into a central point of EU policy.
This is possible, not only because I, or Parliament, welcome it, but also because in the meantime, experience has been gathered with civil peace observers.
The European Union has an observation corps and has observation missions in several places worldwide.
Germany and Sweden have experience of training civil observers, and I believe that the time has come for the Commission, for the European Union, to better coordinate and pool this expertise and these people, so that in future, the European Union is not only able to act rapidly at military level, but also when it comes to sending civil observers.
Finally, I have come to the third point, which may well be the most sweeping in my report.
I would positively welcome it if conflict prevention were to be removed from the remit of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
What do I mean by this?
It is no longer acceptable for us to talk about some or other EU policy, for example in the field of agriculture or trade, of which we are of the view that it should serve, for example, to better develop Africa' s economy, while at the same time continue to apply components of that policy - and I would cite the well-known export subsidies - of which we know that locally, in Africa for example, they do not have a stabilising effect. If anything, they mess up the economic structure or hamper its development.
I would prefer it if in future, conflict prevention, like human rights and the environment, were to become a goal of all EU policy, not only in the external policy area, but also in the area of trade and agriculture, for example.
If that is possible, if it is possible to make conflict prevention a central point in all areas of EU policy, then I will be happy, and what I refer to as a hobbyhorse of the 'soft' forces will then have developed into the favourite subject of the hard core of the EU' s policy abroad and all over the world.
Mr President, I should like to concur with the observations made a moment ago by the central proponent of conflict prevention, Mr Lagendijk.
I very often share his views in areas of this kind, for indeed - and we should credit him for this - particularly the green sector has very often put forward the idea of conflict prevention by non-military means with great clarity.
One could also say that this is very topical in this day and age.
The European Union is weak as far as its military contribution to international security and national law and order in countries surrounding us are concerned.
This was clear from the difficulties in setting up this rapid reaction force.
We got off to a good start, but it is often still in doubt, maybe with good reason, whether this will lead to early results.
All the more opportunities present themselves to the Union in terms of non-military means.
And it appears to me that this also falls more within the competences of the Commission.
We have competences in this area.
That is why the civil instrument is gaining in importance, notably for the European Union, in the light of the Union' s military weakness and of the topicality of the civil means in controlling and preventing conflicts alike.
The cold war is over and the entire security context has changed.
Large-scale threats have given way to smaller, sometimes persistent, wars with ideological, Mafia-related and ethnic facets.
The flaring up of such conflicts can be prevented very effectively by civil means, certainly when these conflicts recur.
This explains the flurry of activity which is also especially being generated by the European Union at the moment in areas of tension or precisely where tension has been averted.
Situations of lawlessness require a completely different approach and involve the police, government officials, aid organisations, technicians, observers, economists and people who know how the civil society develops.
In other words, these situations require a comprehensive approach.
I therefore agree with the provoking statement "It should be removed from the remit of foreign affairs" .
As far as I am concerned, this means that it requires a comprehensive approach from society.
This is what matters in conflict control, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy will probably continue to play an important role, but so will other sections of this Parliament.
Indeed, a country' s development as a whole also very much relies on averting violent conflict.
And I have to say that Mr Lagendijk has listed the options very eloquently.
He is right in saying that we, for example, should not simply accept the existence of this two-pillar structure, that we should put them back on the agenda and that there should be a budget for the things we intend to do in this field.
In my view, the unity of the European Union, particularly in this field, is a direct security interest.
We must speak with one voice, even in this field of conflict prevention.
We must therefore keep our own activities as governments and as industry in our countries well under control.
I appreciate the rapporteur' s preference for a peace corps, but I would like to point out that the erratum that I received, which concerns Article 17, is an erratum that is ineffective. Article 17 is still an excellent article and I said with good reason that the peace corps must be developed within the framework of the rapid reaction facility.
We have this framework, and I hope that it is maintained.
Mr President, the PSE Group sets great store by the debate on the EU' s role in the field of conflict prevention, and we greatly appreciate the efforts the European Commission has made in this connection, and also, of course, the excellent report by Mr Lagendijk.
This is an important topic, and it is certainly not only a Dutch pastime, even if we perhaps give this impression a little bit with the list of speakers, the first four of which accidentally, very accidentally, happen to hail from that country.
The European Union is the perfect organisation to play a greater role in preventing conflicts, resolving these or in the subsequent reconstruction.
The Community is the manifestation of a broad security concept based on economic and political cooperation and on shared values.
This successful model is about to be exported to Central and Eastern Europe, Cyprus, and Malta, of course.
Activities are under way in the Balkans with the same intention, and the EU is now facing the task of finding itself a useful role in the reconstruction in Afghanistan.
In my view, all these actions fall under the umbrella of conflict prevention.
Despite this, one can still claim that there is already a culture of conflict prevention within the European Union.
There is sometimes still envy with regard to NATO or the military scope of the United States, as if the European Union would need to emulate this position.
The military instrument is only one of a whole set of instruments which can be deployed to secure safety. It is used as a last resort.
The aim of conflict prevention is to prevent violence or recurrence thereof by intervening in good time, mainly by using civil instruments.
If conflict prevention is to become an effective instrument of EU security policy, it must form an integral part of our thoughts and actions.
This will force the European Union, more often than is now the case, to anticipate and trace hotbeds of conflict in good time.
It also forces the European Union to develop new instruments, such as rapid reaction facilities, and to considerably improve the three pillars.
It is easy to think of an example where an effective operation requires instruments from all three pillars.
At the moment, this is still often a bureaucratic and institutional nightmare to contend with.
The European Union acquires its strength from the multitude of instruments either available or yet to be developed, including, in a few years' time, the military instrument.
In order to deploy these effectively for the short or longer term, a kind of conflict prevention centre is needed.
What is happening where and what are we going to do about it?
But ultimately it is also about political will.
The European Union is active in many, more or less, unstable areas and regions where the level of conflict is mounting, and the European Union should visibly emphasise its conflict prevention policy, more than is now the case, and report on it regularly.
Its ambition should be to play an equally visible role as NATO but then in the field of conflict prevention and the deployment of civil instruments.
I believe that most EU citizens would be very proud of such a role.
The most important exception to general human progress is the inability to prevent violent conflicts.
Science has reached unknown heights, we are undergoing a communication revolution and erstwhile impenetrable problems can now be solved, but the world is no safer for it.
In the nineties, some five and a half million people died in 100 armed conflicts and many times more people were driven out of their homes.
In many countries, the war efforts thwart any form of economic and social development.
Since 11 September, the Americans have come to realise that our responsibility does not stop at our own borders or the countries that are of strategic importance to us.
Not only economies are interconnected worldwide, but so too is human suffering.
We are gaining an increasing insight into the deeper causes of violent conflicts; something which both the Commission and Mr Lagendijk have borne witness to.
These include the unjust distribution of welfare, religious and ethnic contrasts, a lack of democracy and bad governance.
Solving these structural problems is both crucial and difficult.
Better structures must prevent political leaders from indulging in their unbridled hunger for power and wealth undisturbed.
Time and again, it is the masses that are the victims in the struggle for power of which they themselves form no part.
For the first time, our generations experience large-scale contact between civilisations, cultures and religions, and this is bound to lead to a lack of understanding and intolerance initially.
The cause of this is that cultures and religions take their own values and standards too much for granted.
However, believers all over the world not only believe, they know for certain.
And if faith becomes an element in ones own dissatisfaction, this can easily lead to disastrous extremism.
The effective management of conflict prevention and globalisation of value systems is the greatest challenge of this time, and Europe must, in tandem with the United States - that is very important - adopt a strategy which tackles these conflicts at the root.
If the European Union wishes to strengthen its conflict-preventing role, also in the light of Cotonou, it must be adequately equipped.
Resistance in many governments to reinforcing the Commission and its delegations is pernicious for the effective implementation of European policy.
Impressive speeches this morning by the Sakharov prize-winners have allowed us to share in the immense grief and also the moral strength of these victims of senseless violence.
There is little hope as long as tolerance is regarded as treason and the eye-for-an-eye principle leads to blindness, as is the case in the Middle East and Angola.
There is only hope if we actually tackle the injustices, and if tolerance, mutual understanding and intense dialogue all over the world become the leading principles.
After the economy and science, it is now the turn of moral values to make progress.
Mr President, conflict prevention cannot consist only of rapid reaction mechanisms and contingents of police. Conflict prevention, as Jost Lagendijk has already said, means for our Group that all EU policies should be aimed at the reduction and prevention of conflict.
It means cutting agricultural export aid, opening EU markets to sensitive products, a trade policy characterised by social justice and, above all, preferential trading relationships only where respect for human rights is guaranteed.
There is no doubt in our mind that the Gothenburg Resolution marks a milestone for European foreign policy, yet, despite that, what now matters is that we should not only talk about the need for conflict prevention but also do something about it.
This means that a culture of prevention must be created in the European Union, and that it must permeate all its political dealings.
Stopping all armaments exports and supplies of small arms to potential areas of conflict will play a crucial role.
Support for human rights and sustainable development must be the core objective of European foreign policy.
Conflicts can, though, only be successfully prevented if the civil actors are involved, and so we propose the establishment of a platform for NGOs and cooperation with them. This would mean financial support for non-governmental organisations, but that would be significantly cheaper than armed conflicts.
Mr President, I would firstly like to state that the majority of Members in our Group are in favour of this excellent report by Mr Lagendijk.
However, there is an issue which affects the very essence of this report: September 11.
There is a 'before' and an 'after' September 11, which brings to light the weaknesses in this fundamentally important approach which the EU has taken towards conflict prevention.
I think that we should make it very clear that we need more information on those secret services, which, taking as an example those of the United States, have been supporting a State, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan, which have later become a public enemy of the whole world.
There is another issue of great importance, which also appears in the Lagendijk report, which has not been mentioned until now: that either the European Union chooses to give its wholehearted support to the United Nations and the efforts of the UN to use international law to resolve conflicts, or it will continue to be the world superpower, the United States, that makes the most important decisions and we Europeans will be virtually powerless, only able to put on tiny sticking plasters to cover the wounds that have been inflicted.
This is the reason why it is important that we implement what is set out in the Lagendijk report.
Another aspect I would like to mention is the importance of the economic dimension, which, there can be no doubt, is the cause of many conflicts, and we have to see this also in a global perspective.
For this reason, we have to clarify certain statements, because sometimes wide-scale liberalisation can be a greater evil than the possibility of protection.
Mr President, I should like to use this brief contribution to say a few words of appreciation for the Lagendijk report.
The rapporteur, however, is advised to prick up his ears now, for I was the only nay in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy.
Unexpected support from an opponent?
Indeed, when it comes to the substance of the report.
I appreciate Mr Lagendijk' s integral approach to conflict prevention. Not only with regard to the explicit causes of conflict, but also with regard to the hidden implications of policy that has ostensibly very little to do with conflicts.
I therefore endorse the call to the Commission to carefully study the impact of European policy on local conflicts.
However, where the tasks of the European Union in conflict prevention are concerned, I do not share the rapporteur' s view.
Recognising greater international connections, he calls for an extensive role for the EU.
I have my reservations about this.
Out of appreciation for the report and so as not the create the impression of opposing conflict prevention, I will change my vote against to an abstention.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk on his excellent report on conflict prevention, a subject on which Parliament' s position has always been very clear.
There can be no doubt that the best way to win a war is to prevent it from happening in the first place and in order to do this there is no better weapon than to be able to see it coming. That is to say, to find the underlying causes of war and to work to resolve them.
In order to do this, it is essential that we do not take a solely horizontal approach - an approach quite rightly proposed by Mr Lagendijk -, that is to say, one that includes all of the European Union' s common policies, but also a global approach, which includes the whole of society.
From this point of view non-structural methods to promote reconciliation are important, above all in those regions emerging from conflict.
Without these methods, all of the international community' s peace efforts, or those of the very local communities which the conflict has created, could come to nothing, given that the least dispute can once again light the flames of hatred that had provoked or been the cause of the conflict in the first place.
We need - and I address this particularly to the Commission - to dedicate not only more attention but, above all, more resources to education for peace programmes, along the lines of the work carried out by Mr Mayor Zaragoza when he was the Director-General of Unesco and which Kofi Annan reminded us of a few days ago.
On the other hand, if control of the arms trade is very important, then so is the traffic in diamonds and raw materials.
In this respect, I would also ask the Commission to tell us which methods it intends to adopt in order to improve, and make more efficient, the code of conduct with regard to the control of the trafficking in diamonds, in particular, given that, as the European institutions and the United Nations themselves have reported, on many occasions the fight for raw materials is behind many of the world' s conflicts, especially in Africa.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, Europe is continuing to pay for a well-established failing in its conflict prevention policies: we are slow, predictable and not sufficiently authoritative.
I therefore feel that one of the strong points of Mr Lagendijk' s report is that it sees the point at which a political institution such as Europe acquires legitimacy in terms of conflict prevention rather than military force, and it gains legitimacy in the knowledge, not least, that sustainable, equitable peace must be pursued through politics, certainly not through military force.
We particularly welcome the way Mr Lagendijk' s report sees conflict prevention as a result of Europe' s social policies rather than just the effect of good judicial cooperation, although we must never renounce that.
Social policies mean that prevention, the ability to predict, to prevent and to resolve conflicts before they happen must be part of all European Union policies, as has already been pointed out by other Members, and these policies must provide for an investment in terms of both financing and human resources.
In this sense, we feel that the number of European Union delegations to other countries is completely inadequate to meet the requirements of the prevention policy.
As Mr Lagendijk said, we must avoid development cooperation becoming conflict cooperation, and we must therefore be particularly careful, rigorous and rational in developing all our economic policies.
Lastly, I share your criticism of the Council and the Commission for not having accepted in the last six years - and six years is an extremely long time in which countless conflicts occur - the proposal put forward by Parliament at that time to institute a European civil peace corps.
We must prevent conflict, and in order to prevent conflict it is often necessary to take risks, and that is what we are asking the Council, the Commission and Parliament to do.
Mr President, it is good to remind ourselves that at the moment there are many people listening other than those in this House.
I should like to congratulate Mr Lagendijk, precisely on this symbolic day when we awarded the Sakharov Prize to peace activists from Israel, Palestine and Angola.
In my opinion, by broadening our horizons, we retain a sense of realism.
We must assess our present actions in the Middle East and Africa, with three million victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we will need to evaluate what we need to do in Afghanistan.
We must avoid conflicts, conflicts that become militarised or that flare up again.
This requires an integral approach, as has already been underlined by many fellow MEPs.
In my one and a half minutes, I should particularly like to draw your attention to one aspect in the report, namely the Civil Peace Corps.
Commissioner Patten, I really expect you to come up with an initiative.
I am amazed at how much money and how many people can be mobilised over the course of a few months to start a war.
Could we not work in an equally focused manner, deploy as many resources, people, when it comes to keeping the peace and preventing war?
And that is why I applaud this Civil Peace Corps.
The funding and the framework are in place.
If the political will is there, then what are we waiting for!
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his sterling work and focus on three paragraphs towards the end of the report.
Paragraph 24 addresses the need for increased cooperation between the EU and the UN, as well as between the EU and the OSCE.
In this context, I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner responsible for external relations, Mr Patten, about his view on the methods for strengthening co-operation specifically between the UN and the OSCE.
I would also like to draw attention to paragraph 27 on the proliferation of light weapons and small arms and the need for a joint code of conduct for arms exports.
Last but not least, I would like to focus on paragraph 28 on the significance of education as a key element in conflict prevention.
It is a real shame that we cannot have a debate here between the rapporteur and us Members of the European Parliament, as I wonder what view of humanity and what ethic and morals are to form the basis for this work on conflict prevention.
Is it not the case that conflict prevention and democracy ultimately rely on reconciliation, compromise and the ability of each and every one of us to tolerate a defeat?
Finally, on a slightly more personal note, as a member of this Parliament I was dismayed when around 200 Members filed out as Kim Dae Jung was about to speak.
One of Asia' s very greatest advocates of democracy and human rights, Kim Dae Jung has paid a very high personal price for his fight for democracy.
Two hundred Members walked out when he was due to speak.
This is no way to maintain the dignity of Parliament.
Rather, it brought shame on this House.
Mr President, Commissioner, a few hours ago we heard three personalities whom we have awarded the Sakharov Prize.
We were moved by the speeches and inspired by their example, but we were also left with an uncomfortable feeling.
Uncomfortable because, while there is no doubt that in the European Parliament we have succeeded in identifying the ways to prevent and resolve conflicts and recognise, even before others do, who can promote them, we have lacked the effective capacity to influence such processes.
I remember having attended a meeting chaired by President Nicole Fontaine at the beginning of this year, with Commander Massoud.
At the time, few people were interested in the visit and we were unable to mobilise sufficient support to bolster Commander Massoud' s position and, perhaps, prevent some of the great tragedies that followed.
We therefore welcome the Commission' s communication and acknowledge its work and merit.
We fully agree with the strategic principle set out by the Commission, and I quote, "the development policy and other cooperation programmes constitute the most powerful instruments the Community has to deal with the causes of conflicts" .
We support the aims of the document generally; however, we also feel, as does the rapporteur, that there are a few vague aspects, possibly prejudiced by the rigidity of the current system of support.
We believe priority should be given to a strong and serious effort in terms of interinstitutional cooperation.
The specific aspects of this are listed very thoroughly by the rapporteur, whom we congratulate.
But I would like to emphasise one aspect: the role of the Commission' s delegations should be reinforced, which also leads us to the issue of the external representation of the Union.
The document of the Commission, referring to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, mentions joint training of diplomats.
And my question is: when will there be programmes for joint training of diplomats within the European Union itself?
Mr President, there were enough warnings before the crisis in Kosovo really got under way.
Before 11 September, Afghanistan was on the EU' s list of forgotten crisis regions.
I think these are two examples of the way in which we are all too often all too wise all too late.
Unfortunately, when it is too late there is every willingness to employ quite fabulous sums on military action.
This is in stark contrast to the willingness to employ resources on civil crisis prevention and on peacekeeping.
Now, the EU has decided to play an active role in conflict prevention in Africa.
That is something I view in positive terms.
However, we should also play a more active and independent role in relation to the conflict in the Middle East.
That role has unfortunately fallen somewhat by the wayside since 11 September.
The Sakharov Prize is not enough.
We must make pro-active use of the tariff agreement in this crisis.
Mr President, what concerns us is that conflict prevention using military means is just the other side of the same coin, by which I mean of the intervention policy of the European Union, which has nominated itself international peacemaker, especially in crises and conflicts which it itself foments, so that it can then intervene and save the day.
Of course, the objective is always the same: to suppress the progressive grass-roots movement and advance the interests of big business in Europe.
The report by the member of the Group of the Greens, Mr Lagendijk, is not, unfortunately, free of the political, economic and military interventionist spirit.
Without doubt, as the rapporteur himself acknowledged today, the right hand of the proposed non-military rapid reaction unit and European police force will be the European army, which the Laeken Summit will be busy preparing in a few day's time.
Anyway, an official source in the European Union has already stated that military solutions will be imposed wherever political proposals are rejected.
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece cannot vote in favour of the report...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk for another excellent report.
I would also like to welcome his challenging remarks today about, for example, the civil peace corps which I suspect will continue to be a subject of lively debate.
Above all I would like to thank him for what he said about the external aspects of sustainable development.
That is a subject on which we should all focus our attention in the run-up to the Johannesburg Conference next year.
I hope in particular that Parliament will take a special interest in some of the issues he raised, which are of fundamental importance if we are to be credible on sustainable development.
This is a topical debate.
Mr Wiersma suggested it was a Dutch hobby.
I am bound to say that, if it is, it is an extremely good Dutch hobby and I recommend it to every one of the Member States.
There is a growing appreciation of the need to reinforce our efforts to tackle the factors that make conflict and violence arise in the first place.
In the last century, conflict tended to be between states; I do not argue that sort conflict is over and done with. But in today' s world we face a new type of danger - the failed state, the state that is a danger to its own people and a menace to the rest of the world.
Let me be crystal clear. Nothing excuses or mitigates terrorism.
But in rooting out terrorism, we have to work to make sure that the world is hostile terrain - not fertile ground - for terrorists and those who back them.
That can mean taking tough military action, as we do from time to time.
But it also means exporting and entrenching democracy, the rule of law and good government; it means liberalising world trade, and using that and our development assistance to shrink the gap between the richest and the poorest, in a world in which the planet's three richest men own the equivalent of the GDP of the 48 poorest countries.
Earlier this year, the Commission published the communication setting out our new strategy of conflict prevention.
It is based on four main objectives.
First, we want to make a more systematic and coordinated use of the European Union's instruments to address the root causes of conflict.
Simply put, we want to get better leverage from our position as the world' s largest donor and as the top trading bloc.
We are starting by integrating conflict prevention into our strategies towards partner countries, taking account of conflict indicators, for example, in our country strategy papers.
The second objective of our communication is to raise the effectiveness of our actions in tackling 'cross-cutting issues' such as trafficking in drugs or arms, the trading of illicit goods, environmental degradation and so on. On all these fronts, the challenge is immense.
Let me just take, for example, the issue raised by Mrs Ferrer.
The Commission has played, over the last few months, an active role in the Kimberley process, dealing with conflict diamonds.
That is aimed at establishing an international control regime for the import and export of rough diamonds.
After the political agreement reached at Gaborone, two weeks ago, between the participants in this process, the Commission is now launching the preparatory work for the full implementation by the Community of the control regime in the course of next year.
The third objective is to develop our ability to respond rapidly to emerging crises.
Concrete recommendations have been put forward, notably to improve the CFSP instruments, such as political dialogue or the use of special representatives.
I can only agree with Mr Lagendijk that 'conflict prevention implies stronger commitment and political direction on the part of the Member States, as the Community instruments alone are not enough to resolve all possible sources of conflict'.
What is required is a bit more of that old-fashioned commodity - political will.
At Community level, we have set up, at my initiative, a special rapid reaction mechanism to equip us to respond with the speed that events in the real world demand, but which the Commission' s procedures are not always brilliantly designed to cope with.
It is now fully operational, and is proving invaluable in current crises, for example in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Afghanistan where I hope to use the mechanism first of all to provide support for Ambassador Brahimi's team, secondly to provide support for the interim administration and, thirdly, to begin the work of demining.
The fourth message is to promote international cooperation with governments, international organisations and civil society.
The honourable Member raised this.
Mr SacrÃ©deus raised this as well.
The UN is a key partner here.
We have a new framework, agreed by the General Affairs Council in June, for EU-UN enhanced cooperation on conflict prevention and crisis management.
As recommended by Mr Lagendijk, I am ready to work together with the Council on an enhanced framework for cooperation with the OSCE.
Let me finish by giving you one example of what we have we done and what we are doing concretely in a key zone of conflict.
I am just back from the Great Lakes region where we had a useful troika mission.
Last month, we committed funds under the rapid reaction mechanism to support the inter-Congolese dialogue, to launch preparatory actions for the reintegration of child soldiers and to support independent media or other confidence-building initiatives.
In November, we also committed money under the CFSP budget to finance the South African Guard Support Unit for the protection of the recently returned political leaders in Burundi.
I was pleased to be able to meet them and have a briefing from them.
In the region, we continue to carry out rehabilitation, to deliver humanitarian aid and to contribute to poverty alleviation.
We stand ready to finance demilitarisation and demobilisation programmes as soon as they get started.
So we are, I hope and believe, raising our game.
We were starting to do so before the horrific events of three months ago which the honourable Member referred to.
But we know now how much is at stake; we know how preventing conflict abroad is vital to our own security here at home.
We know that we cannot slacken our efforts, but rather, as Mr Lagendijk has argued, we need to redouble those efforts.
That is the very least we should be doing in response to the atrocities of 11 September.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
EU Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran
The next item is the debate on report (A5-0418/2001) by Mr Gahler, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on EU relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran [COM(2001) 71 - C5-0338/2001 - 2001/2138(COS)].
Before we move on to the debate, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that there is going to be a slight alteration to the timetable: with a great deal of effort, we are going to exceed the time limit of 7 p.m.
With the cooperation of the interpretation service, I think that we can work until 7.15 p.m., which means that, from 7.15 p.m. there will be no interpretation service, no Commissioner and no President, because we all have other commitments.
I am sorry to have to tell you this, but this is the truth of the matter.
However, I think that the best way to deal with this situation is to let the rapporteur speak, then the Commissioner, and then the Members of this House, depending on how much time we have left.
Therefore, the more concise we can be, the more possibility there will be of ending the debate before 7.15 p.m.
For those of you who will not be able to speak, you will have the chance to do so once again when we resume at 9 p.m. tonight.
Mr Gahler has the floor.
, rapporteur.
(DE) Mr President, I think we will get the last speakers just before the break.
On 7 February this year, the Commission published a communication on relations between the EU and Iran, in which it notes that dialogue, which began in 1995, has from 1998 onwards been in the form of half-yearly consultations between the troika and the Iranian Government and has taken on a comprehensive character, including global issues such as terrorism, human rights and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as regional issues and cooperation in the areas of drugs, refugees, energy, trade and investment.
According to this communication, the EU, with about 40% of Iranian imports, is Iran's biggest trading partner, but at the same time bilateral relations are impeded by the absence of the framework that a treaty could provide.
The Commission recommends development of closer relations building on the progress made in the following areas: the rule of law, minority rights, freedom of the press, legislative and economic framework conditions and Iran's role in foreign relations and its position on security issues.
Since the communication was published, President Khatami has been confirmed in office by a seventy-five per cent majority, and the world's attention has been focused on Iran's immediate neighbours by the terrorist attacks in the USA, which Iran has unambiguously condemned.
The draft Council decision on negotiation guidelines for a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran, drafted by the Commission, was delivered to the Council on 20 November.
In this report, I have especially tried to shed light on Iran's internal developments in the political, economic and social spheres and to draw from them political conclusions for our attitude towards Iran.
My concern was to explore the EU's interests in enhanced commercial exchanges in view of the country's wealth of raw materials, but also in political dialogue on the fight against terrorism and the trade in drugs, and our respective contributions and potential contributions to resolving the Middle East conflict.
In addition, I would particularly like to make it clear that we in this Parliament take the Commission and the Council at their word, when they take progress in the rule of law, minority rights and press freedom as their benchmark when assessing to what extent relations should be stepped up.
We welcome on principle the planned trade and cooperation agreement and do not make its conclusion conditional on the prior attainment of a specified standard when it comes to the rule of law and respect for human rights.
I wish to highlight two reasons why that requirement can be dispensed with.
One is that we expect the agreement to include a human rights clause comparable to the Cotonou Agreement, which will help us at any time to effectively demand adherence to the international agreements Iran has signed on this subject.
The formularies on this subject in the preamble to the draft mandate, and the general reference to the final provisions on the possibility of suspension in the event of grave offences against significant elements of the treaty do not strike me as adequate.
I am, moreover, convinced that Iranian civil society is capable of implementing under its own steam the reforms appropriate to a modern and developing Islamic society.
Its intellectual potential, shown by its students, press and cultural life, is clear to outsiders.
Looked at as a whole, this country, with its culture and natural raw materials combined with human resources has in essence every chance of opening up to a better future.
However, the fact that elements in the judiciary and the clergy find it necessary to repeatedly ban newspapers, which then often re-establish themselves under new names, shows something of its dualism and contradictions and, in the final analysis, of the still-open question of who should wield power - a question which dominates in almost every area of this society.
The most recent example of this is the disappearance of the journalist and film critic Siamak Pourzand, to which the PEN Club drew attention on 5 December.
We have seen appalling photos in magazines of death sentences being carried out, as they have been to an increasing extent. There have been repeated reports of stoning being used as a method of execution, and there have been many public floggings this year, all of which indicate that ever greater effort is required to keep civil society in check.
The most recent reports by the United Nations also, and also the report of 12 November by Maurice Copithorne, the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights, are noticeably more critical than their equivalents in previous years, in terms of their estimate of the situation and the language they use.
All this makes it, in my view, a matter of urgent necessity that we should for our part build up our contacts and thereby strengthen the forces that the majority of the population know to be behind them.
By that I mean the forces that are in Parliament demanding greater freedom for the press and more rights for women; and the economic sector, which wants to demolish the encrusted structures and to promote a constructive role for Iran in the Middle East peace process.
It is our desire that these forces be encouraged by parliamentary dialogue, so that they may better do justice to the task committed to them by the electorate and to the hopes and expectations of society.
The contradictoriness I have mentioned runs like a thread through other areas.
I gather that Iran, although not actually at the table of the Afghanistan conference in Bonn, played a very constructive role behind the scenes.
I think that should definitely be mentioned to Iran's credit.
Iran could, on the other hand, exert a more moderating influence on certain groups tending to seek confrontation in the Middle East.
The European Parliament will not, though, do a deal on human rights in exchange for participation in the anti-terror coalition.
I expect the Council and the Commission to take a similar line.
Women have struggled to gain a number of positions in parliament, government, administration and culture, more so, perhaps, than in other neighbouring states.
On the other hand, regulations on clothing are imposed on them by male exegetes of the Koran, along with much else besides.
Nor are they adequately represented in many areas of society.
They are quite explicitly not on an equal footing as regards many aspects of the law, for example in family law.
We must - and will - treat all this as a central theme, just as we will acknowledge any progress made.
I would like, in this context, to thank all my colleagues whose amendments have further improved this report.
What mattered to me was that none of the facts should be passed over in silence, but also that the words used should not unnecessarily make the commencement of dialogue more difficult.
It is important in the economic sphere that it be made clear to the Iranians that fundamental reforms are needed, such as, in external terms, conformity with the standards set by the WTO and the opening-up of the market to overseas investors and their products; collaboration in combating drugs is in the interests of both parties, and changes in Afghanistan mean that we must play our part in putting an end to their transit via Iran.
There is an extensive agenda for this dialogue.
We in Parliament want to make contact with our colleagues in the Iranian parliament.
I hope I can count on your support.
I very much welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Gahler, on his excellent work.
I hope the House will understand if I am not able to be here until the end of the debate, but the Commission will be represented.
As a regional power, Iran has an important influence on developments in its area that has sometimes been called the arc of crisis.
We in the European Union have every interest in encouraging the authorities in Teheran to use this influence constructively, to promote stability, cooperation and development in the region.
And as the process of reform and liberalisation goes forward in Iran, we also have every interest to develop our bilateral relations as we tried to do with our troika visit a few weeks ago.
Over the past few years, and especially since the first election of President Khatami in 1997, the European Union has engaged in a broad dialogue with Iran.
It has been useful but now we should go much further.
That is why we recently presented draft directives for the negotiation of a trade and cooperation agreement.
Once we have a contractual basis for our relationship, we will be in a much better position to develop exchanges not just in the economic area, but also on matters such as migration, drugs, energy and the environment.
That will also give us a sounder basis, with real shared interests, for continuing and deepening our political dialogue with Iran on regional and international issues.
We have welcomed Iran's constructive and measured response to the atrocities of 11 September, to which the honourable Member referred.
Even before those terrible events President Khatami launched a very useful initiative in the UN for a Dialogue between Civilisations.
I was interested myself to have an exchange with the president about the works of Nicolo Machiavelli.
I have the impression that Iran fully understands the importance of implementing UN Security Resolution 1373 in the financial fight against terrorism, the need to ratify the twelve existing anti-terrorist conventions, and the need for a comprehensive convention.
In the aftermath of 11 September and in line with the efforts of the global coalition against terrorism, there will be increased scrutiny and less tolerance of states attempting to build arsenals of weapons of mass destruction.
In this regard Iran has adhered to the relevant treaties and conventions, but we want to see additional steps and increased transparency.
Full compliance with these agreements is essential.
We will also welcome co-operation to ensure a better future for Afghanistan under a new, broadly based administration.
We wholeheartedly support and encourage the process of reform in Iran.
But unfortunately things have slipped in the last year.
We share the concerns expressed by the UN Special Rapporteur, Mr Copithorne, in his recent report on human rights in Iran.
So we still have to adopt UN resolutions on this subject.
I believe we should explore other ways of conducting a more effective human rights dialogue with Iran, and I have begun this dialogue with the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
I have repeatedly told my Iranian interlocutors that we are keen to do that, if they also show a real commitment to reform.
The growing contacts of the Iranian authorities with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson, is a promising sign, as is the recent agreement between the UNDP and the Islamic Human Rights Commission on human rights covering monitoring and capacity building.
A lot more can and should be done, and the Commission will watch these developments closely and contribute in whatever way we can.
The potential for EU/Iran cooperation in trade, energy and economic matters is enormous.
That is recognised in our draft mandate for a trade and cooperation agreement.
The discussion among Member States in the Council has already got under way and I hope it will soon lead to a decision allowing us to start negotiations.
As always, there will be some difficulties on detail, but I am confident that everyone accepts that we have a strategic opportunity to develop our relationship with Iran.
In reply to some of the queries in the report, I can confirm that there will of course be a clause on human rights in the agreement, as there is in all our agreements with third countries.
Equally, we will include provisions on readmission of illegal immigrants, while also developing our cooperation with the Iranian authorities on the broader issues of migration.
Finally, I share the honourable Member's pre-occupation with the drugs control issue.
I know that our Iranian counterparts do as well.
So I expect that the agreement will also help us extend and deepen cooperation in this area.
And in terms of the structure of our dialogue with Iran, I wholeheartedly support the suggestion of closer parliamentary contacts.
To conclude, let me thank Mr Gahler again for a very well-argued and balanced report on EU-Iran relations.
I take note of the constructive comments, and am pleased to see that the report encourages the line pursued by the Commission, including the establishment of contractual relations with Iran.
I will report back to Parliament on the progress that is made.
Thank you, Commissioner.
If the debate continues after 9 p.m., then the Commission will of course be represented and will be willing to answer your questions.
However, I thought it would be more appropriate for the competent Commissioner to speak at this time.
Mr President, Iran is particularly noteworthy since it is an area that is surrounded by all manner of countries undergoing turbulence: Afghanistan, the southern Caucasus, Iraq and further away, Palestine.
That in itself is reason enough for expressly concerning ourselves with that country and especially because what we see happening there is not only negative, for there are also some positive developments.
This is why it makes sense to call for a dual-track policy: on the one hand, to maintain effective cooperation in the field of trade, the fight against drugs, against terrorism and such like, and possible cooperation in the reception of refugees, which is a full-scale problem in Iran at the moment, and on the other hand to level tough, clear and honest criticism on everything that contravenes the rule of law, democracy and human rights.
In my view, backed by the underlying attitude that we would like to see more democracy in Iran and the introduction of the rule of law - this can be encouraged in all kinds of ways - we could break through the deadlock which has come about in Iran in the wake of its conflict with the United States.
The EU' s own attitude could possibly break this deadlock, and this is why I warmly welcome what the rapporteur has stated.
We should bear in mind that Shiite Iran, of course, represents, in fact, a modern version of Islam, although there are all kinds of things which we do not like, particularly the fact that a clericracy has declared itself a theocracy, which has always sounded rather blasphemous to me, and which means that the normal, human wishes of young people and women are suppressed.
On the other hand, we should note that the career opportunities of women too can indeed withstand the test of modernity.
With regard to the introduction of democratic wishes, we hear of quite a few positive developments.
In any case, I should like to subscribe to the rapporteur' s conclusion that it is a logical step for us to contact the parliament in Iran, and offer my congratulations to the rapporteur.
Mr President, I feel that this is a balanced report on a complex subject. Its merit is that it lists the signals of progressive opening-up coming from Iran, particularly from its people, who, in the last elections, quite clearly expressed their desire for a policy of economic, social and political reform.
However, at the same time, the ultimate point of reference for us, for the European Union and for Parliament must be respect for human rights.
In this sense, I think we can say to the rapporteur that we do not support some of the amendments he has submitted for the perusal of this plenary in that they seem to be inspired by excessive indulgence in the area of human rights, an area in which we must never make any concessions.
Of course, the Iranian Government has condemned the violence of the destruction which took place on 11 September in New York; of course, it declared its willingness to discuss human rights issues - we welcome that just as we welcome the way that women too have been able to resume their role in the course of recent years in institutions and in schools and university education, and also the Iranian Government' s responsible endeavours to help stabilise the region.
However, certain facts remain, such as the unfulfilled expectations of Iranian society and the international community regarding the abolition of torture, the abolition of the death penalty, the abolition of the special religious courts and press courts and the abolition of particularly degrading and humiliating punishments.
I believe our task is to encourage the democratic forces, civil society and the many women and students who feel that, in the struggle between theocracy and democracy, it is possible for democracy to prevail.
We need to urge the Iranian Government to fully respect the mandate it has received from its people.
Lastly, we must promote political dialogue between the European Union and Iran.
In this sense, we are in favour of sending an ad hoc delegation to Iran and we hope, in particular, that the European Union will be able to play a full, useful political role to help Iran find its own path to democracy as soon as possible.
I feel, Mr President, that it is never our place to judge.
Encouragement and persuasion are part of the spirit of this report and must also characterise the way the European Union reinvigorates its relationship with Iran in the future.
Mr President, we in the Group of the Greens have absolutely nothing against improving economic, cultural and other relations with Iran.
As Commissioner Patten and Mr Gahler have said, positive moves are being made, but there is also much that is negative.
Improved relations should not lead to criticism being weakened.
This report raises the issue of whether criticism of a country with which general cooperation is improving needs to be toned down.
I believe this is a wholly incorrect view but, unfortunately, it appears to be the view of those on the right in this House, who wish to water down Mr Gahler' s report.
In contrast, we believe that the Gahler report has its merits, but that it is too weak and must be made bolder on a number of points.
We have therefore submitted no fewer than ten amendments, of which I will mention only two.
Amendment No 13 is based on the proposal submitted by the EU to the UN, in which the Council is stronger in its criticism than Mr Gahler is in his report.
The amendment mentions issues such as stoning, which continues to occur.
I heard Mr Gahler mention it orally just now, but it is not included in the resolution.
I see this as watering down.
It is an omission not to clearly state that we utterly condemn such a terrible form of punishment.
There are a number of other matters which we believe should be included and which we have addressed in our Amendment No 13.
Amendment No. 19 states that Iran is not a safe country for refugees.
It is very important to point out, in these times of strong sentiment in favour of expelling people from within the EU in a quite haphazard manner, that Iran is a highly unsafe destination for refugees.
Mr President, what I want to say is that the events of 11 September have, I think, made us all much wiser.
The human cost was tremendous but they made us all much wiser, both us and Iran, I think, and we understand the need for new bridges, dialogue, discussion and cooperation between the European Union and Iran to get under way in such an extended, important and dangerous area of instability.
I think that both the troika and Commissioner Patten have done interesting work and I think that the report and the motion for a resolution are generally on the right tack.
However, I must say that there is a little schizophrenia going on.
I am worried that the report contains a double message.
It is like saying to a neighbour with whom you are on bad terms, for whom you have little respect left, "Let us sit at the same table, but just remember that I think you a vulgar, good-for-nothing thief".
That is more or less what our report says.
In paragraph 19, for example, we are, I think, directly intervening in Iran's internal affairs, given the past pattern, the lack of faith in even in the most straightforward people in Iran, who look at the United States, Great Britain and the European Union and suspect that they are about to come and impose their control again.
This being so, I think that we should tread very carefully.
We need to be in favour of the reforms. Not for the reformists or against the conservatives.
As with any other country, we only have the right to insist on our own terms, based on the principles of the European Union and European culture, as the basis for meetings and discussion, but not for intervention if Khatami behaves or the clerics do not.
Because we shall be the ones opening up an opposition front in the European Union.
I think that the logic behind our past and present approach to Turkey, which is now a candidate for integration into the European Union, should also inform our relations with Iran.
This does not mean, I repeat, that we should underestimate the importance either of basic questions of human democratic rights, women's rights, prisoners' rights or the rights of religious minorities.
If we are careful, I think that these steps, which are important to both sides, can be taken.
Mr President, as an historian and ex-journalist, I have been quite fascinated by the emergence of, and developments within, the Islamic Republic of Iran over the years.
This particularly applies to the country' s internal power struggle which flared up recently.
An interesting phenomenon in this connection is that quite a few current reform-minded people were once advocates of the power system they now denounce.
It is only natural that the conservative forces in Iran consider this sense of reform as an erosion of the political system.
They control the essential positions of power and neutralise reformist initiatives at their discretion.
They do not eschew highly repressive means.
With this, we have, in fact, outlined the duality in Iranian society.
The very detailed report by Mr Gahler analyses this in more detail.
We are on the side of the Iranian reformists.
They pursue a more open society and openly denounce coercion in religious matters.
Their fervent opponents, on the other hand, create an uncertain internal climate.
Our hesitation about endorsing a formal trade and cooperation agreement between the EU and Iran is epitomised by two concerns.
These are the violations of constitutional rights - think of the beleaguered position of religious minorities in that country - and the material support to terrorist Lebanese and Palestinian organisations.
On the other hand, an agreement would give us a formal foundation for addressing Tehran on a permanent basis with regard to the social abuses cited by Mr Gahler.
It is of crucial importance, however, that we do not wish to isolate the forces of change internationally in ancient Persia.
In fact, this course of action corresponds to the wishes of the majority of the population.
Like the reform-minded forces in the Islamic Republic, Iranian citizens are reaching out to the west, to Europe for help.
We must lend a truly helping hand.
Thank you, Mr Belder.
This presidency would like to sincerely thank Mr Souladakis for his cooperation this session.
He will obviously be able to speak tomorrow as an extraordinary explanation of vote.
If he wants to repeat his whole speech as an explanation of vote, he will have the opportunity to do so tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.22 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Maritime safety
The next item is the joint debate on:
the report (A5-0440/2001) by Mr Watts, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95/21/EC concerning the enforcement, in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States, of international standards for ship safety, pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions (port State control) (PE-CONS 3657/2001 - C5-0525/2001 - 2000/0065(COD));
the report (A5-0441/2001) by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, on behalf of European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 94/57/EC on common rules and standards for ship inspection and survey organisations and for the relevant activities of maritime administrations (PE-CONS 3656/2001 - C5-0526/2001 - 2000/0066(COD));
the recommendation for second reading (A5-0344/2001), by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design standards for single hull oil tankers and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94 (10221/1/2001 - C5-0389/2001 - 2000/0067(COD)).
Mr President, I should like to begin, perhaps unusually for me, by thanking the various people who have made this evening possible, in particular the Commissioner and all her staff within the maritime unit of her DG, and the maritime safety unit in particular.
Also the Council, who are not represented this evening, but it should go on record how helpful the Belgian Presidency has been.
I should also like to say how helpful the French presidency was in making sure that we made rapid progress.
I should also like to thank my colleagues in the European Parliament who stood together through this process, with the difficult challenges we faced, but which we overcame together.
Because of that we are able tonight to celebrate a historic victory for the European institutions in the field of maritime safety.
Together we have achieved a great deal.
I will not dwell on the other reports. My fellow rapporteurs will do that.
I should like to focus on my report on port state control, which is an essential part of our regime to make sure that events such as that involving the Erika never happen again.
Two years ago today the Erika was a symptom of a failed system of maritime safety.
It was not the first of its kind, nor, sadly, was it the last maritime disaster of its kind.
It symbolised to me and my colleagues in the European Parliament the fact that the flag state controls had failed.
The classification society controls had failed. The port state controls had failed and the IMO itself had failed.
It is only because of the collective action of the European Union and its institutions that we have stimulated in the last two years unparalleled levels of activity in the field of maritime safety.
Without the European Union, we would not be as advanced today as we are.
We should all be very pleased that we have the European Union to spearhead action in this area.
What do we have to be so pleased and proud about?
I want to list some of the achievements that we have secured in respect of port state control.
Firstly, there is going to be mandatory inspection for certain ships.
That is an innovation and I welcome it.
It means that the most dangerous ships will be inspected in future.
Secondly, enhanced inspection for other categories of ships and, thirdly, the guidelines on inspections themselves will become mandatory.
In other words port state control authorities will have to inspect certain types of ships in certain ways.
Fourthly, we want the Member States that have been a weak link in the system to train and recruit adequate numbers of port state control inspectors.
They will have until 2003 to do that, but it is a challenge for them and it is a challenge, I hope, that they can rise to.
Fifthly - and this is absolutely critical to the success of this new regime - we want public access to the information.
Again that is in the amended directive and will be made available via the Equasis database.
Sixthly, we want the Member States and the port state control authorities in particular, to convey the information to the Commission so that the Commission can do its job in making sure the amended directive is uniformly implemented across the European Union.
The seventh point, which I mention with a certain pleasure, concerns the ability to ban and detain certain ships - banning the most dangerous ships, particularly those that fly the flags of blacklisted flag states.
I welcome the strong controls we have to ban certain ships from European Union waters if they have a poor detention record.
That effectively will be a warning shot across the bows of these blacklisted flag states: over a period of time their ships will be banned one by one if they do not improve.
A very important message will be going out from this Parliament.
But also there will be the power to detain, in particular the power to detain ships which, by 2008, do not have a fully functioning voice data recorder, a black box.
Again the message can go out tonight that by 2008 all categories of ships, if they want to come to a European port, must have a black box voice data recorder.
If they do not have one, we will detain the ship until one is secured.
