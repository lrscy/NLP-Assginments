It
was
true
that
they
could
be
approximated
,
but
would
the
Ozagenians
understand
these
approximations
?

Another
obstacle
was
the
grammatical
construction
of
Siddo

Consider
the
tense
system
.
<EOS>
< sentence ID =116>
Instead
of
inflecting
a
verb
or
using
an
unattached
particle
to
indicate
the
past
or
future
,
Siddo
used
an
entirely
different
word
.
<EOS>
< sentence ID =117>
Thus
,
the
masculine
animate
infinitive
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai
,
meaning
to
live
,
was
,
in
the
perfect
tense
,
ksu'u'peli'afo
,
and
,
in
the
future
,
mai'teipa
